You are tasked with labeling academic abstracts as either belonging to the Telecommunications category or not. For each abstract:

- Review the provided abstract carefully.
- Assign a confidence score (between 0 and 1) to the abstract. The score represents your certainty that the abstract falls into the Telecommunications category.
- Your output should be a single float between 0 and 1.

The labels will be used by research institutions to categorize the abstracts. Accuracy is crucial.
