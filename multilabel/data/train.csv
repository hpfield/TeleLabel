"Title: Co-Inform - Co-Creating Misinformation-Resilient Societies Abstract: Misinformation generates misperceptions, which have affected policies in many domains, including economy, health, environment, and foreign policy. Co-Inform is about empowering citizens, journalists, and policymakers with co-created socio-technical solutions, to increase resilience to misinformation, and to generate more informed behaviors and policies. The aim of Co-Inform is to co-create these solutions, with citizens, journalists, and policymakers, for (a) detecting and combating a variety of misinforming posts and articles on social media, (b) supporting, persuading, and nourishing misinformation-resilient behavior, (c) bridging between the public on social media, external fact checking journalists, and policymakers, (d) understanding and predicting which misinforming news and content are likely to spread across which parts of the network and demographic sectors, (e) infiltrating echo-chambers on social media, to expose confirmation-biased networks to different perceptions and corrective information, and (f) providing policymakers with advanced misinformation analysis to support their policy making process and validation. 

To achieve these goals, Co-Inform will bring together a multidisciplinary team of scientists and practitioners, to foster co-creational methodologies and practices for engaging stakeholders in combating misinformation posts and news articles, combined with advanced intelligent methods for misinformation detection, misinformation flow prediction, and real-time processing and measurement of crowds' acceptance or refusal of misinformation. Co-Inform tools and platform will be made freely available and open sourced to maximize benefit and reuse. Three main stakeholder groups will be directly engaged throughout this process; citizens, journalists, and policymakers.","[""telecommunications networks""]"
"Title: SmartGraphene - Graphene based smart surfaces: from visible to microwave Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to develop adaptive camouflage systems using graphene-enabled smart surfaces. We propose a new class of active surfaces capable of real-time electrical-control of its appearance in a very broad spectrum ranging from visible to microwave covering 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The proposed method relies on controlling electromagnetic waves by tuning density of high-mobility charges on single or multilayers of atomically thin graphene electrodes. We will realize this goal by efficient gating of large-area graphene using ionic liquids which yields unprecedented ability to control intensity and phase of the reflected and transmitted electromagnetic waves from the surface. Based on underlying physical mechanisms and applications, the proposed research plan is structured in 3 main directions; (1) Active surfaces in microwave and THz, (2) Active thermal surfaces, and (3) Active surfaces in the visible. 

The core idea of the proposal is based on a mutually-gated capacitor structure consisting of ionic liquid electrolyte sandwiched between two large area graphene. The voltage applied between the electrodes polarizes the ionic liquid and accumulates high-density of charges. Combining large scale chemical synthesis of graphene, novel device architectures and ionic liquid electrolyte we will develop new tools to understand and control light-matter interaction in a very broad spectrum. Then we will use these tools to fabricate new camouflage and display technologies on flexible polymers and paper substrates which cannot be realized by conventional semiconducting materials. We will challenge specific applications, such as THz compressive imaging, reconfigurable thermal shields, and electronic paper display.

 At the basic science level, this project revisits and challenges our basic understanding of light-matter interaction, in parallel, the proposed graphene-based smart surfaces will serve as a tool for developing new enabling technologies.","[""radar""]"
"Title: NEUROCLOUD - A neural network builder with remotely controlled parallel computing Abstract: Neural network simulations have been a driving force behind our advances in the artificial intelligence filed, but also a key tool in our understanding of the human brain. However, exploring such networks usually engages substantial computational resources requiring specific programing skills and dedicated facilities. In our main project NETSIGNAL, we have developed computational environment ARACHNE aiming to facilitate high-end neural network exploration among scientific and industrial users. ARACHNE enables an investigator to construct and explore cellular networks of arbitrary biophysical and architectural complexity using a simple interface on a local computer or a mobile device. Through small-file exchange via the internet, the interface controls a pre-configured computational kernel installed on a remote computer cluster or cloud. Uniquely, ARACHNE can integrate traditional wired network connections with diffuse, volume-transmitted type of inter-cellular signalling, to reflect the emerging role of glia in brain processing. ARACHNE thus affords a flexible neural network design and incorporates latest advances in neuroscience while providing a portable console suitable for IT-untrained explorers. ARACHNE has passed a feasibility and novelty test by independent experts (Aleksin et al, PLoS Comp Biology 2017, in press), its test version is available on-line (https://github.com/LeonidSavtchenko/Arachne/). Our goal here is to determine market potential and the commercial viability of ARACHNE and its conceptual design, but also to establish industry-standard provisions for its commercial exploitation. We plan: (a) to upgrade ARACHNE technical specs, interface, support, etc. to the industry standard; (b)  to assess the market and the competitors; (c) to determine IPR position and strategy, (d) to explore budgeting and further funding strategy, (e) to establish initial provisions for its distribution and/or licensing of ARACHNE.","[""mobile network""]"
"Title: IDentIFY - Improving Diagnosis by Fast Field-Cycling MRI Abstract: Many diseases are inadequately diagnosed, or not diagnosed early enough by current imaging methods. Examples of unmet clinical needs arise in thromboembolic disease, osteoarthritis, cancer, sarcopenia, and many more areas. Our solution, Fast Field-Cycling (FFC) MRI, can measure quantitative information that is invisible to standard MRI. FFC scanners switch magnetic field while scanning the patient, obtaining new diagnostic information. FFC-MRI has been demonstrated by us, but many challenges must be solved before clinical adoption.
Objectives:
Understand the mechanisms determining FFC signals in tissues;
Create technology to measure and correct for environmental magnetic fields, enabling FFC at ultra-low fields;
Investigate contrast agents for FFC, to increase sensitivity and to allow molecular imaging;
Improve FFC technology, in order to extend its range of clinical applications;
Test FFC-MRI on tissue samples and on patients.
Achieved by:
Developing the theory of relaxation in tissue at ultra-low fields, leading to models and biomarkers;
Developing magnetometers for FFC-MRI, and environmental-field correction;
Creating and in vitro testing of new FFC contrast agents; studying existing clinical agents for FFC-MRI sensitivity;
Improving technology to monitor and stabilise magnetic fields in FFC; improving magnet power supply stability; investigating better radiofrequency coils and acquisition pulse sequences;
Testing FFC methods on tissue samples from surgery and tissue banks; proof-of-principle scans on patients.
FFC-MRI is a paradigm-shifting technology which will generate new, quantitative disease biomarkers, directly informing and improving clinical diagnosis, treatment decisions and treatment monitoring. Its lower cost contributes to healthcare sustainability. The proposal consolidates the EU lead in FFC technology and uses new concepts from world-leading teams to deliver solutions based on innovations in theory, modelling, physics, chemistry and engineering.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: MolCellTissMech - Molecular and cellular determinants of cell monolayer mechanics Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are amongst the simplest tissues in the body, yet they play fundamental roles in adult organisms where they separate the internal environment from the external environment and in development when the intrinsic forces generated by cells within the monolayer drive tissue morphogenesis. The mechanics of these simple tissues is dictated by the cytoskeletal and adhesive proteins that interface the constituent cells into a tissue-scale mechanical syncitium. Mutations in these proteins lead to diseases with fragilised epithelia. However, a quantitative understanding of how subcellular structures govern monolayer mechanics, how cells sense their mechanical environment and what mechanical forces participate in tissue morphogenesis is lacking.

To overcome these challenges, my lab devised a new technique to study the mechanics of load-bearing monolayers under well-controlled mechanical conditions while allowing imaging at subcellular, cellular and tissue resolutions. Using this instrument, my proposal aims to understand the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics as well as the cellular behaviours that drive tissue morphogenesis.  I will focus on four objectives: 1) discover the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics, 2) characterise monolayer mechanics, 3) dissect how tension is sensed by monolayers, and 4) investigate the biophysics of individual cell behaviours participating in tissue morphogenesis.

Together these studies will enable us to understand how monolayer mechanics is affected by changes in single cell behaviour, subcellular organisation, and molecular turnover. This multi-scale characterisation of monolayer mechanics will set the stage for new theoretical descriptions of living tissues involving both molecular-scale phenomena (cytoskeletal turnover, contractility, and protein unfolding) operating on short time-scales and rearrangements due to cell-scale phenomena (cell intercalation, cell division) acting on longer times.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: 5G-AURA - Application-aware User-centric Programmable Architectures for 5G Multi-tenant Networks Abstract: The vision of future 5G networks encompasses a heterogeneous communication landscape in which existing Radio Access Technologies (RATs) will be integrated with evolving wireless technologies and systems, software-design network architectures and cloud-enabled services. Effectively harnessing the potential of all these innovative and heterogeneous features and providing a programmable multi-tenant network architectural framework will be the key to the success of 5G, and will be the main objective of the 5G-AURA project. Instead of focusing separately on the optimization of the diverse technological and architectural components, our efforts will be concentrated on providing a unifying framework that will sustain the coexistence and coordination of networking, software and cloud technologies, ensure network programmability and efficient resource orchestration, minimize control and signalling overhead, support multi-tenancy and scalability, and promote the development of new business models for emerging services. To efficiently achieve these objectives, 5G-AURA has identified 12 specific research challenges which have been mapped to 14 individual projects that will be carried out by 14 recruited ESRs. The project’s consortium, formed by four academic institutions and four industrial partners, has the necessary expertise and available infrastructures to form a high quality training network across multiple disciplines, sectors and countries. Considering that 5G is currently in an early development state and there are multiple open issues on 5G protocols, network architectures and technologies and standardization efforts, the timing of 5G-AURA is perfect, and the project has a strong potential to have significant impact on academia and industry and enhance the European innovation capacity in terms of technical contributions, intersectoral training of scientists and professional and novel business opportunities.","[""5G""]"
"Title: PANBioRA - Personalized And/Or Generalized Integrated Biomaterial Risk Assessment Abstract: PANBioRA aims at providing a comprehensive solution for the time- and cost-effective risk assessment of i) new biomaterials under health or disease states or ii) a given biomaterial for each patient in a personalized manner. It will standardize the evaluation of biomaterials and open the venue for pre-implantation, personalized diagnostics for biomaterial based applications.   
PANBioRA will provide a modular platform to assess risks at different aspects and length scales. This comprises antibody response, cytotoxicity/genotoxicity at cell level, systemic and local effects at tissue and connected tissues (organ-on-a-chip) level. Moreover, physicochemical and biomechanical characterisation as well as predictive modelling at systems level will complement the system. This will be achieved by connecting testing modules in a structure supported by web-based modelling and risk radar tools together with a biomechanical testing system.
The platform will incorporate standardized protocols yielding significantly more information than the current methods for biomaterial risk assessment. Its accuracy will be demonstrated using known reference materials and validated in a pre-clinical setting.
PANBioRA will for the first time, predict the patient specific response to a given biomaterial before its implantation. This measure will allow for the selection of the best suitable material, minimizing side effects and improving health outcomes. 
It will also accelerate the process of validation of the biocompatibility of new devices by providing an automated, comprehensive process for the parallel assessment of risks at different scales aiding new biomaterial discovery and commercialisation. 
Altogether, PANBioRA will lead to a substantial economic impact due to a reduction of the amount of tests, decrease in healthcare costs due to complications. It will provide the necessary tools proper risk management related to biomaterials.","[""radar""]"
"Title: SCREEN - Space Cognitive Radio for Electromagnetic Environment maNagement Abstract: The SCREEN project brings the concept of cognitive radio to Space and exploits the benefits that this technology has already shown in the terrestrial domain. The project will look into analysing, developing, implementing and testing cognitive radio algorithms. The ground breaking element in SCREEN is however the implementation and testing. Even though some of the underlying technologies for the individual stages are not novel, the incorporation of all stages in a radio transceiver has never been done to the full extent of a cognitive, and not adaptive, system.

The key enabling technology for cognitive radio is Software-Defined Radio (SDR), which provides the required flexibility to reconfigure the radio parameters autonomously and without any changes in the transceiver hardware. The Consortium will make use of proprietary SDR technology and use it for the implementation and testing. In fact, the project approach is to make use of terrestrial research results in cognitive radio at all levels (technological, market and regulatory) and capitalise the previous work done in different projects, avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts. The target spectrum band for this project is S-band, which is underexplored and has a strong potential for future niche applications both in satcom and in ISLs for multi-satellite missions. It also brings advantages regarding regulatory concerns.

This project clearly fits the topic, not only because its main goal is to evolve an innovative technology up to TRL4/5, but also because cognitive radio is a key enabling technology for the areas identified by the topic. This technology will lead to a new generation of satcom payloads and also have massive impact on ISLs and downlink subsystems. It also brings a terrestrial technology to space, together with new players, which has the possibility to dramatically improve the performance, efficiency and versatility of space communications.","[""cognitive radio""]"
"Title: TESTBED - Testing and Evaluating Sophisticated information and communication Technologies for enaBling a smartEr griD Abstract: Smart grid represents a significant new technology of improving the efficiency, reliability, and economics of the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity. It is crucial to exchange and use information for performing smart grid applications. However, in reality the exchange of information over multiple networks is unreliable, leading to unpredictable network Quality-of-Service and thus unreliable smart grid applications. What’s worse, there are massive data, including metering data and measurement data,  structured or unstructured, making it challenging to exploit useful information. Hence, there is an urgent need to solve the research problem: how to coordinate multiple networks to reliably transmit data, and then manage ICT system resources to efficiently extract useful information for supporting smart grid applications?
TESTBED is a major interdisciplinary project that combines wisdoms in three academic disciplines - Electronics Engineering, Power Engineering and Computing Sciences, to address the aforesaid problem. The main focus is on improving the communication layer interoperability and the efficiency of data analytic. Regarding the communication layer interoperability, this project intends to develop and evaluate function-driven communication frameworks. Moreover, this project will develop and verify new data integration and analytic techniques for enhancing power grid operations. These developed frameworks and methods will be extensively tested and evaluated in 4 well-equipped Laboratories at HWU, EPRI, ICCS, and CAS. They will not only support the SGAM Framework, but also complement and enhance International Standards. 
Overall, the main objective of this project is to coordinate the action of 5 Universities and 3 enterprises, working in the field of ICT and smart grid from both EU and China, to build and test sophisticated ICT, thereby facilitating the successful implementation of smart grid applications.","[""telecommunications networks"", ""cognitive radio""]"
"Title: COSAFE - Cooperative Connected Intelligent Vehicles for Safe and Efficient Road Transport Abstract: Road accidents and traffic congestion are causing serious problems for global transport systems.

"Title: FANTASTIC-5G - Flexible Air iNTerfAce for Scalable service delivery  wiThin wIreless Communication networks of the 5th Generation Abstract: 5G will have to cope with a high degree of heterogeneity in terms of: (a) services (mobile broadband, massive machine and mission critical communications, broad-/multicast services and vehicular communications); (b) device classes (low-end sensors to high-end tablets); (c) deployment types (macro and small cells); (d) environments (low-density to ultra-dense urban); (e) mobility levels (static to high-speed transport).
Consequently, diverse and often contradicting Key Performance Indicators need to be supported, such as high capacity/user-rates, low latency, high reliability, ubiquitous coverage, high mobility, massive number of devices, low cost/energy consumption. 4G is not designed to meet such a high degree of heterogeneity efficiently. Moreover, having multiple radio access technologies for multi-service support below 6GHz will be too costly.
FANTASTIC-5G will develop a new multi-service Air Interface (AI) for below 6 GHz through a modular design. To allow the system to adapt to the anticipated heterogeneity, the pursued properties are: flexibility, scalability, versatility, efficiency, future-proofness. To this end, we will develop the technical AI components (e.g. flexible waveform and frame design, scalable multiple access procedures, adaptive retransmission schemes, enhanced multi-antenna schemes with/without cooperation, advanced multi-user detection, interference coordination, support for ultra-dense cell layouts, multi-cell radio resource management, device-to-device) and integrate them into an overall AI framework where adaptation to the above described sources of heterogeneity will be accomplished. Our work will also comprise intense validation and system level simulations.
FANTASTIC-5G includes partners being active in forerunning projects like METIS, 5GNOW and EMPATHIC ensuring the exploitation of the respective outcomes. The consortium possesses the main stakeholders for innovation and impacting standardization, maintaining Europe at the forefront.","[""5G"", ""4G"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: 5GENESIS - 5th Generation End-to-end Network, Experimentation, System Integration, and Showcasing Abstract: In the global race towards 5G, the establishment and implementation of the 5G-PPP programme in the EU has significantly strengthened the position of Europe, promoting both technological excellence and industrial leadership. So far, 5G-PPP Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects have been proven quite successful in developing focused solutions, targeting specific technical innovations. Now, the crucial next step in the “Genesis of 5G”, in Europe but also worldwide, is to integrate all these highly diverse results and technologies in order to “glue together” the 5G picture and unveil the potential of a truly full-stack, end-to-end 5G platform, able to meet the defined KPI targets.  In this context, the main goal of 5GENESIS to validate 5G KPIs for various 5G use cases, in both controlled set-ups and large-scale events. This will be achieved by bringing together results from a considerable number of EU projects as well as the partners’ internal R&D activities in order to realise an integrated End-to-end 5G Facility, built on five diverse in terms of capabilities –yet fully interoperable- experimentation platforms distributed across Europe and interconnected with each other. The platforms will emerge as the evolution of existing testbeds, already owned and operated by the 5GENESIS partners, suitable for large-scale field experimentation. The 5GENESIS Facility, as a whole, will: - implement and verify all evolutions of the 5G standard, via an iterative integration and testing procedure; - engage a wide diversity of technologies and chain innovations that span over all domains, achieving full-stack coverage of the 5G landscape; - unify heterogeneous physical and virtual network elements under a common coordination and openness framework exposed to experimenters from the vertical industries and enabling end-to-end slicing and experiment automation; and - support further experimentation projects, in particular those focused on vertical markets.","[""5G""]"
"Title: ELVER - Engineering with Logic and Verification: Mathematically Rigorous Engineering for Safe and Secure Computer Systems Abstract: Computer systems have become critical to modern society, but they are pervasively subject to security flaws and malicious attacks, with large-scale exposures of confidential data, denial-of-service and ransom attacks, and the threat of nation-state attackers: they are trusted, but are far from trustworthy. This is especially important for the major pan-industry components of our information infrastructure: processors, programming languages, operating systems, etc.

The basic problem is that conventional engineering techniques suffice only to make systems that *usually* work. The usual test-and-debug development methods, with poorly specified abstractions described in prose, lack the mathematical rigour of other engineering disciplines - yet the huge investment in legacy systems and skills makes it hard to improve.

ELVER will develop *mathematically rigorous* methods for specifying, testing, and reasoning about *real systems*, focussed on the core mechanisms used by hardware and software to enforce security boundaries.  It will establish mathematical models for the industry ARM architecture, used pervasively in mobile phones and embedded devices, and the CHERI research architecture, which protects against many attacks. Using these, ELVER will build tools for analysis of system software, develop techniques for mathematical proof of safety and security properties, and explore improved systems programming languages.  ELVER will build on successful collaborations with ARM, IBM, and the C/C++ ISO standards committees.  It will directly impact mainstream processor architectures, languages, and development methods, smoothly complementing existing methods while simultaneously enabling longer-term research towards the gold standard of provably secure systems.

ELVER will thus demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a more rigorous approach to system engineering, putting future systems on more solid foundations, and hence making them safer and more secure","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: WASPSNEST - Wavelength tunable Advanced Single Photon Sources Non-laboratory Environment Specification and Testing Abstract: Triggered single photon sources are key enabling tools in the new technology of quantum communications and a host of quantum optics research, but have not found widespread use because robust and portable devices have yet to be commercialised. The FP7 WASPS project is completing laboratory-based demonstrator experiments for a new range of plug-in single photon sources that can ultimately be operated at ambient temperatures and in non-laboratory environments. The devices, based on nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond coupled to optical microcavities, offer a degree of wavelength tunability and a flexible design in which the active component can be replaced and upgraded. Work towards construction of a field-testable prototype device has started. In this Innovation Launchpad project, we propose to carry out critical steps in the development and field testing of this prototype that will provide key performance information to companies looking to manufacture and market the technology. These will involve innovative refinement of the active module containing the cavity and single photon emitter, development of module assembly protocols compatible with manufacturing, and testing of the prototype in a free-space quantum key distribution system. The project will bring robust triggered single photon sources closer to market and will promote innovation and entrepreneurship within the H2020 FET programme.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: 5G-Crosshaul - 5G-Crosshaul: The 5G Integrated fronthaul/backhaul Abstract: Mobile data traffic is forecasted to increase 11-fold between 2013 and 2018. 5G networks serving this mobile data tsunami will require fronthaul and backhaul solutions between the RAN and the packet core capable of dealing with this increased traffic load while fulfilling new stringent 5G service requirements in a cost-efficient manner.
The 5G-Crosshaul project aims at developing a 5G integrated backhaul and fronthaul transport network enabling a flexible and software-defined reconfiguration of all networking elements in a multi-tenant and service-oriented unified management environment. The 5G-Crosshaul transport network envisioned will consist of high-capacity switches and heterogeneous transmission links (e.g., fibre or wireless optics, high-capacity copper, mmWave) interconnecting Remote Radio Heads, 5GPoAs (e.g., macro and small cells), cloud-processing units (mini data centres), and points-of-presence of the core networks of one or multiple service providers.  This transport network will flexibly interconnect distributed 5G radio access and core network functions, hosted on in-network cloud nodes, through the implementation of: (i) a control infrastructure using a unified, abstract network model for control plane integration (5G-Crosshaul Control Infrastructure, XCI); (ii) a unified data plane encompassing innovative high-capacity transmission technologies and novel deterministic-latency switch architectures (5G-Crosshaul Packet Forwarding Element, XFE).  
Demonstration and validation of the 5G-Crosshaul technology components developed will be integrated into a software-defined flexible and reconfigurable 5G Test-bed in Berlin.

"Title: 5GCITY - 5GCITY Abstract: Delivering on the 5G promise of increased data rates, and ubiquitous coverages, poses stringent requirements on traditional vertically integrated operators. In particular, telecom operators are expected to massively  roll out Small Cells, which requires finding appropriate urban spaces with both backhaul and energy availability. Network sharing becomes essential to unlock those commercial massive deployments. The open access model, or neutral host, will come to play a key role on the deployment of 5G networks, especially in urban scenarios where very dense Small Cell deploymens are required. 
In parallel recent trends are paving the way towards the development of new, heterogeneous and distributed cloud paradigms that significantly differ from today’s established cloud model: with edge computing, cloud architectures are pushed all the way to the edge of the network, close to the devices that produce and act on data. We posit that there are two sets of players perfectly poised to take advantage of both trends since they already own the infrastructure needed to build edge deployments: telecommunication providers and municipalities. 5GCity focuses on how common smart city infrastructure (i.e.,small cells and processing power at the very edge of networks) can bring benefit to both players based on resource sharing and end-to-end virtualization, pushing the cloud model to the extreme edge. 
5GCity will design, develop, deploy and demonstrate a distributed cloud and radio platform for municipalities and infrastructure owners acting as 5G neutral hosts. 5GCity’s main aim is to build and deploy a common, multi-tenant, open platform that extends the (centralized) cloud model to the extreme edge of the network, with a demonstration in three different cities (Barcelona, Bristol and Lucca). 5GCity will directly impact a large and varied range of actors: (i) telecom providers; (ii) municipalities; and (iii) a number of different vertical sectors utilizing the city infrastructure","[""5G""]"
"Title: HRadio - Hybrid Radio everywhere for everyone Abstract: HRADIO (Hybrid Radio everywhere for everyone) focuses on radio service innovations enabled by convergence. While radio, with its rich editorial content, remains a highly popular medium, listening figures are slowly declining, particularly among youngsters. With the rapid rise of smartphones, radio faces competition from many new services including music steaming platforms. Regular radio today often does not include attractive features as known from vertical platforms. And if present, they are mostly not well integrated with the actual radio programme. This is where HRADIO will deliver.
Driven by the industry need to create attractive new radio experiences, the project will leverage the full potential of hybrid technology for radio – enabling the integration of cost-effective broadcast distribution with new online features. Broadcasters will be enabled to personalise radio services (while respecting privacy), to provide intuitive functionalities like time-shifting and, eventually, to foster and to exploit user engagement. HRADIO will pave the way to bring these features not only to broadcasters’ native mobile applications, but also to portals, to connected radios and into the car. The core approach is to integrate validated solutions and to harmonise APIs which together will provide broadcasters with an abstracted service layer accessible across any device and distribution platform – ensuring sustainability and return of investment. Therefore, consumers will be able to access their personal radio services on different devices and platforms enabled by a seamless broadcast-internet integration for radio content distribution. All features will be tested in 3 phases of large-scale pilots involving broadcasters, app developers for mobile and automotive devices. 
Eventually, HRADIO will publish its developments as ready-to-use Android and HTML client implementations including an extensive set of well documented APIs fostering new service developments for the radio sector.","[""radio and television"", ""mobile phones""]"
"Title: OCTAVE - Objective Control for TAlker VErification Abstract: Industry needs alternatives to textual passwords for access control. While tokens can still be stolen or transferred to other persons, biometrics technology can provide reliable, cost-effective and user-friendly solutions.
The proliferation of smart services calls for unsupervised authentication at a distance. Being natural, non-intrusive and readily compatible with smart and mobile devices, automatic speaker verification (ASV) is an appealing solution. Even so, today’s state-of-the-art ASV systems lack robustness to environmental variability and are vulnerable to spoofing. Concerns regarding interoperability, scalability and privacy also form barriers to exploitation.
While embracing standards, in addition to a privacy and interoperability-by-design ethos, OCTAVE will integrate commercial-grade and new, hybrid ASV systems with the latest environmental robustness and anti-spoofing technologies to deliver a scalable, trusted biometric authentication service (TBAS). While simultaneously relieving end-users from the inconvenience of dealing with textual passwords, the OCTAVE platform will reduce the economic and practical burdens related to password loss and recovery. The TBAS will support single (text-dependent, text-prompted and text-independent) in addition to hybrid operating modes. The delegation of authentication to a single, yet distributed TBAS, will increase trust and privacy, avoid single points of failure and allow for rapid breach notification and remediation.
Solutions will be installed in data-sensitive and mission-critical services and validated in two real commercial trials: banking services and physical access within a critical airport infrastructure. Flexibility will support wider exploitation in future applications in, for example, customer care, telephone banking, e-commerce, logical and physical access control. OCTAVE will thus fuel new opportunities for commercial services making use of electronic identification and authentication.","[""mobile phones""]"

Satcom systems are the only economic solution to address these scenarios provided that they are seamlessly integrated into the future 5G architecture and optimum efficiency is achieved via technological synergies between 5G mobile and satcom systems.

SaT5G will bring satcom into 5G by defining optimal satellite-based backhaul and traffic offloading solutions. It will research, develop and validate key 5G technologies in order to take the best value of satcom capabilities (e.g. multicast for content and VNF delivery, ubiquity and resiliency) and mitigate its inherent constraints (e.g. latency). It will identify novel business models and economically viable operational collaborations that integrate the satellite and terrestrial stakeholders in a win-win situation. SaT5G will validate, through specific research pillars, the required technology bricks that will enable the targeted markets to be addressed.

This will be demonstrated through integration of the project results in an industrial prototype of a Low Visibility Explorer Robot for providing situational awareness based on a commercial platform from partner TAUR. In close collaboration with TAUR (robotics industry) and end users (FDDO, end users in the advisory group), SmokeBot will crucially improve the abilities of the selected platform, thus increasing safety of rescue staff and European citizens as well as improving the product of a European robotics company in an important market. An even wider impact is expected through the development of a novel sensor unit and the corresponding cognitive approaches. In addition to traditional sensors such as LIDAR and cameras, which are affected by smoke or dust, this sensing unit includes also a novel 3D radar camera, a thermal camera, and high-bandwidth gas sensors. Fusion of sensor modalities will allow the inclusion of measurements from LIDAR and camera into the world model when they occasionally penetrate through e.g. smoke. In addition, we will develop the means to integrate prior knowledge in the form of crude human sketch maps to allow for robust mapping and navigation even under low visibility in a harsh environment. Sensor technology from SmokeBot will result in new products to be brought to market after the project. Software developed will be made available as open source.","[""radar""]"
"Title: WiseCure - Wireless, Scalable and Implantable Optogenetics for Neurological Disorders Cure Abstract: This WiseCure Fellowship aims to bring novel wireless, scalable, MRI-compatible, and bio-integrated neural implants for optogenetics to treat epilepsy. Neurological diseases such as epilepsy is a life-threatening progressive disorder causing uncontrolled activity of the brain (seizure). The ability to decipher brain functions and understand the neuronal communication networking properties to develop innovative solutions to treat neurological diseases remains one of the biggest challenges to date. A recent approach to study the brain is optogenetics. Optogenetics is a neural modulation technique which utilizes light to stimulate genetically engineered neurons, providing a better option for controlling the cells compared to conventional electrical stimulation.  Scientists pursuing optogenetic therapies still face some technical challenges (e.g. size and multifunctional capability, biointegration, wireless capability, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatibility) that keeping optogenetics from clinical trials for brain diseases. I will combine the innovative wireless power transfer (WPT) approaches with ultrathin, soft and flexible biocompatible polymeric platforms to fabricate and characterize neural implants that are small enough to promote scalability, chronic reliability, and MRI compatibility. By associating the ability to wirelessly monitor (e.g. neural activities) and control (stimulation or inhibition) through these neural implants using a smartphone establishes a novel approach for versatile optogenetics to treat epilepsy.  This Fellowship will act as a platform to realize my futuristic vision by integrating the wireless optogenetics system into smart healthcare using mobile and electronic technology for better diagnosis of the brain diseases, improved treatment of the patients, and enhanced quality of lives.","[""mobile phones"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: VICINITY - Open virtual neighbourhood network to connect intelligent buildings and smart objects Abstract: The lack of interoperability is considered as the most important barrier to achieve the global integration of IoT ecosystems across borders of different disciplines, vendors and standards. Indeed, the current IoT landscape consists of a large set of isolated islands that do not constitute a real internet, preventing the exploitation of the huge potential expected by ICT visionaries.

To overcome this situation, VICINITY presents a virtual neighborhood concept, which is a decentralized, bottom-up and cross-domain approach that resembles a social network, where users can configure their set ups, integrate standards according to the services they want to use and fully control their desired level of privacy. VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services.

VICINITY's approach will be demonstrated by a large-scale demonstration connecting 8 facilities in 7 different countries. The demonstration covers various domains including energy, building automation, health and transport. VICINITY's potential to create new, domain-crossing services will be demonstrated by value added services such as micro-trading of DSM capabilities, AI-driven optimization of smart urban districts and business intelligence over IoT.

Open calls are envisioned in the project to integrate further, preferably public, IoT infrastructures and to deploy additional added value services. This will not only extend the scale of VICINITY demonstration, but also efficiently raise the awareness of industrial communities of VICINITY and its capabilities.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: EPIC - Enabling Practical Wireless Tb/s Communications with Next Generation Channel Coding Abstract: EPIC aims to develop a new generation of Forward-Error-Correction (FEC) codes to enable practical wireless Tb/s link technology—corresponding to a 10x–100x throughput improvement over the SoA. The EPIC concept and methodology is shaped by the key finding that routine progress in silicon technology in the next decade will not be sufficient to allow FEC implementations to break the Tb/s barrier; Tb/s FEC will require not only help from silicon technology but also major innovations in FEC algorithm design and implementation domains. A key EPIC objective is therefore to develop and utilize a disruptive FEC design framework that considers the FEC algorithm design and corresponding silicon implementation architectures in a unified fashion. Through such an integrated approach, EPIC aims to advance state-of-the-art FEC schemes (mainly Turbo, LDPC and Polar codes) to obtain the principal channel codes for beyond-5G (B5G) use-cases. Top-performing solutions developed under EPIC will be validated by virtual silicon tape-out implementations, thus providing first-in-class FEC blocks of wireless Tb/s technology. EPIC aims at utmost scientific excellence and leadership position in the FEC domain, contributing to European research and development, ensured by measurable and impactful scientific publications in leading journals/magazines in the FEC research area. EPIC will also contribute to the future of European research strength by organizing lectures and tutorials on FEC technology, targeting graduate students and post-graduate researchers. The EPIC concept comprises a technology roadmap, focusing on its SME partners, with the aim of converting fundamental research outcomes into market opportunities via technology IP generation and standardization contributions, ensured by IPR protection. The EPIC consortium, which includes the lead inventors and institutes in the FEC domain, dynamic SMEs, and impactful industry partners, is dedicated to successfully reaching these objectives.","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: NEVERMIND - NEurobehavioural predictiVE and peRsonalised Modelling of depressIve symptoms duriNg primary somatic Diseases with ICT-enabled self-management procedures Abstract: Personal health systems for the management of chronic diseases have seen giant leaps in development over recent years. These systems offer vital sign monitoring and therapy delivery at home, focusing on the primary physical disease conditions. However, they do not provide support for early mood assessment or psychological treatment and lack a real-time comprehensive assessment of the patient’s mental status. 
Depression is the third leading contributor to global diseases, and depressive mood state is also considered to be strictly related to the onset or worsening of a severe primary somatic disease. Indeed effective preventive medicine related to the onset of depressive symptoms as a comorbidity and worsening factor of psychosomatic diseases such as myocardial infarction, leg-amputation, cancer, and kidney failure is lacking. 
NEVERMIND sets out to empower people who suffer from symptoms of depression related to a serious somatic disease by placing them at the center of their mental healthcare. Equipped with just a smartphone and a lightweight sensitized shirt, patients seeking care and treatment for their mental illnesses interact with these devices that collect data about their mental and physical health, to then get effective feedback. Lifestyle factors, i.e. diet, physical activity and sleep hygiene, play a significant mediating role in the development, progression and treatment of depression, and in NEVERMIND will be monitored by a real-time Decision Support System running locally on the patient’s smartphone, predicting the severity and onset of depressive symptoms, by processing physiological data, body movement, speech, and the recurrence of social interactions. The data will trigger a response encouraging the patient to conduct or alter activities or lifestyle to reduce the occurrence and severity of depressive symptoms. 
The final aim is to bring this system to the market, giving people the tools to control their depression and unburden their minds.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: AquaSpace - Ecosystem Approach to making Space for Aquaculture Abstract: The AquaSpace project has the goal of providing increased space for aquaculture to allow increased production. Following the call, we will achieve this by identifying the key constraints experienced by aquaculture development in a wide range of contexts and aquaculture types, taking into account all relevant factors and advised by a Reference User Group. We will then map these constraints against a wide variety of tools/methods that have already been developed in national and EU projects for spatial planning purposes, including some that have been designed specifically for aquaculture. In the freshwater sector only, we will also consider ecosystem services provided by aquaculture that are relevant to integrated catchment planning and management. At 16 case study sites having a variety of scales, aquaculture at different trophic levels with different environmental interactions and most importantly with a range of key space-related development constraints as defined by local stakeholders, we will assess appropriate tools using a common process so as to facilitate synthesis and comparison. This case study approach will generate a large amount of information and is allocated about a third of the project’s resources. The project will develop the outcomes leading to a set of evaluated tools for facilitating the aquaculture planning process by overcoming present constraints. This information will be presented on an interactive web-based platform with tailored entry points for specific user types (e.g. planners, farmers, public) to enable them to navigate to the tools most appropriate to their application. The knowledge and information gained during this process will be developed into an on-line module at Masters Level which will also be developed into a short CPD course aimed at aquaculture planning professionals. The public will be engaged by an innovative school video competition and a vehicle to ensure project legacy will be established.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: SONNET - Self-OrganizatioN towards reduced cost and eNergy per bit for future Emerging radio Technologies Abstract: A revelation in today´s mobile is networks is SON (Self-Organizing technology) technology, which is seen as a playing pivotal role towards reducing the management costs of networks. In legacy networks, still many network elements and associated parameters are manually configured. The associated operations costs are significant. Specialized expertise must be maintained to tune these network parameters, and the existing manual process is time-consuming and potentially error-prone. In addition, this manual tuning process inherently results in comparatively long delays in updating values in response to the often rapidly changing network topologies and operating conditions, resulting in sub-optimal network performance. SON is capable of collecting information from the network, so as to perform self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing and etc, so as to reduce the operation cost through less human involvement, and to optimize the service quality through robust and prompt network optimization.   

In this proposal, we aim to drive further cost savings in the way networks are managed today by amplifying further the coverage zone of SON within the network. We believe that key technologies such as network sharing and Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) can benefit from SON technology solutions. We will consider a complex context-aware heterogeneous network that is slowly becoming a 5G reality, and investigate the notion of SON CoMP and SO network sharing, as key technologies to reduce cost and energy per bit in legacy and future emerging mobile technologies.","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"

However, what is not well understood is the energy cost and carbon footprint of AI in future wireless networks. The danger is that intelligent networks are not green networks and that the recent progress made in green communication risk being undermined by the new breed of AI-based wireless communication.

"Title: FUDGE-5G - FUlly DisinteGrated private nEtworks for 5G verticals Abstract: FUDGE-5G aims to create a new generation of world leading 5G core network technology companies for private 5G networks based in Europe. FUDGE-5G will make a leap forward in realizing the notion of cloud-native 5G private networks by developing a further enhanced Service-Based Architecture (eSBA) for both control plane and user plane with “decomposed” players of the ecosystem divided into: New Radio (NR) access network infrastructure provider, eSBA platform provider, mobile 5G Core (5GC) provider, vertical application orchestration provider and vertical service provider. The forward-looking FUDGE-5G architecture will also feature “all-Ethernet” 5GLAN (Local Area Network), 5G-TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking), 5G-Multicast and intelligent vertical application orchestration features. The proposed framework enables highly customized cloud-native deployment of private 5G networks. FUDGE-5G will accelerate the (inevitable) shift to a fully software-based 5G core network by offering a disintegrated environment where components, both in control and user plane, can be deployed anywhere as micro-services (i.e., edge, on premises and cloud), being agnostic to the underlying infrastructure. This softwarization exposing 5G NR HW to third parties will enable the usage of off-the-shelf commodity HW to deliver additional cost savings, faster deployments and ultimately greater adoption for private networks. The consortium has been carefully built around several innovative high-tech small and medium European vendors for virtualized 5GC and service orchestration solutions and applications. They will be able to integrate, test and validate their 5G technical solutions over the premium end-to-end 5G NR facility provided by a major European MNO in several innovative use cases for private networks under real-life operational conditions with prominent vertical stakeholders.

"Title: KurdishWomen - From Kurdistan to Europe: Kurdish Literary, Artistic and Cultural Activism by Kurdish Women Intellectuals Abstract: Kurdish women have been involved in film production, radio broadcasts and exhibitions, as well as in the production of a substantial number of books, journals and other publications in both Kurdish and national languages of the European states. However, the aesthetic and intellectual production of Kurdish women, which leads to the empowerment of women and advancement of gender equality in the Kurdish diaspora, has not been the subject of any notable research yet. By going beyond stereotypical portrayals of Kurdish women, presented as either victim of honour-based violence or someone who suffers violent conflict, this research will deal with the gendered experiences of Kurdish diaspora from the four regions of Kurdistan (Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey) in terms of the growth of aesthetic, literary and cultural practices by migrant Kurdish women in five nation-states (Belgium, France, Sweden, Germany, UK) along with their impacts on larger societal debates within a comparative approach. It will also investigate the varying migrant incorporation regimes of selected European countries, including the impacts of the recent influx of Syrian Kurdish refugees. It includes ethnographic fieldwork, along with multi-sited research techniques carried out in the capitals of selected European states, data collection of both primary sources (creative, literary and cultural productions) and secondary sources (EU documents, annual progress reports, press releases). This study has a potential to encourage the maximization of networks of educational and intellectual revitalization in European states. It will also encourage other Kurdish migrant women to become factors of change and reach others. This is an interdisciplinary project aiming to fill in a significant gap in the relevant socio-political, gender, migration and cultural academic studies and policy debates within the European Research Area.

"Title: PATH - Plasma Antenna Technologies Abstract: PATH is intended to promote a collaborative researches focused in the development of high density plasma sources
implemented with the Exchange of staff personnel between the partners of the network. The research will also address
transfer of knowledge and training of the researchers in the specific field of plasma sources and its applications in the telecommunication sector.
High density plasma sources find large number of industrial applications from material treatment to Telecommunication. Overcoming the density limit of current source will open new frontier in several technological field.
PATH aims at cross linking different competences to study and develop prototype of plasma sources and plasma antenna based on hybrid technologies based on Radiofrequency and Hollow cathode technologies.
A Gaseous Plasma Antenna (GPA) is a plasma discharge confined in a dielectric tube that uses partially or fully ionized gas to generate and receive electromagnetic waves; GPAs are virtually “transparent” above the plasma frequency and become “invisible” when turned off. Unlike ordinary metallic antennas, GPAs and Plasma Antenna Arrays can be reconfigured electrically (rather than mechanically) with respect to impedance, frequency, bandwidth and directivity on time scales the order of microseconds or milliseconds. It is also possible to stack arrays of GPAs designed to operate at different frequencies. A Plasma Antenna will be able to: (i) identifying the direction of incoming signal, (ii) tracking and locating the antenna beam on the mobile/target, (iii) beam-steering while minimizing interferences.
Actual technology is based mainly on: (i) DC discharge, (ii) AC discharge, (iii) RF discharge, (iv) Microwaves, (v) Hollow cathode. Improvement of plasma source performances require a strong effort in term of modelling and technology. 
The aim of PATH is to merge European competences to make a substantial step toward innovative hybrid plasma sources.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: RAPID - Heterogeneous Secure Multi-level Remote Acceleration Service for Low-Power Integrated Systems and Devices Abstract: Many low-power devices such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks as well as several other embedded systems can't always cope with the increased demand for processing power, memory and storage required by modern applications in gaming, vision, security, robotics, aerospace, etc. As a result, most such applications are only executed on high-end servers.

RAPID tackles this challenge by taking advantage of high-performance accelerators and high-bandwidth networks. Following our approach, compute or storage intensive tasks are seamlessly offloaded from the low-power devices to more powerful heterogeneous accelerators, supporting multiple virtual CPUs and GPUs. We propose, for the first time, a secure unified model where almost any device or infrastructure, ranging from smartphone, notebook, laptop and desktop to private and public cloud can operate as an accelerated entity and/or as an accelerator serving other less powerful devices in a secure way.

RAPID offers a registration mechanism, which permits the accelerated entities to automatically find and connect to nearby accelerators with the required resources. Next, a runtime system, running on each such accelerated entity, takes into account several parameters such as the local status, the environmental conditions, the task requirements, and the status of the accelerators it is connected to in order to decide whether local tasks (or incoming tasks if the entity also acts as an accelerator) should be executed locally or remotely. Novel scheduling algorithms, admission control policies, Service Level Agreements and license policies are employed to serve multiple accelerated applications efficiently on heterogeneous cloud infrastructures.

An easy-to-use task-based programming model will be defined, while a novel runtime will automatically offload and execute the tasks transparently to the programmer. Within the RAPID project the first public acceleration cloud service will become available and commercially exploitable.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: NARRATIVENSCIENCE - Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives Abstract: The aim of this project is to understand the role of narrative in modern science. Narratives have appeared in many places in the human, social and natural sciences over the past two centuries. They can be found both in accounts of real situations and in simulations of virtual situations, in empirical work and in theorizing. It is clear that narratives have played important roles for scientists well beyond the simple act of reporting. Yet we lack an account of what kinds of thing scientists know from using narrative and how such ‘narrative knowing’ is constituted. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of medicine and evolutionary biology, even the study of those field narratives, as narratives, has been largely ignored by both historians of science and narrative scholars.
What do scientists gain from using narratives, what functions do narratives play? Initial research shows that scientists have used narratives to figure out what fits together with what, and to create coherence amongst the elements in their research.  But the means of such ordering vary - from site to site, and from science to science. Narratives used to explore a path dependent system in nineteenth century biology used a different mode of ordering both from the configuring narratives of mid-twentieth century case studies in sociology, and from the ‘how possibly’ narratives of modern computer-based simulations. Such variety requires a broad project, using many case studies to explore the critical role that scientists’ narratives have played in modern science. Making sense of such variety offers an ambitious challenge. But while there is surely no simple answer to why scientists use narratives, all these notions of narrative ordering do have something in common. They suggest that narratives function not just to describe and report as one might expect, they play a much more important role in answering scientists’s own questions and so - in various ways - in providing scientific explanations.","[""teleology""]"
"Title: ACTING-NOW - Algorithmic Containment of Threats in Graphs, Networks or Webs Abstract: The project is about the security of networks, and how to select the best containing actions to perform when a network is threatened. Network security is a major concern for Europe in the guise of at least three threats: attacks on computer networks and related infrastructure; diseases spreading in networks consisting of people, livestock, crops or wildlife; and the spread of fires in forests or buildings. The project brings together an experienced researcher with a successful track record in “the firefighter problem” (which models the general network security problem), a supervisor with complementary expertise and world-leading research record in multi-objective optimization, a host organization with expertise and leading research groups in (i) Security, (ii) Randomized, heuristic optimization (from theory to industrial exploitation) and (iii) Human-Computer Interaction. Two non-academic secondment partners strengthen this team still further, bringing in industry-scale optimization experience (Noesis Solutions), and a long track record of advising for fire safety to major infrastructure projects including to the military (Lee Anderson). The experienced researcher will use the training and mobility afforded by this complementary partnership to further the impact of his research on European security, benefit from skills training in industrial exploitation and on offering policy advice, and learn a range of additional academic and non-academic skills from participating in the training of young researchers. Scientific results of the project include new, effective computational methods achieving better results in practical applications mentioned above. Theoretical understanding of spreading emergencies in graphs will be useful in fundamental research in other fields, for example, in medicine in research aimed at utilizing the knowledge about contacts in the population for understanding how disease traits (such as the transmission rate and the infectious period) evolve.","[""telecommunications networks""]"
"Title: WORTECS - Wireless Optical/Radio TErabit Communications Abstract: 5G promises increased connectivity, high data rates, and ultimately new services. The first 5G release standard in 3GPP will be available by June 2018 with pre-commercial deployment in Korea soon after. Whilst 5G will meet current demand, the exponential rise in demand for wireless connectivity will ultimately require Tbps connectivity in indoor spaces. The future network will use an all optical fibre core, and an ultra-high data rate wireless ‘bridge’ to the User.

WORTECS focuses on the goal of ultra-high data rate wireless. High-frequency mm-wave (in the band above 90 GHz) radio communications will be combined with optical wireless communications in the infrared and visible regions of the optical spectrum, using novel heterogeneous networking concepts. A compelling virtual reality application will be used to showcase the capability of the WORTECS network. The project will deliver two Proof-of-Concept demonstrations. An ultra-high density LiFi/Radio network providing multi-Gbps to virtual reality terminals will be developed, and an ultra-high data rate Proof-of-Concept capable of Tbps networking will also be targeted.

"Title: SESAME - Small cEllS coordinAtion  for Multi-tenancy and  Edge services Abstract: SESAME targets innovations around three central elements in 5G: the placement of network intelligence and applications in the network edge through Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) and Edge Cloud Computing; the substantial evolution of the Small Cell concept, already mainstream in 4G but expected to deliver its full potential in the challenging high dense 5G scenarios; and the consolidation of multi-tenancy in communications infrastructures, allowing several operators/service providers to engage in new sharing models of both access capacity and edge computing capabilities. 

SESAME proposes the Cloud-Enabled Small Cell (CESC) concept, a new multi-operator enabled Small Cell that integrates a virtualised execution platform (i.e., the Light DC) for deploying Virtual Network Functions (NVFs), supporting powerful self-x management and executing novel applications and services inside the access network infrastructure. The Light DC will feature low-power processors and hardware accelerators for time critical operations and will build a high manageable clustered edge computing infrastructure. This approach will allow new stakeholders to dynamically enter the value chain by acting as 'host-neutral' providers in high traffic areas where densification of multiple networks is not practical. The optimal management of a CESC deployment is a key challenge of SESAME, for which new orchestration, NFV management, virtualisation of management views per tenant, self-x features and radio access management techniques will be developed.
 
After designing, specifying and developing the architecture and all the involved CESC modules, SESAME will culminate with a prototype with all functionalities for proving the concept in relevant use cases. Besides, CESC will be formulated consistently and synergistically with other 5G-PPP components through coordination with the corresponding projects.","[""5G"", ""4G""]"
"Title: Airport IQ - Situation-Aware Mobile Platform for Airport Collaborative Decision-Making Abstract: The economic costs of aircraft delays in Europe have been estimated at 1.25Bn Euros per year. Aircraft delays also result in environmental costs: aircraft holding or queuing with engines on, resulting in excess environmental emissions and air quality or noise impact, unnecessary ground movements and activation of auxiliary power units.
Airport IQ will develop a mobile information sharing system connecting back-end A-CDM systems with mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and other wearable devices) carried by ground staff. The system will provide the right information at the right place and time to the right people, making it easier for planners to make optimal use of resources. This will help reduce primary and reactionary delays, improve the reliability of estimates, and allow airlines to make smarter decisions about turnaround buffers, that will be shorter than before.  Airport IQ will also offer a simple way to simulate turnaround activities, making it possible to run operational exercises using the same mobile tools, which will simplify and improve the quality of training, as well as providing the basis for designing longer-term improvements in ground handling processes. 
The solution has the potential to create significant economic and environmental savings for the entire air transport value chain, as demonstrated by pilot trials  to be organized in 3 European airports (Lisboa, Heathrow and Targu Mures), involving real end-users (i.e. ground handling and other airport staff) using “live” onsite data.

"Title: ssmscaifa - The Making of Modernist Resistance, 1880-1950 Abstract: The vibrant diversity of an increasingly global modernity owes much to the cross-cultural exchanges between British and Indian modernists during their collaborations in civil rights, anti-colonial, and anti-fascist activism from the 1880s to the 1950s. The proposed project examines the shifting nature of literary and political contributions to activist movements made by four such networks of British and Indian modernists to illuminate their integral role in creating what I contend is a distinctively modernist resistance. As early as the 1880s, theosophists from Britain partnered with renowned Indian spiritualists to bridge cultural gaps between colonizer and colonized through shared mystical experiences to emphasize an innate unity among human beings. By 1919, however, the disillusionment following World War I coupled with India’s outrage about the Amritsar Massacre in which General Dyer and his troops opened fire killing hundreds of innocent Indians, supplanted such yearnings for unity with efforts to protect democratic freedoms from threats by right-wing extremists through a secular socialist resistance. Mulk Raj Anand, initially drawn to the liberal humanism of the Bloomsbury Group eventually joined the radical socialists of India’s Progressive Writers Association in 1936. Women like Sarojini Naidu and Virginia Woolf fought for women’s equality and opportunities to join in anti-right-wing resistance. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, influenced by the socialist ideologies of the Fabian Society, incorporated them into Indian nationalism and governance. This study explores the relationship between the ideologies of these networks to establish what the shift from spiritualism to secular socialist nationalism reveals about the nature of modernist resistance and the conditions of modernity that inspired it. The world view underpinning this resistance was integral in defining the post-war identities of Britain and India as secular socialist-leaning democracies.","[""radio and television""]"
"Title: SMARTWISE - Smart Miniaturized and Energy Autonomous Regional Aircraft Wireless Sensor Abstract: The objective of the proposed project is to develop a smart, miniaturized and energy autonomous wireless sensor platform dedicated to data collection for the Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS) of future multi mission regional aircrafts.
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in aircrafts requires data acquisition from various sensors distributed over the aircraft skin. Among them are strain, shock/acceleration, sound pressure, rotation and temperature sensors. Today such sensors are wired and installing many of them on aircrafts have a high negative impact on weight and wiring complexity. Thus it is believed that collecting data using smart, easy to install self-powered wireless sensors would strengthen the competitiveness of the European aviation industry by providing the much desired SHMS function with very limited impact on complexity and weight and greatly ease maintenance operations. 
Precisely, the SMARTWISE consortium ambitions to realise a self-powered versatile wireless sensor network platform dedicated to structural health monitoring with with specific objectives:
- The proposed concept shall reduce the weight of a comparable wired SHMS system by at least 60%.
- The prototype wireless sensors that will be delivered at the end of the project shall rely exclusively on self-generated energy (no pre-flight charging, cold start supported) and comply with the flight test regulations that will be agreed with the topic manager.
- With respect to comparable wired solutions, the proposed wireless SHM system shall expose a potential of 50% installation and maintenance costs reduction.
- The wireless SHM sensor network, including its power supply and on-board data processing parts shall cover 100% of the SHMS application requirements.
The partners have a long experience working together in Clean Sky and they propose a modular approach where a core wireless platform with advanced energy management can be interfaced to various sensors and energy harvesters.","[""radio technology""]"
"Title: EBODAC - Communication strategy and tools for optimizing the impact of Ebola vaccination deployment – Sofia ref.: 115847 Abstract: Communication strategy and tools for optimizing the impact of Ebola vaccination deployment.

The EBODAC consortium consists of 4 partners: Janssen (EFPIA), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), World Vision of Ireland and Grameen Foundation . These partners have experience and expertise in:

• (Ebola) vaccine development and vaccine acceptance; m-health deployments for disease management in resource limited settings (Janssen)
• Vaccine acceptance; risk management in health programs (LSHTM)
• Mobile health deployments for emergency assistance; communication and training delivery in emergency settings (World Vision)
• Mobile health software development and deployment in resource limited settings (Grameen)

As such, the EBODAC consortium is well placed to tackle the challenges associated with Ebola vaccine deployment, including:
• Stigma related to Ebola infections
• Lack of understanding and distrust versus vaccines in general in the local endemic communities
• Two step prime/booster regimen for Ebola vaccine: risk for a ‘no show’ for the booster shot, risk for presenting for the booster shot too early or too late; risk for a different person presenting for the booster shot vs. the prime shot
• People may be difficult to reach for the vaccine recall; People may live at a large distance from the health center where the vaccine is delivered
• Risk for data on vaccine coverage to be fragmented, not existing or incorrect

The EBODAC consortium is committed to deliver:
• A communication strategy that will optimize vaccine acceptance, supported by local anthropology research data
• A platform, based on mobile phone technology, for Ebola vaccine recalls, information/education on Ebola and vaccines in general; and tracking of vaccination coverage
• An identification tool to allow to match the identity of individuals in the prime and boost vaccine regimens
• A training program in the local setting, and a helpdesk function, to support the m-health platform","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: ALC - Aircraft Light Communication Abstract: The ambition of ALC is to show evidence that LiFi connection solutions can successfully address current RF transmission drawbacks and are mature enough to successfully operate connected devices in the highly demanding environment of a cockpit. The targeted breakthroughs to be reached are:
- Interfacing an existing LiFi module to the aircraft server
- Implementing the currently existing secure and robust LiFi connection used for offices into the severe environmental conditions of an aircraft
- Reducing current consumption of the connected devices, to save battery and increase autonomy.

As compared to currently implemented solutions (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth), ALC will demonstrate that LiFi is:
- Fully secure for data transmission with no possible threat of malevolent action
- Fully reliable with no risk of interference or propagation effects, fully compliant with normal conditions (e.g. sun or artificial lights, obstacles) and abnormal conditions (e.g. smoke) as well as  DO160-G compliant for power management 

The project will therefore deliver, test and validate up to TRL5 applications integrating LiFi communication with: 
1/ A flight crew wireless audio headset integrating LiFi connection
2/ An EFB tablet integrating LiFi connection to the A/C
3/ A connected headset, gathering health monitoring and behaviour/motion signals
4/ One or several other LiFi applications, to be identified by FACTEM, PURELIFI and XLIM, replacing existing wired connections, or providing new services or functions

For each application, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the proposed solution versus legacy wireless technology will be performed and quantitative and qualitative indicators will be used as TRL5 pass/fail criteria. 
The solutions will be standard solutions, i.e. not LiFi proprietary.","[""radio frequency"", ""bluetooth"", ""LiFi""]"
"Title: seQureNet - Secure information processing in quantum networks Abstract: The promise of future quantum computers to substantially speed up computations has been advertised widely since the early days of the field. But there is a novel and fundamental aspect of devices based on quantum-mechanical principles that has just started to be explored: Quantum computers can preserve the privacy of computations. This aspect is a distinct new advantage of quantum computers over their classical counterparts. An entire class of unprecedented computations becomes feasible, in which the user data and the whole computation remain perfectly private – a feature impossible to achieve with classical computers. The main focus of this project is to exploit this feature and to implement secure photonic quantum information processing in distributed quantum networks. These networks consist of clients and small-scale quantum computers connected by communication channels. Photons are chosen as they are the ideal carriers for sending information over long distances. The clients can securely delegate computations to the quantum computers, such that neither the data nor the computation is revealed to the computers or any potential eavesdropper. The project will, first, elucidate how quantum resources boost the security of classical computations; second, demonstrate secure quantum computations over long distances and study their verification; and third, examine practical security aspects of implementations. The research will leverage the experimental state-of-the-art by adapting new photonic quantum technologies such as integrated photon sources and waveguide quantum circuits. Moreover, highly-efficient superconducting detectors will be applied to achieve excellent quantum control of the photons. This research is highly innovative and will be pivotal in the researcher’s career development and for becoming an independent research group leader, as it enables acquiring both key scientific knowledge and developing complementary skills.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: 5GINFIRE - Evolving FIRE into a 5G-Oriented Experimental Playground for Vertical industries Abstract: Key industrial sectors e.g. automotive, are rapidly transformed by digital and communication technologies leading to the fourth industrial revolution. New ones are in the making, e.g. Smart Cities, which inspire a new breed of applications and services. The salient characteristic of these sectors, known as verticals, is that they are rapidly becoming open ecosystems built on top of common physical infrastructures and resources. This requires a high degree of technological convergence among vertical industries empowering them with enhanced technical capacity to trigger the development of new, innovative products, applications and services.

5G network infrastructures and embodied technologies are destined to “become a stakeholder driven, holistic environment for technical and business innovation integrating networking, computing and storage resources into one programmable and unified infrastructure”. It is this 5G vision that when it is further projected to accommodate verticals raises a number of technical issues Motivated by them, 5GinFIRE project aspires to address two interlinked questions:
- Q1: How such a holistic and unified environment should look like?
- Q2: How can 5GinFIRE host and integrate verticals and concurrently deal with reconciling their competing and opposing requirements?

Addressing these key questions, 5GinFIRE main technical objective is to build and operate an Open, and Extensible 5G NFV-based Reference (Open5G-NFV) ecosystem of Experimental Facilities that integrates existing FIRE facilities with new vertical-specific ones and enables experimentation of vertical industries.

In order to guarantee architectural and technological convergence the proposed environment will be built in alignment with on-going standardization and open source activities. Accordingly, the Open5G-NFV FIRE ecosystem may serve as the forerunner experimental playground wherein innovations may be proposed before they are ported to emerging “mainstream” 5G networks.","[""5G""]"
"Title: SINHOPSI - Single-Hole Pumping in Silicon Abstract: A globally consistent system of measurement units and reference standards is a necessary underpinning feature of most technological, industrial and economic activities. In fact, to perform measurements of physical quantities, record and compare them in a consistent way, systems of units and standards have been historically developed and agreed upon. However, in the last few decades, the ever-increasing need for stability and reliability has determined a shift from standards based on material artefacts or prototypes towards those based on physical phenomena and true constants of nature. The focus of this proposal is the development of a novel quantum technology to generate highly accurate electric currents directly linked to the elementary charge. This could serve as the practical implementation for a quantum-based standard for the SI unit ampere, which is a long-standing goal in electrical metrology. Semiconductor nano-scale charge pumps have been used in the last three decades to generate accurate electric currents by clocking the transport of single electrons with driving oscillators. The main limitation to the fidelity of the charge transfer is ultimately ascribable to the poor spatial confinement of electrons that produces errors during the pumping cycle. In this project silicon-based nanotechnology will be employed to realize and operate the world-first charge pump based on the transfer of single holes rather than electrons. A hole carries the positive equivalent of an elementary charge, but its effective mass can be significantly larger than the electron's. The resulting tightly confined charge carrier wavefunction is expected to provide significant benefits in suppressing pumping errors. The primary objectives will be to develop the underpinning technology to fabricate and operate the first single-hole pump, and experimentally assess its performances in comparison to the well-established electron-based technology.","[""radio frequency""]"

"Title: KoolZone - KoolZone- refrigeration control technology to minimise food waste, avoid food poisoning and minimise energy consumption Abstract: The respected environmentalist David Hawken recently assessed that better refrigerant management could reduce global CO2 emissions by 96t globally by 2050. Demand for refrigeration is growing, driven by developing countries and implementation of food safety legislation, e.g. HACCP. Better management of refrigeration is a clear part of better refrigerant management. Increased refrigeration and legislation is a proportionate response to the million food poisoning cases diagnosed annually in the UK, 500 of which result in death. Food temperature monitoring in commercial sectors is mandatory in the UK, EU, US, Far East & Australia, where HACCP compliance is used to safeguard food safety. The majority of food producers, handlers, caterers and retailerls uses manual records due to the high cost (€600 hardware only)  and complication of retrofitting automated logging or more efficient control. Many businesses over-cool to avoid bad press & litigation from ill customers, needlessly increasing energy consumption. The lack of 24/7 monitoring also leads to stock loss for food businesses. If a refrigeration unit fails out of hours, the operator will not know for several hours, meaning that stock is no longer fit for consumption.   
Our focus is to create a disruptive, very low cost (€7.50/month) complete refrigeration monitor and reporting system (inc. SaaS) for only €110 up front hardware cost. We have solved technical challenges around battery life, low-power electronics, enclosure design and antenna design. Our prototypes are genuine plug-and-play with zero on-site integration costs. They enable 24/7 refrigerator montiroing, plus a user portal with functionality to generate reports to satisfy HACCP inspections. This project seeks to scale-up our innovation, enhancing manufacturability and porting to scalable, secure communication and network protocols.","[""5G""]"

MAZI means “together” in Greek and MAZI [http://mazizone.eu] invests in this paradigm of technology-supported networking, as a means to bring closer together those living in physical proximity. Through an experienced interdisciplinary consortium, MAZI delivers a DIY networking toolkit that offers tools and guidelines for the easy deployment and customization of local networks and services. MAZI toolkit is designed to take advantage of particular characteristics of DIY networking: the de facto physical proximity between those connected; the increased privacy and autonomy; and the inclusive access. Such characteristics are used to promote information exchanges that can develop the location-based collective awareness, as a basis for fostering social cohesion, conviviality, knowledge sharing, and sustainable living. To achieve this objective, MAZI brings together partners from different disciplines: computer networks, urban planning and interdisciplinary studies, human-computer interaction, community informatics, and design research. These academic partners will collaborate closely with four community partners to ensure that MAZI toolkit benefits from the grounded experience of citizen engagement. MAZI draws from the diverse mix of competencies of its consortium to develop a transdisciplinary research framework, which will guide a series of long-term pilot studies in a range of environments, and enhanced by cross-fertilization events.

"Title: iBoard - Large scale interactive multi-touch displays Abstract: There is currently an established worldwide market worth annually more than $2 billion for interactive whiteboards. These whiteboards are mainly used in schools and other educational establishments. The end-users expect that a new generation of interactive whiteboards will support multi-touch finger input, yet current touch sensing solutions, while adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a large display, are striving to meet the technical specification for multi-touch interfaces. Our technology will disrupt this existing market. Alterix has invented a novel, highly efficient and low-cost electronic solution for measuring touch inputs.  By achieving a hundred-fold increase in the measurement speed compared to the touch interfaces commonly used in tablets and mobile phones, our technology scales easily to large displays with  diagonal sizes up to 250cm and is compatible with interactive whiteboards and flat-panel TVs. To serve the educational market the cost of interactive transparent TV display overlays must be reduced by replacing the indium – a critical raw material in short supply - which otherwise would be used to build the transparent sensor grid. To achieve this goal Alterix is transferring the inexpensive technology for making laminated ultrafine (nearly invisible) wires developed in the last decade for heating the windscreens of modern cars.  

It is now of strategic importance for Alterix to study the feasibility of establishing a functional supply chain, preferably within Germany and Portugal, for manufacturing TV display overlays and interactive whiteboards at the affordable cost point, validate possible issues with the manufacturing yields caused by novel aspects of the integration of large area electronics, and to articulate the company’s commercialisation plans. The outcomes of the project will help to establish a pilot production capability and to secure further investment in scaling up our business with possible support from Phase 2 funding.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: is3DMIMO - indoor small-cell Networks with 3D MIMO Array Antennas Abstract: It is predicted that wireless network traffic will increase 1000 times in the next decade. The exponential traffic growth is not uniform across geographical areas and mainly takes place in indoor hot spots. Hence, high capacity indoor venues represent the biggest network capacity increase challenge.

The recently emerged 3D MIMO technology provides a promising dimension to provide extra capacity gain in hot spots. In particular, the 3D deployment of small cells (SCs) equipped with 3D MIMO antenna arrays will take advantage of 3D distribution of user equipment (UE) in typical high capacity venues, and represents an excellent technical combination to address the indoor high capacity challenge. The 3D deployment of SCs with 3D MIMO antenna arrays faces technical challenges ranging from 3D MIMO antenna array design, performance evaluation, the lack of understanding of 3D MIMO SC network performance limits to the optimal 3D SC network deployment.

The is3DMIMO project aims to address these technical challenges by assembling a team of four partners in the UK, Sweden and China with complementary expertise. During the project, the is3DMIMO consortium aims to achieve the following objectives:
•	characterize and model indoor 3D MIMO channels for typical indoor environments;
•	develop a reliable OTA antenna characterization method for 3D MIMO SCs;
•	characterize OTA performance in laboratory conditions as compared to real-life 3D MIMO small cell scenarios;
•	obtain fundamental understanding of the network performance gains achievable by 3D SCs with 3D MIMO antenna arrays;
•	develop techniques for jointly optimizing the deployment locations of SC access points (APs) and their 3D MIMO configurations; and
•	provide 3D MIMO SC network planning and deployment guidelines for typical 3D indoor scenarios. 
The achievement of the above objectives will provide crucial inputs for multiple-antenna and 5G/B5G system design, and will increase network capacity in indoor hot spots by 20-30%.","[""5G""]"
"Title: Levitate - Levitation with localised tactile and audio feedback for mid-air interactions Abstract: ""This project will be the first to create, prototype and evaluate a radically new human-computer interaction paradigm that
empowers the unadorned user to reach into levitating matter, see it, feel it, manipulate it and hear it. Our users can interact
with the system in a walk-up-and-use manner without any user instrumentation.

As we are moving away from keyboards and mice to touch and touchless interactions, ironically, the main limit is the lack of
any physicality and co-located feedback. In this project, we propose a highly novel vision of bringing the physical interface to
the user in mid-air. In our vision, the computer can control the existence, form, and appearance of complex levitating objects
composed of """"levitating atoms"""". Users can reach into the levitating matter, feel it, manipulate it, and hear how they deform it
with all feedback originating from the levitating object's position in mid-air, as it would with objects in real life. This will
completely change how people use technology as it will be the first time that they can interact with technology in the same
way they would with real objects in their natural environment.

We will draw on our understanding of acoustics to implement all of the components in a radically new approach. In particular,
we will draw on ultrasound beam-forming and manipulation techniques to create acoustic forces that can levitate particles
and to provide directional audio cues. By using a phased array of ultrasound transducers, the team will create levitating
objects that can be individually controlled and at the same time create tactile feedback when the user manipulates these
levitating objects. We will then demonstrate that the levitating atoms can each become sound sources through the use of
parametric audio with our ultrasound array serving as the carrier of the audible sound. We will visually project onto the objects to create a rich multimodal display floating in space.""","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: RECENT - Ultra-Dense Unsupervised Heterogeneous Wireless Cloud Coded Networks for 5G/B5G Abstract: ""Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks will undoubtedly have greatly increased density and scale compared to current networks, resulting in massive interaction between nodes. It will be infeasible to provide fixed connections to all access nodes, and hence these networks will evolve towards a heterogeneous, multihop, self-organizing architecture. Moreover, for several significant B5G scenarios (such as vehicular networks in """"smart cities"""") the topology may be a priori unknown and rapidly time-variant: therefore, it will be impractical to provide a global coordinating authority, and hence these networks will be essentially unsupervised. (Security remains paramount, and physical security mechanisms especially appropriate.) The conventional networking paradigm will be severely limited by interference in these scenarios, greatly reducing efficiency. It has already been shown in both theory and practice that wireless physical-layer network coding (WPNC) is nevertheless capable of resolving this situation because it can allow relay nodes to extract useful information from all combined received signals, rather than treating them as deleterious interference. 
However, previous work on WPNC [1-5] has not addressed the case of large-scale, unsupervised, secure, dynamic networks. RECENT will address such networks starting with fundamental theory and technology, including information theory, network coded modulation (NCM) for WPNC, stochastic network theory, and physical layer security. The developed technologies will be deployed and validated in the system level simulator and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. Running in parallel to the technical activities, a rigorously crafted innovation management programme will assess business opportunities of RECENT technologies, taking into consideration standards and regulation, and hence ensure that they achieve their full industrial and societal impact.""","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"

This will help the pipeline operators to take preventive and corrective measures before any accident stemmed from pipeline failure occurs.  A low profile wireless Acoustic Emission (AE) and Long Range Ultrasonic (LRU) dual mode sensors will be permanently attached on the pipeline with a collar installed 100m apart from each other that can monitor 50m of pipeline in either side. The sensors will act in passive AE mode in normal operation and on detection of an anomaly will switch to LRU mode to locate and determine the characteristics of the anomaly. An artificial neural network (ANN) and data fusion system will intelligently manage data acquisition and analysis functions based on data received from the installed sensor nodes. An energy harvesting system will be developed to power the onsite electronics.

"Title: WARNTRAK - Rail track monitoring system - Wireless Autonomous On-Board System measuring vibration with continuous reporting to reduce maintenance costs and enhance reliability and safety. Abstract: Rail track monitoring system - real time information on track condition from vibration sensors on rolling stock to enhance safety, improve reliability and reduce costs.

Real time live condition monitoring of rail track is not currently available and this project will provide that capability.  This will deliver major benefits through cost reductions of rail track maintenance as well as improved train safety and operational reliability
. 
The technology capability, supported by the WiBRATE FP7 project, has been proven by 5,000 installations in three EU countries for rolling stock condition monitoring. The low cost self-contained wireless sensors are easily fitted in minutes, powered by Perpetuum's world leading vibration energy harvesters.

A prototype track monitoring system has demonstrated the new concept. WARNTRAK will deliver a fully functional system by further improvements, prototyping, testing and trials. This is a world leading capability with massive potential for worldwide sales and accelerated profitable growth through the clear benefits for rail operators. . 

WARNTRAK, using in-service train mounted sensors to measure track condition live and continuously rather than occasional data from measurement trains, will
- Identify degradation trends and rapid deterioration immediately
- Optimise track maintenance programmes by enabling early intervention and prioritisation
- Reduce the required frequency of measurement train passes, freeing up rail capacity and hence reducing the cost
- Improve track availability by prioritising engineering repairs before speed restrictions become necessary.
- Reduce damage to rolling stock and help prevent derailment by improving track condition
- Reduce resource use; energy, material and manpower.

The system can be fully implemented throughout Europe with no interoperability issues and exported worldwide. It will deliver the information collection, processing and visualisation tools to drive accurate track maintenance.","[""radio technology""]"
"Title: FreeATPOC - Towards an instrument-free future of molecular diagnostics at the point-of-care Abstract: Molecular diagnostics is still primarily a lab-based method. Emerging technologies for application at the point of care (POC) or need, i.e., where a patient or a sample is, have started gaining a big part of the molecular diagnostics market. Interestingly, available methods are divided in two groups: sophisticated instruments for ultra-sensitive temperature-regulated enzymatic amplification of nucleic acids and extremely simple paper-based immuno-diagnostic kits. Complexity, the main disadvantage of the former, results in their poor translation to several applications at the POC. Simplicity, often accompanied by failures, of the latter is the reason for their slow adoption even in resource limited areas. Our vision is an instrument-free approach that combines the advantages of both groups, i.e., a method that does not use heaters or modules that require electricity, infrastructure and maintenance, but, still, takes advantage of enzymatically-amplified nucleic acids detection. To achieve the above, novel diagnostic tools for genetic amplification based on ligases, polymerases and restriction enzymes operating at ambient temperature will be developed, combined with quantitative smartphone colorimetric/UV detection. The global applicability of the new approach will be demonstrated during infectious disease (Influenza and HIV) testing in human samples (blood and swabs) and plant pathogens (Xylella fastidiosa) in plant-tissues. In all cases, we aim for a time-to-result of less than 60 min, demonstrated sensitivities down to the clinically/field relevant values and a final cost in the order of $1 per assay. Combination of Free@POC concept with newly developed predictive models will expand its utility to monitoring disease outbreaks and their spreading. This new generation of instrument-free molecular diagnostics is expected to revolutionize nucleic acid analysis at the POC but also in applications beyond resulting in substantial societal as well as economic benefits.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: OHPF - Optimizing for Happiness in Personal Finance Abstract: In this project, we will (1) investigate the ability to use the log of emotional states captured with wearable trackers for improving affective forecasting abilities of people, (2) build a tool for managing personal finance that integrates prediction analytics, and (3) evaluate if accurate expectations about purchases increase happiness of individuals. 

Happiness and wealth are important metrics in our society with no simple relationship between them. One explanation for why money does not buy happiness is that individuals often have imprecise expectations about things they buy: imprecise forecasting of the nature, intensity and duration of an affective response derived from a purchase. Current technology enables people to track how money is spent to help take control of one’s personal finance, balancing income and expenses, and achieving financial goals. A similar trend is present in tracking of emotional well-being of people through novel wearable sensors emerging from the Quantified Self movement. This project harnesses these unique and timely developments in improving the positive impact wealth can have on happiness. We will improve the accuracy of affective forecasts about future purchases by keeping history of emotional states and associated spending, performing prediction analytics based on the collected data, and providing feedback about anticipated affective value of the purchases. Such a feedback is expected to remedy the biases in affective forecasting that people are prone to and can be integrated into the tools for managing personal finance.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: PACIFIC - Passive seismic techniques for environmentally friendly and cost efficient mineral exploration Abstract: ""The PACIFIC consortium will develop a new, low-cost and environmentally friendly tool for exploring for mineral deposits beneath the surface. The approach will build on the """"traditional"""" passive seismic method, which is capable of providing useful broad-brush background information about the geological and structural setting of mineralised regions, but lacks the resolution needed for reliable identification of ore bodies. Two radically new developments are planned; reflection passive seismics, which is appropriate from greenfields exploration, and the multi-array method, which will typically be deployed during drilling or in brownfields exploration. Both techniques have major advantages over current techniques, namely relatively low cost and minor impact on the environment. Through the participation of two mineral exploration companies in the project, the two techniques will be validated on test sites in Canada and Sweden, thus brought from TRL2 to TRL5. Research on social acceptance and public perception of risk for mining activities will accompany the deployment and testing of the techniques.
The PACIFIC consortium comprises a major university and a research institute who will develop the theoretical background and codes for data treatment, a mid-tier mining company and a junior exploration company who will provide logistic support and access to test sites, two small service companies who will conduct the surveys and analyse the data, a geological survey who will conduct research on public opinion, and a company who will manage the project. 
The PACIFIC project will thereby transfer the fruits of cutting-edge scientific research to industry and launch the development and deployment of new mineral exploration methods. This will enhance the competitiveness of the European mineral exploration industry, contribute to the discovery of new European ore deposits and decrease the dependence of European industry on imported mineral products.

"Title: ELIOT - Enhance Lighting for the Internet of Things Abstract: So far, the Internet of Things (IoT) is narrowband with no latency constraints. A wider range of applications is envisioned for industrial manufacturing, augmented reality and autonomous cars. It makes use of artificial intelligence, where compute functions will be offloaded from devices into the cloud. Accordingly, future IoT will need wireless links with high data rates, low latency and reliable connectivity despite the limited radio spectrum. Connected lighting is an interesting infrastructure for IoT services because it enables visible light communication (VLC), i.e. a wireless communication using unlicensed light spectrum. LED luminaires have enough modulation bandwidth for high data rates and each luminaire can be used as a wireless access point. Networked VLC-enhanced luminaires will add new features to build a wireless network for the IoT. ELIOT will start from existing prototypes and develop the support for IoT services. The project will integrate the lighting infrastructure with VLC and add positioning, multicast communications and enhanced security. ELIOT will demonstrate the new infrastructure in real environments at TRL ≥6 and mobile IoT devices at TRL ≥ 4. Main project goals are to provide an open reference architecture for the support of IoT in the lighting infrastructure, build consensus reflecting the best architectural choices, contribute to standardization of lighting and telecom infrastructures in IEC, IETF, IEEE and ITU-T and provide a roadmap for IoT until 2022 and beyond. ELIOT brings together Europe’s key players that cover the whole value chain, i.e. OSRAM, Philips Lighting and Tridonic as major component and luminaire makers, Maxlinear as chipmaker, NOKIA as a leading network vendor and integrator, BMW, Weidmüller and Thyssen Krupp working on industrial IoT, Deutsche Telekom and KPN as innovative operators, together with Fraunhofer HHI as a leading research institute and two top universities from Eindhoven and Oxford.","[""radio technology""]"

The EU has set out to play a leading role in developing 5G technologies by consolidating and building upon the most important research and innovation results attained in previous research programs. Nevertheless, 5G is still in its early research stages. Various issues must be resolved before it can become a reality: we need to join forces – across countries, continents, and sectors.

The objective of the TACTILENet project is to bring together the complementary expertise of European and third-country partners in order to lay the foundations for addressing basic issues in several facets of 5G networking. The cross-fertilization among partners will contribute to the ongoing research efforts by jointly identifying ambitious yet feasible goals for 5G system, addressing some of the fundamental research problems in achieving these goals, and finally, by designing and analyzing a suite of protocols. Given the size of our consortium and the timeframe of the project, we will focus on some of the most promising directions, such as network densification, energy efficiency/harvesting and short blocklength communications.

The consortium brings together expertise from all of the above research directions.  Each partner will bring along its expertise in different thrusts, and the project will develop a unifying framework for a systematic study of the Internet of Things within the 5G framework capturing these clearly interrelated research areas.

With its suggested mobility plan, the project aspires to strengthen collaboration among partners, exploit complementarities in expertise, educate young researchers and ultimately create a solid basis for fruitful cooperation, going beyond the time-frame of this project.","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"

"Title: SYMBIOPTIMA - Human-mimetic approach to the integrated monitoring, management and optimization of a symbiotic cluster of smart production units Abstract: Improvements of the overall sustainability of process industries from an economic, environmental and social point of view require the adoption of a new industrial symbiosis paradigm - the human-mimetic symbiosis - where critical resources (materials, energy, waste and by-products) are coordinated among multiple autonomous Production Units organized in industrial clusters.
SYMBIOPTIMA will improve European process industry efficiency levels by: (a) developing a cross-sectorial energy & resource management platform for intra- and inter-cluster streams, characterized by a holistic model for the definition, life-cycle assessment and business management of a human-mimetic symbiotic cluster. The platform multi-layer architecture integrates process optimization and demand response strategies for the synergetic optimization of energy and resources within the sectors and across value chains. (b) Developing extensive, multi-disciplinary, modular and “plug&play” monitoring and elaboration of all relevant information flows of the symbiotic cluster. (c) Integrating all thermal energy sources, flows and sinks of the cluster into a systemic unified vision, as nodes of smart thermal energy grid. (d) Taking into account disruptive increase of cross-sectorial re-use for particularly impacting waste streams, proposing advanced WASTE2RESOURCE initiatives for PET.
The development of such a holistic framework will pave the way for future cross-sectorial interactions and potentialities. Furthermore, the adoption of available LCSA and interoperability standards will grant easy upgradability of legacy devices and a large adoption by device producers. Modularity, extendibility and upgradability of all developed tools will improve scalability and make the SYMBIOPTIMA approach suitable both at small and large scale. Rapid transfer from lab-scale to testing at demonstration sites will be eased by the presence of industrial partners and end-users, as Bilfinger, Siemens, SXS, and Neo Group.","[""microwave technology"", ""radar""]"
"Title: SWAPOUT - Smart Wireless Access Point with Objective User-Targeting Abstract: The aim of the project is to refine and bring to market a ground-breaking wireless local area network (WLAN) product capable of: a trebling of useable range, an order of magnitude improvement in coverage area, similar improvements in quality of service, capacity and achievable user data rates, together with a <5m accuracy single access point based user geolocation capability which simply does not exist in the market today. This will generate a new revenue stream for the operator which is largely untapped at present, due to the poor resolution (~100m) of the cellular geolocation information available today.

These benefits will result in up to two-thirds fewer access points being needed to cover a given area, reducing the cost of a typical 100-unit outdoor installation from around €1.3M to under €0.5M and further, on-going, cost reductions (e.g. electricity, site rental, maintenance), plus a two-thirds reduction in carbon footprint.

The product achieves these aims through the use of a revolutionary, ultra-low cost, highly dynamic, energy steering system, targeting the radio energy and receiver gain accurately and exclusively at an individual user, when transmitting or receiving that user’s data, moving in a few nanoseconds to other uses, on a data-frame by frame basis. This system utilises standard access point chipsets and standard, low-cost, off-the-shelf, components throughout its design. 

The global enterprise WLAN access point market is around €24Bn today and is dominated by three major players (all US-based), none of which is currently innovating in the wireless aspects of the system.  

The aim of the feasibility assessment is to:  generate a business plan which can be used to seek further investment; to engage with customers in order to identify which of the many product benefits is most applicable to them; to locate partners with whom we could engage to form a Phase 2 consortium and to pull together such a proposal; and to formulate an IP strategy.","[""WiFi""]"

The main idea draws on formalising the logic of expressing (for the first time) the notions of cyber security and digital privacy by means of final formulas and fuse them into optimisation strategies to acquire the truly optimum defence recommendation in dynamic manner, i.e., with respect to the runtime changes of the telecommunications network environment. In this respect, SANCUS will dimension new inclusive Key Performance Indicator metric, namely, the security-vs-privacy-vs-reliability efficiency trade-off, for measuring the system network cybersecurity and privacy performance explicitly, flexibly, automatically and agnostically.

"Title: DAWN4IoE - Data Aware Wireless Networks for Internet of Everything Abstract: Whilst traffic demand is increasing exponentially, network operators’ revenue remains flat. There is an urgent for data driven 4G/5G networks.
 
In this project, we exploit heterogeneous big data analytics to optimize both the deployment and operations of wireless networks. We design protocols that enable future Data Aware Wireless Networks (DAWN) for enabling a new age of Internet of Everything (IoE). The proposal has been developed to address the following open issues in data driven flexible systems:
• How to characterize user mobility and wireless data traffic patterns 
• How to infer user Quality-of-Experience (QoE) from combining data sets
• How to use data analytics to assist cell planning
• How to use data driven techniques to optimise the network using Self-Organising-Network (SON) algorithms
• How to optimally cache data to accelerate and optimise data storage and transmission.

The research objectives of the DAWN4IoE project are as follows: 
• Develop appropriate spatial-temporal structured filters to combine different data sets and infer both human location/mobility and digital data demand patterns.
• Develop appropriate machine-learning techniques for unstructured natural language processing (NLP) to understand consumer experience for different service categories.
• Design algorithms to integrate the new data analytics techniques with current state-of-the-art deployment techniques to assist HetNet planning, performance prediction, and deployment
• Design mechanisms to integrate structured and unstructured data analytics to drive SON algorithms for radio resource management and smart antenna elements.
• Design algorithms to optimally cache data leveraging on mobile edge computing (MEC).

"Title: TEQ - Testing the Large-Scale Limit of Quantum Mechanics Abstract: Microscopic systems can be prepared in quantum configurations with no classical counterpart. Such a possibility seems precluded when the 'complexity' of the system grows towards the macroscopic domain: so far we have no evidence of non-classical behavior of the macroscopic world. Why is it so? How is quantumness lost as we abandon the microscopic domain? These questions, which remain to date largely unanswered, address interesting and challenging goals of modern research in physics, and serve the overarching goal of this project. TEQ will establish the large-scale limit of quantum mechanics by pursuing a novel research programme that aims at surpassing the current approach based on matter-wave interferometry. Specifically, the TEQ Consortium will
1) Trap an ad hoc manufactured nanocrystal in a radio-frequency ion trap, cooling it by optical parametric feedback, so as to let it operate in ultra-low noise environments. 
2) Determine quantitatively all the major sources of decoherence affecting the nanocrystal, and control them experimentally so as to prepare high-quality quantum states of its motional degrees of freedom. 
3) Analyse the light scattered by the nanocrystal to test the quantum predictions for the motion of the particle against those of spontaneous collapse and non-standard decoherence mechanisms, and thus pinpoint/rule-out key quantum-spoiling effects, beyond all the studies performed so far.
This roadmap will enable the test of quantum effects for systems whose mass is orders of magnitude larger than that employed in the most successful quantum experiments to date, thus closing the gap with the macroscopic world. Moreover, it will entail significant technological impact: the device that will be built will exhibit exquisite sensitivity to frequency and displacements, thus embodying a significant contribution of explicit technological nature to the design of quantum empowered metrological sensors.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: Constance - Flight Critical Wireless Slip Ring for Civil Tiltrotor Abstract: Slip rings for transferring power and data commonly form the interface between a rotating environment and a stationary domain. For aerospace applications, currently only conventional slip rings, with brushes, are on the market. The technique is proven, fairly reliable and robust, but there are clear drawbacks: wear, size and compromised signal integrity due to electrical noise.  
A few commercial wireless slip rings are now available, however not designed and certified for aerospace applications. Flight-critical applications in harsh environments require a fault-tolerant design. The future need for qualification has to be taken into account from the start of the development.
The call for proposal asks for the development of wireless slip rings for power and data transfer for a flight-critical application within the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR). This CfP is a technical and industrial challenge, which provides an opportunity for improving competitiveness on this important improvement part of the NGCTR program of the CS2 work plan.
For the development of Constance, NLR will combine their tiltrotor experience from the FP5 TILTAERO and FP7 NICETRIP programs with their patented wireless slip ring design and knowledge from the Contra-Rotating Open Rotor project of the CS2 Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft program. The distinguishing feature of the Constance slip ring is the specific orientation of the rotor and stator parts of the contactless slip ring which makes the design mechanically robust, safe and fault tolerant up to high rotational speeds. For the extension towards the flight-critical application on the tiltrotor the expertise of DDC Electronics Ltd. on power converters will be fully incorporated into the proven technology.

The unique concept is being developed in the context of Mudlark’s world-leading digital public transport game, Chromaroma, which turns all swipes of a player’s London travel smartcard into gameplays and achievements, promoting sustainable transport use by encouraging non-rush hour travel.
The advent and increasing accuracy of geolocation data harnessed with the prevalence of powerful personal mobile devices means we use OTR to make the individual traveller a transport integrator.  We can build a platform that attracts these solo integrators and retains them by improving their travel experience, at the same time capturing individual journey data. That platform can then flip the transport integration problem by addressing it from the user level up.
By combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into an innovative, disruptive and competitive solution, we will enhance the profitability and growth performance of Mudlark (an SME). We need the funding from this grant to help seize the European and global business opportunity. 
As well furthering our understanding the commercial case, our project objectives are to:
● Discover and understand the user needs. This will culminate in a framework and design scoping document.
● Test initial technical and tracking assumptions with an end-user group.
● Design the user experience and game using screen and paper prototypes. 
● Produce a detailed report, game design document and business planning roadmap.
We will conduct a variety of analyses to confirm the viability of our game and justify further external investment, specifically 
Phase 2 funding from this programme.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: GrassrootWavelengths - Grassroot Wavelengths: Highly Networked Grassroots Community Radio through a scalable digital platform Abstract: The Grassroot Wavelengths project will create a game changing network of inclusive digital platforms for citizen engagement, community deliberation, and the free flow of information within, into, and out of discrete geographic communities by piloting solutions for connected, inexpensive, community owned and operated radio across Europe. Our approach includes features of the Living Lab and Participatory Design methods for setting up stations and services and understanding the processes in which they will be used and appropriated, along with an emphasis on synthetic speech to support the curation of audio content, thus turning data into media. Building on the success of the existing RootIO platform – with its proven commons-oriented technology and catalytic capacities for promoting/enabling collective awareness and action, participatory innovation, community resilience, and media pluralism – we will: 1) deploy and test a network of low-power community radio stations in Ireland, Portugal, and Romania; 2) work with community groups, journalists, and public good experts to develop a robust platform for expansion across Europe; 3) enhance use and accessibility of networked community radio through text-to-speech, community oriented programming applications, and other community-supported modes for contributing and managing content); and 4) work within the EU framework to establish a public support infrastructure for local ownership and revenue generation. Together, these four actions combine to form a robust and tested platform with a clear path to scaling and exploitation in Europe and beyond.","[""radio and television""]"
"Title: Phasor - The World's first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile, phased array antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move Abstract: The demand for mobile communications is growing at  compound rate CAGR of 61% p.a. and forecast to do so beyond 2022. Global mobile data traffic grew 81 % in 2013 and reached 1.5 Exabyte’s per month at the end of 2013, up from 820 petabytes per month at the end of 2012. Users now demand fast and affordable connectivity when and wherever they are. The growing use/ownership of laptops, tablet computers and larger smart phones has also led to an increasing demand for high quality content such as HD video on the move. 

Current satellite communications antennas cannot fully meet this large and growing need: Mechanically steerable antennas which are bulky, heavy, require maintenance and pose considerable vehicle integration challenges. Phased arrays based on military technology are too costly for commercial applications. Existing low cost antennas trade-off the cost of the antenna against the requirement for much more expensive satellite bandwidth per Mbps transmitted. Their performance is also too limited for use in certain geographical areas (particularly at large skew angles).  

The overall objective of this project therefore is to successfully refine and scale up for market readiness the world’s first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile phased antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move. This will enable us to gain a substantial market share in the € 1.185bn Broadband Satellite Communications-on-the-Move (COTM) market and the associated antenna market which amounts to €0.39bn. Both of which are growing rapidly. We predict that we can achieve a 2.5% market share by 2020, generating total revenues of €134m and a cumulative EBITDA of €63m, creating 781 jobs. Our prototype system technology is demonstrated and proven in a relevant environment and at TRL6. This project will allow us to demonstrate the market disruptive system in an operational environment and then fully scale up the system to market readiness.","[""telecommunications""]"

"Title: BeSec - Beyond the Secular: Narrativizing religious change in contemporary German novels Abstract: The death of God and the disenchantment of the world are central to self-presentations of modernity. At the dawn of the third millennium, however, the worldwide growth of religious fundamentalisms as well as the pluralisation and individualization (but not the disappearance) of faith in the West suggest the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relation between secularity, modernity and religion. This is not only a matter for empirical research in Social, Political and Religious Studies. “Modernity,” “secularity” and “religion” are, in important ways, interpretive categories shaped by cultural narratives through which individuals and societies understand their world. The project “Beyond the Secular” studies a defined corpus of such narratives: contemporary German-language novels which articulate non-secular and religious experiences and worldviews. Through an interdisciplinary methodology combining close reading and narratological analysis with contextual readings in religious sociology, theology, and political philosophy, the project seeks to determine the potential of literature for the perception and narrativization of religious change in late modern societies.","[""teleology""]"

"Title: TrustVehicle - Improved trustworthiness and weather-independence of conditional automated vehicles in mixed traffic scenarios Abstract: Automated driving can be implemented with relatively simple controllers if the current location of the ego vehicle and the current and future locations of other road users are known without uncertainty. However, this is not going to happen in the initial stages of the introduction of automated driving systems into the market. As a consequence, system and human driver uncertainty pose a significant challenge in the development of trustable and fault-tolerant automated driving controllers, especially for conditional automation (SAE level 3) in mixed traffic scenarios. The TrustVehicle consortium brings together participants from the whole vehicle value chain to enhance safety and user-friendliness of level 3 automated driving systems. The main objectives are: (i) the systematic identification of critical road scenarios based on in-depth analysis of possible traffic situations and human behaviour; (ii) the setup of new tools for the cost- and time-effective assessment of driver-in/off-the-loop situations; (iii) design of controllers and sensor fusion systems capable of dealing with complex, uncertain and variable road scenarios to enhance road safety; (iv) the implementation of intuitive human-machine interfaces for the safe management of the transition phases taking into account user acceptance and gender-specific aspects; and (iv) the establishment of an adaptive and agile vehicle validation based on self-diagnostics and data logging to steadily extend the list of relevant scenarios and test cases. The outputs of the TrustVehicle project will be extensively assessed in real-world operating conditions on four demonstrators representing four vehicle classes. End users of the technology will systematically and thoroughly express their requirements, expectations, and concerns during the consortium activity. Special focus will be put on the demonstration of the fault-tolerant and fail-operational system behaviour at any time and for different kinds of weather conditions.","[""radar""]"

"Title: Loc8torHC - A disruptive healthcare monitoring solution that by nature of what and how it monitors (IoT) improves home safety, user wellbeing and provides early warning to help avoid critical admissions Abstract: Caring of ageing population will be one of the greatest challenges during this century. Most elderly people want to remain independent in their own homes for as long as possible. This decision can cause their children to worry about their parents’ wellbeing. This is when technology enabled care services (TECS), such as telecare and telehealth, provides a solution. TECS revenues in the EU28+2 countries reached an estimated €1.89 billion in 2013. 

To cope with this demand, next-generation telecare and tele-health platforms need to be enriched with innovative products. However, current monitoring devices for the elderly, can be divided into two types. The first is nothing more than a panic button connected to a 24-hour emergency telephone operator. It does little, costs a lot, and results in a lot of false alarms. The second kind is an incredibly complex, medical device that is beyond most seniors’ (and carers’) understanding which prevents mass market adoption. 

Loc8tor HealthCare (Loc8torHC), a disruptive, cost effective, scalable TECS platform targeted at the retail market. The core platform will be simple and work out of the box with no installation. Meanwhile, the carer can go online and configure the type of information they want the platform to send them, how often they want to receive updates, and whether they want updates in an e-mail, text message, or some other format.

The core product will include 6 core services; location, wander, fall, panic, activity and temperature in one device. Our competitive advantage is that our platform can easily be configured for numerous applications by adding 3rd party devices (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) through a plug and play Bluetooth port. The data collected from the medical sensors, combined with daily activity patterns (core Loc8torHC tags), and any other data sources (weather, pollution etc.) will be processed through our algorithm to generate a recommended diagnostic output in real time.","[""bluetooth""]"

This third phase of implementing the FPA is proposed to last 48 months and is a natural continuation of the work in GN4-2, building on the results and maintaining the overall objective of helping to raise European research to the next level, promoting scientific excellence, access and re-use of research data. 
GÉANT’s world-class, high-speed backbone provides seamless and secure connectivity with 42 National Research and Education Networks (NRENs), reaching over 50 million users in 10,000 institutions across Europe, and more than 100 countries worldwide through links with other regions. The core backbone is capable of multiple 100 Gbps transmission over each fibre link, and Terabit connectivity can be achieved by a single node. The safe and rapid connection of users to each other, to the increasing amounts of data generated by research, and to the high-performance computing capacity required by collaborative research form the foundation of the GÉANT partnership.
GÉANT services offer convenient, fast and reliable access to European High Performance Computing facilities, cloud services for the research and education community, access to scientific data and publications and other services from the European e-infrastructure providers, whenever and wherever needed. 
The structure of the present proposal emphasises updating existing services in line with requirements of the user community. This complements the proposed companion project GN4-3N, an ambitious programme increasing the footprint of the backbone network at the same time as improving its capacity, resilience and flexibility with the aim of offering 100Gbps network access to many more GÉANT partners and significantly diminish the digital divide.","[""data networks""]"
"Title: NEMF21 - Noisy Electromagnetic Fields - A Technological Platform for Chip-to-Chip Communication in the 21st Century Abstract: Wireless Chip-to-Chip (C2C) communication and wireless links between printed circuit boards operating as Multiple Input Multiple Output devices need to become dominant features of future generations of integrated circuits and chip architectures. They will be able to overcome the information bottleneck due to wired connections and will lead the semiconductor industry into a new More-Than-Moore era. Designing the architecture of these wireless C2C networks is, however, impossible today based on standard engineering design tools. Efficient modelling strategies for describing noisy electromagnetic fields in complex environments are necessary for developing these new chip architectures and wireless interconnectors. Device modelling and chip optimization procedures need to be based on the underlying physics for determining the electromagnetic fields, the noise models and complex interference pattern. In addition, they need to take into account input signals of modern communication systems being modulated, coded, noisy and eventually disturbed by other signals and thus extremely complex. 
Recent advances both in electrical engineering and mathematical physics make it possible to deliver the breakthroughs necessary to enable this future emerging wireless C2C technology by creating a revolutionary electromagnetic field simulation toolbox. Increasingly sophisticated physical models of wireless interconnects and associated signal processing strategies and new insight into wave modelling in complex environments based on dynamical systems theory and random matrix theory make it possible to envisage wireless communication on a chip level. This opens up completely new pathways for chip design, for carrier frequency ranges as well as for energy efficiency and miniaturisation, which will shape the electronic consumer market in the 21st century.","[""radio technology""]"
"Title: DEDICAT 6G - Dynamic coverage Extension and Distributed Intelligence for human Centric applications with assured security, privacy and trust: from 5G to 6G Abstract: In future 6G wireless networks, it is imperative to support more dynamic resourcing and connectivity to improve adaptability, performance, and trustworthiness in the presence of emerging human-centric services with heterogeneous computation needs. DEDICAT 6G aims to develop  a smart connectivity platform using artificial intelligence and blockchain techniques that will enable 6G networks to combine the existing communication infrastructure with novel distribution  of intelligence (data, computation and storage) at the edge to allow not only flexible, but also energy efficient realisation of the envisaged real-time experience. DEDICAT 6G takes the next vital step beyond 5G by addressing techniques for achieving and maintaining an efficient dynamic connectivity and intelligent placement of computation in the mobile network. In addition, the proposal targets the design and development of mechanisms for dynamic coverage extension through the exploitation of novel terminals and mobile client nodes, e.g., smart connected cars, robots and drones. DEDICAT also addresses security, privacy and trust assurance especially for mobile edge services and enablers for novel interaction between humans and digital systems.  The aim is to achieve (i) more efficient use of resources; (ii) reduction of latency, response time, and energy consumption; (iii) reduction of operational and capital expenditures; and (iv) reinforcement of security, privacy and trust. DEDICAT 6G will focus on four use cases: Smart warehousing, Enhanced experiences, Public Safety and Smart Highway. The use cases will pilot the developed solutions via simulations and demonstrations in laboratory environments, and larger field evaluations exploiting various assets and testing facilities. The results are expected to show significant improvements in terms of intelligent network load balancing and resource allocation, extended connectivity, enhanced security, privacy and trust and human-machine interactions.","[""5G""]"
"Title: TERAPOD - Terahertz based Ultra High Bandwidth Wireless Access Networks Abstract: The saturation of wireless spectrum access is leading to innovations in areas such as spectrum resource usage. It is widely thought however that the low hanging fruits of innovation for wireless communication are all but exploited with only marginal gains possible. For a real step change towards the coveted 1Tbps wireless transmission, new areas of the spectrum must be utilized. Recent breakthroughs in terahertz systems are overturning the “Terahertz gap” stigma associated with the previously difficult to access spectrum. With the emergence of viable THz communications systems on the horizon, it is crucial to develop a technology roadmap for THz communication for beyond the 5G timeframe. 
The aim TERAPOD is to investigate and demonstrate the feasability of ultra high bandwidth wireless access networks operating in the Terahertz band. The project will focus on end to end demonstration of the THz wireless link within a Data Centre Proof of Concept deployment, while also investigating other use cases applicable to beyond 5G such as wireless personal area networks, wireless local area networks and high bandwidth broadcasting. The project seeks to bring THz communication a leap closer to industry uptake through leveraging recent advances in THz components, a thorough measurement and characterization study of components and devices, coupled with specification and validation of higher layer communication protocol specification.","[""5G"", ""radar""]"

"Title: Strength2Food - Strengthening European Food Chain Sustainability by Quality and Procurement Policy Abstract: Strength2Food is a 5-year, €6.9 million project to improve the effectiveness of EU food quality schemes (FQS), public sector food procurement (PSFP) and to stimulate Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC) through research, innovation and demonstration activities. Our 30-partner consortium representing 11 EU and 4 non-EU countries combines leading academic, communication, SME and stakeholder organisations to ensure a multi-actor approach. It will undertake case study-based quantitative research to measure economic, environmental and social impacts of FQS, PSFP and SFSC. The impact of PSFP policies on balanced nutrition in schools will also be assessed. Primary research will be complemented by advanced econometric analysis of existing datasets to determine impacts of FQS and SFSC participation on farm performance and survival, as well as understand price transmission and trade patterns. Consumer knowledge, confidence in, valuation and use of FQS labels and products will be assessed via cross-national survey, ethnographic and virtual supermarket-based research. Lessons from the research will be applied and verified in 6 pilot initiatives, focusing on less-developed and transition regions. These initiatives bring together academic and non-academic stakeholder partners in action research. The six pilot actions are: a school meals initiative to improve the nutritional outcomes and economic benefits for local agri-food producers; in-store trials (undertaken with a grocery retailer) to upscale sales of local produce; a scheme to stimulate a sustainable SFSC that adds value to the fishing community; and pilot actions to expand regional food labelling; increase sales of FQS products in non-traditional markers; and improve returns to local producers at food fairs and farmers’ markets (via a smartphone app).

"Title: RICHFIELDS - Research Infrastructure on Consumer Health and Food Intake using E-science with Linked Data Sharing Abstract: RICHFIELDS
Research Infrastructure on Consumer Health and Food Intake using E-science with Linked Data Sharing

There is growing interest in consumer health as related to food, behaviour and lifestyle determinants. However, data is fragmented, key information is lacking, and the resulting knowledge gap prohibits policy makers and companies to make effective public health nutrition strategies and reformulation of food products. Making “the healthy the easy choice” requires knowledge on the context of personal life style choices of EU-citizens. 
RICHFIELDS will design a world-class infrastructure for innovative research on healthy food choice, preparation and consumption of EU-citizens, closely linked to their behaviour and lifestyle. This unique RI will bridge the gap by linking the agri-food and nutrition-health domains and account for the regional and socio-economic diversity of the EU. The RI will be instrumental to produce a scientifically reliable, technically sound and socio-legally robust evidence-base that enables scientists to efficiently collect, unlock, connect and share research data of EU-citizens. 
Consumers are central to the design: they harbour crucial information, as they increasingly adopt mobile apps and tech-wear, get access to e-business data and even medical information. Collectively, such real-life-time data create new opportunities for research, by e.g., monitoring of food-behaviour providing personalized feedback.  For further testing, detailing and underpinning and theory-building,  interfaces will be created to distributed facilities for experimental research, e.g., virtual supermarkets. Further enrichment of data is achieved via interfaces with information systems for food and health.
The consumer-focus and the scientific evidence of RICHFIELDS will, via its services, be available to (a) EU-consumers and consumer platforms, (b) stakeholders along the food chain, and (c) policy actors in the agri-food and nutrition-health domain.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: TRACKSCAN - A practical, portable and robust scanning system using infrastructure inspection radar (IIR) for the investigation of rail track substructure, ballast and tunnel infrastructure Abstract: This is a feasibility study to enable the development of a novel portable radar system that provides a simple non-invasive mechanism for inspecting railway infrastructure. At present different techniques are needed to inspect the ballast, track substructure and tunnels. TRACKSCAN would undertake these activities and more through non-invasive inspection. Within Europe ballast inspection requires digging a trench or driving plastic lined steel tubes into ballast with a pneumatic hammer. This is obviously impractical, time consuming, labour intensive and can miss ballast fouling. TRACKSCAN inspects all ballast so that maintenance can be targeted and effective. The feasibility study proposed intends to verify the technological and practical aspects of the system and ensure the business concept is sound. The system is described in terms of what can be achieved the science behind it is retained as confidential, as permitted by the call. The penetrating radar system has a rotating antenna which allows 360 degrees inspection and in any plane, this means that unlike other ballast inspection systems in the US, the TRACKSCAN system can extend beyond the vehicle width. The TRACKSCAN system is innovative, unique and we believe has a large market potential. The areas of inspection include: ballast; sub-ballast including drainage systems; water pipes and utilities, tunnel linings and tunnel track systems and bridge surface structures.
There is already interest from infrastructure owners and maintenance organisations such as Turkish Railways (TCDD) who have indicated their support as potential user/customers and will identify their needs and define the future work within Phase 2. Phase 1 will investigate:
•	Technological and practical viability and science, technology and innovation required in Phase 2
•	Economic viability and market potential
•	User needs for the system 
•	IPR (patent) and licensing
•	Business models and partners for Phase 2 and production of the system.","[""radar""]"
"Title: ORIONAS - Lasercom-on-chip for next generation, high-speed satellite constelation interconnectivity Abstract: The satellite market experiences a paradigm shift with the rise of satellite constellations that are changing the satellite volume launched from now on. Under increasing capacity requirements, primes admit that lasercom is required to connect their constellations at high speeds not possible with RF equipment. This is shaping a unique opportunity for the penetration of optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) into a market that will only grow. The deal for OISLs is clear; low cost, size, weight and power consumption (C-SWAP), but the current tools and methods used to make OISL systems are fundamentally incompatible with this requirement and the jump to satellite lasercom is a jump to higher complexity. ORIONAS aims to provide the technology that will disrupt the way lasercom systems are designed, built and tested and hit the right C-SWAP targets. ORIONAS invests in monolithic integration within European BICMOS and InP foundries for cost-effective access to high performance technologies. Using its photonics BICMOS integration platform, ORIONAS will squeeze lasercom transceivers into a few mm^2 demonstrating modulator/driver electronic-photonic IC (ePIC) being >2 orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art space (SOTA) qualified modulators and receiver ePICs being 3 orders of magnitude smaller than conventional free space optics receivers used in current lasercom modems. ORIONAS will develop a Hi-rel packaging technology to deliver all-laser weldable, hermetic transceivers that will be 20 times faster and 16x times smaller than current SOTA lasercom systems and with power dissipation in the order of a few pJ/bit. Using InP integration ORIONAS will fabricate SOAs being 2 orders of magnitude smaller than current space qualified high power fiber amplifiers and >10x times more powerful than current commercial SOAs.

"Title: 5GRAIL - 5G for future RAILway mobile communication system Abstract: The Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) will be the 5G worldwide standard for railway operational communications, conforming to European regulation as well as responding to the needs and obligations of rail organisations outside of Europe. The work on functional & technical requirements, specification & standardisation in 3GPP as well as regarding harmonised spectrum solutions is currently led by UIC, in cooperation with the whole railway sector. A major challenge is the update by European Railway Agency of the Technical Specifications for Interoperability of Control Command and Signalling (CCS TSI) by the end of 2022 with a full description of FRMCS with respect to interoperability functions. Therefore, the 5GRAIL project aims to verify the first set of FRMCS specifications and standards (FRMCS V1) by developing and testing prototypes of the FRMCS ecosystem.

The validation of the latest available railway-relevant 5G specifications will be achieved through cross-border emulation trials covering significant portions of railway operational communication requirements and including the core technological innovations for rail expected from 5G release 16 and pre-release 17.

The project will first define functional tests and then work towards the development and evaluation of prototypes, for both on-board and infrastructure, including vital (ETCS, ATO) and essential (voice specific services, TCMS and video) applications. Prototypes will be then tested in simulated and real environments, with pilots in labs and in the field rolled out in various European sites (France, Hungary and Germany), to ensure compliancy and validation for FRMCS specifications, standards and performance, and consequently guarantee the time to market for FRMCS deployments, planned for 2025 as per European timeline.

The achievement of the overall project aim will be tackled through the accomplishment of two technical objectives: developing a sound source and amplification system representative of the high sound pressure generated by the CROR; developing and validating an enhanced accelerated fatigue prediction methodology framework to HCF life prediction of CFRP laminates used in the new aero-structures configurations in CROR environment.  

Concepts for the sound source and amplification system will be designed according to the specifications. The best concept will be demonstrated and validated and successively the system will be manufactured and delivered to Fraunhofer IBP. The development of the methodology framework for HCF prediction of CFRP materials will be achieved through extensive experimental testing, physical analysis and numerical FE modelling activities. Following on from existing approaches, the final outcome of the project will be an expanded methodology framework for HCF prediction of CFRP laminates able to take into account the influence of environmental conditions as well as the presence of frequency dependent phenomena (e.g self heating). The framework will consist of fatigue models based on fatigue master curves and shift as well as FE predictive models that can be used as virtual assessment tools for HCF performance of CFRP materials.

The immediate impact of the project will be providing the IADP’s Partners and the aerospace community with advanced testing capabilities to facilitate the design process and the structural integrity assessment of the new aero-structure configurations as result of the CROR integration in order to meet safety and certification requirements.","[""teleology""]"

The Copernicus era has created a new market with the massive amounts of satellite data that the ground segments of space systems receive serve to the market and governmental bodies. A physical/cyber-attack to their installations or communication networks, respectively, would cause debilitating impact on public safety and security of EU citizens and public authorities. A physical attack on a space ground segment makes the distribution of satellite data problematic and, on the other hand, a cyber-attack in its data storage, access and exchange affects not only the reliability of space data, but also their FAIR standards: findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Current approaches do not fully exploit the recent advances in surveillance mechanisms with robotic technologies and AI. 7SHIELD will be an integrated yet flexible and adaptable framework enabling the deployment of innovative services for cyber-physical protection of ground segments, such as e-fences, passive radars and laser technologies, multimedia AI technologies, that enhance their protection capabilities, while integrating or interoperating with existing protection solutions already deployed at their installations.

"Title: ALBORA - Next-generation navigation technologies for autonomous vehicles Abstract: One of the concepts that will drive the paradigm change in mobility is the Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV). Massive investments on the field and the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensors has moved relevant market uptakes for autonomous driving from 2035 to 2020. 
CAVs are equipped with a huge number of sensors that allow them to understand the environment and act accordingly. However, this technology is superfluous without knowing the location of the vehicle in real time. Technology used to position a mobile device on earth is known as Global Navigation Satellite System – GNSS (e.g. GPS or GALILEO). Despite it seems impossible, currently, there are not any GNSS solution that meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers for autonomous driving, due to: 1) excessive cost to be implemented at scale (low margin sector) 2) unavailability to provide location updates in real time under hostile GNSS conditions (e.g. urban canyons) and 3) lack of a reliability measure to detect when a location is not accurate enough. 
At Albora, we have built and patented the Albora Correlation Engine, which uses AI and, in particular, biologically inspired Deep Learning Networks to achieve the performance required by the sector. Moreover, our technology can be embedded on the electronics currently available on autonomous vehicles, allowing us to keep the costs extremely low (no additional HW required!)
To exploit our product, we plan to build SW packages of our algorithms and sell licenses through an easy to use API (SW company approach). This model is highly scalable and will allow us to tackle the huge market opportunity. In fact, SW will keep the largest market share for CAV, growing from €0.5 billion at 2015 to €25 billion in 2030. To this end, we need to assess the technical risks of migrating our code to more efficient programing languages, seek industrial partners to perform large pilots and fine-tune our business model using design thinking techniques.","[""WiFi""]"
"Title: SwiftV2X - Smart mmWave and MultiRATs for Multihop Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Abstract: The push for improved driving experience, including the ultimate goal of driverless vehicles, has fueled the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Connectivity is an important enabler for CAVs, as it allows for autonomous vehicles to directly participate in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) and make collective intelligent decisions. 5G mobile networks play an important role in providing vehicular connectivity as mobile networks support mobility by default. However, the density of vehicles is high in urban areas that poses challenges for the support from mobile networks. Deploying ultra-dense small cells using millimetre wave (mmWave) communication is one promising solution since ultra-dense small cells deployment addresses the network capacity and mmWave addresses the interference arisen from the dense deployment. However, due to the relatively narrow footprint of a mmWave beam, using mmWave communication for fast moving vehicles requires careful allocation to utilise its potential and avoid selfishness in radio resource usage. This project sets an ambitious goal of designing smart and dynamic algorithms to manage mmWave beam allocations in CAV environments. The project first investigates solely on the mmWave beam allocations and proposes smart algorithm using both traditional optimisation technique for benchmarking and modern machine learning algorithms for practical operation. It then studies the radio resource allocation under multi radio access technologies (multiRATs) that is the likely deployment setup before the full mmWave small cell networks become practical in the future. Finally, our study is extended to vehicle-to-vehicle communication using mmWave that can support delay sensitive message exchanges and range extension. As experimentation needs expensive infrastructure, the foreseen secondments offer partners without infrastructure on their premises to test their design on other partners that possess the infrastructure.","[""5G""]"
"Title: Wi-5 - What to do With the Wi-Fi Wild West Abstract: The last few years have witnessed a significant increase in the use of portable devices, especially smartphones and tablets thanks to their functionality, user-friendly interface, and affordable price. Most of these devices use Wi-Fi Access Points (AP) where possible, in addition to 3G/4G, to connect to the Internet due to its speed, maturity and efficiency. 

Given this demand, Wi-Fi is facing mounting issues of spectrum efficiency due to its utilisation of non-licensed frequency bands, so improvements continue to be added to standards in order to improve performance and adapt it to new demands. For example, as Wi-Fi saturation increases in areas, such as business centres, malls, campuses or even whole European cities, interference between these competing APs can begin to negatively impact users’ experience. At the same time, real-time interactive services have grown in popularity and are now used across a range of mobile devices. These share the same connection with “traditional” applications, such as e-mail and Web browsing, but are far more bandwidth intensive and require consistent network capacity to meet user Quality of Experience demands. 

In this context, Wi-5 Project (What to do With the Wi-Fi Wild West) proposes an architecture based on an integrated and coordinated set of smart solutions able to efficiently reduce interference between neighbouring APs and provide optimised connectivity for new and emerging services. Cooperating mechanisms will be integrated into Wi-Fi equipment at different layers of the protocol stack with the aim of meeting a demanding set of goals:

• Support seamless hand-over to improve user experience with real-time interactive services
• Develop new business models to optimise available Wi-Fi spectrum in urban areas, public spaces, and offices
• Integrate novel smart functionalities into APs to address radio spectrum congestion and current usage inefficiency, thus increasing global throughput and achieving energy savings","[""5G"", ""4G"", ""WiFi"", ""mobile phones""]"

"Title: 5G NORMA - 5G NOvel Radio Multiservice adaptive network Architecture Abstract: ""The key objective of 5G NORMA is to develop a conceptually novel, adaptive and future-proof 5G mobile network architecture. The architecture is enabling unprecedented levels of network customisability, ensuring stringent performance, security, cost and energy requirements to be met; as well as providing an API-driven architectural openness, fuelling economic growth through over-the-top innovation. With 5G NORMA, leading players in the mobile ecosystem aim to underpin Europe’s leadership position in 5G.
Relevant to strands """"Radio network architecture and technologies"""" and """"Convergence beyond last mile"""", the 5G NORMA architecture will provide the necessary adaptability able to efficiently handle the diverse requirements and traffic demand fluctuations resulting from heterogeneous and changing service portfolios. Not following the ‘one system fits all services’ paradigm of current architectures, 5G NORMA will allow for adapting the mechanisms executed for a given service to the specific service requirements, resulting in a novel service- and context-dependent adaptation of network functions paradigm.
The technical approach is based on the innovative concept of adaptive (de)composition and allocation of mobile network functions, which flexibly decomposes the mobile network functions and places the resulting functions in the most appropriate location. By doing so, access and core functions no longer (necessarily) reside in different locations, which is exploited to jointly optimize their operation when possible. The adaptability of the architecture is further strengthened by the innovative software-defined mobile network control and mobile multi-tenancy concepts, and underpinned by corroborating demonstrations.
5G NORMA will ensure economic sustainability of network operation and open opportunities for new players, while leveraging the efficiency of the architecture to do so in a cost- and energy- effective way.""","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: GREENSENSE - Sustainable, Wireless, Autonomous Nanocellulose-based Quantitative DoA Biosensing Platform Abstract: Paper-based printed electronics are new recyclable electronic devices with technical, economic and environmental advantages. Additionally, nanocellulose (NC) based printed electronics, produced mainly from wood pulp, offer better printability and performance than paper. Therefore, the integration of NC-based printed electronics and biosensors is a promising source of innovation in the biomedical industry. In GREENSENSE we propose the development of a sustainable NC-based biosensing platform for Drug-of-Abuse (DoA) analysis, that integrates high-added value printed electronic components (a new biosensor, an NFC communication system, an energy storage system and a display) with a silicon microchip to provide it with multi sensor data processing, autonomy and wireless communication and that is easy for the user to read.  The main goal of the project will be the use of NC as: substrate for the printed electronics, lamination film for the encapsulation of the final device and as active component in the formulation of functional inks (conductive, electrochemical, electrolyte and dielectric). In all cases the NC surface will be functionalized to be printable, with good barrier properties and compatible with the functional inks (bioactive, conductive, dielectric, electrochemical, electrochromic and electrolyte). Pilot lines and high throughput, high precision and cost-effective S2S screen-printing and ink-jet printing techniques will be used to produce materials and components at large-scale. Two types of DoA biosensing platforms to eradicate the consume of drugs among the society will be developed: a strip-based platform (2nd generation) that will be connected to a Smartphone and a strip+reader-based platform (3rd generation) that will also include a display. The final flexible and recyclable NC-based biosensing platform will be mass producible with ultra-low power consumption and, therefore, cost-effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly.","[""mobile phones"", ""radio technology""]"

"Title: 5GCAR - Fifth Generation Communication Automotive Research and innovation Abstract: There are two ongoing industrial trends, one in the mobile communications industry and one in the automotive industry, which are becoming interwoven and will jointly provide new capabilities and functionality for upcoming intelligent transport systems and future driving.

The automotive industry is on a path where vehicles are continuously becoming more aware of their environment, due to a permanent increase in various types of integrated sensors; at the same time the amount of automation in vehicles increases, which – with some intermediate steps – will eventually culminate in fully-automated driving without human intervention. Along this path, the amount of interactions increases, both in-between vehicles, as well as between vehicles and an increasingly intelligent road infrastructure. As a consequence, the significance and reliance on capable communication systems for vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication is becoming a key asset that combined with sensor-based technologies will enhance the performance of automated driving and increase further traffic safety.

On the other hand, the mobile communications industry has over the last 25 years connected more than 5 billion people and mobile phones have become part of our daily living. The next step in wireless connectivity is to connect all kinds of devices that can benefit from being connected, with a total of 28 billion connected devices predicted until 2021. It will support the transformation of industries on their journey of digitization. In this step, mobile communications has the ambition to explicitly target the communication needs of vertical industry with corresponding requirements being set for the standardization of 5G until 2020.

5GCAR brings together a strong consortium from the automotive industry and the mobile communications industry, to develop innovation at the intersection of those industrial sectors in order to support a fast, and successful path towards safer and more efficient future driving.","[""5G"", ""mobile phones"", ""mobile radio""]"
"Title: SPA4AstroQIT - Broadband Quantum-Limited Parametric Amplifier for Astronomy and Quantum Information Technology Abstract: The emerging technology of superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) can achieve quantum-limited sensitivity over broad bandwidth, by utilising the wave-mixing mechanism in a passive nonlinear transmission medium. They are compact, easy to fabricate with planar circuit technology, have ultra-low heat dissipation, and can be integrated directly with other detector circuits. Their performances are far superior to the state-of-the-art high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier, and they can operate from radio to THz frequencies. Therefore, they could potentially revolutionise almost every kind of microwave, millimetre (mm) and sub-millimetre (sub-mm) instrumentation: from observational astronomy to quantum information experiments. Their deployment as readout amplifiers could improve the heterodyne receiver sensitivity significantly, and enable the construction of large bolometric arrays. Their large bandwidth, high power handling and quantum-noise performance could have profound effect on quantum computing architecture, improve the fidelity to process hundreds of quantum bits (qubit). They can be used as front-end high frequency amplifiers operating at THz frequencies, which is hard to achieve with HEMT technology. In this proposal, I aim to develop: 1) ultra-broadband readout amplifiers for mm/sub-mm astronomical receivers and qubit experiments, which would enable the construction of large pixel-count system; 2) front-end amplifiers at mm frequencies for heterodyne receivers and B-mode Cosmic Microwave Background experiments; and 3) parametric frequency down-converter with positive conversion gain to replace Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) as ultra-low noise heterodyne mixer for large array application. The successful development of these programmes not only could transform the mm/sub-mm instrumentation in the future, but could also have huge impact on many other fields such as telecommunications, medical and quantum computing technology.","[""telecommunications""]"

"Title: HarvestAll - Development of multi-source micro energy harvesting power management devices Abstract: Many IoT market leaders incl. ARM Holdings (the world's leading semiconductor IP supplier) predict that the IoT will begin to free itself from battery power in 2018.  Without reducing the reliance on battery power, there is a significant roadblock in reaching trillions of devices. Future devices will need to be self-sufficient and operate without any battery swaps or any human intervention for decades. This will be made possible through harvesting of all the available ambient energy in the environment, for example:
Thermal energy associated with static and dynamic temperature differences;
Vibration energy e.g. from vehicles driving over a bridge or oil following through a pipe;
Light energy from indoor artificial lighting. 
For these predictions to be realised, the current roadblock is micro energy harvesting systems that can effectively capture all available energy using just one energy management device. The technical challenge is that these ambient energy sources have widely different electrical characteristics that must be managed e.g: photovoltaic and thermoelectric harvesters are low-voltage DC, resistive, “trickle” sources; electrodynamic harvesters are high-voltage, inductive, “pulsed” sources whilst piezoelectric harvesters are high-voltage AC, capacitive, “bursty” sources.
Trameto is a UK-based fabless semiconductor business that is focusing on bringing ‘HarvestAll’ to market. HarvestAll enables energy harvesting from any-single harvester type, many-identical harvesters and multiple-different harvester types. This functionality is not currently available in the market. This project will help us to: further strengthen our market understanding, formalise existing and build new relationships with partners across the energy harvesting ecosystem to develop our supply chain and routes to market. This project will take us closer to having an exploitable technology that will achieve an ROI of 13.9:1 through sales of our novel energy management chip.","[""bluetooth""]"
"Title: PreventIT - Early risk detection and prevention in ageing people by self-administered ICT-supported assessment and a behavioural change intervention delivered by use of smartphones and smartwatches Abstract: Lifestyle, disease and biology put older people at risk of functional decline, leading to falls, cognitive impairment, frailty, and negative consequences for quality of life. PreventIT will develop and test an ICT based mHealth System (iPAS) for the consumer market that 1) enables early identification of risk of age-related functional decline, and 2) engenders behavioural change in younger older adults in order to adopt a healthy, active lifestyle. We will use an integrated system of a smartphone/watch as frontend technology and a protected cloud-based solution for handling of personal data as backend technology. We will develop online instruments for risk-screening, complexity metrics, motivation for behavioural change, and a method for personalise exercise by phenotype, based on currently available big data sets. The ICT based intervention we develop is unique, delivered on a smartphone/watch with exercise integrated in daily life and a behaviour change programme. We will evaluate the role of technology and behavioural change theories in risk prevention by performing a multinational feasibility RCT to compare with the same intervention without use of technology and with practice as usual. Usability and feasibility will be in focus, and ageing people will be included in all phases of the project. At the end of the project all assessment and intervention components will be integrated into a personalised self-administered activity system, designed to empower ageing people to control their own health and function. A microsimulation health economics model will be developed to predict effects of our risk prevention intervention on carers and the health care system.

"Title: MUSMICRO - Causes and consequences of variation in the mammalian microbiota Abstract: The mammalian gut teems with a particularly dense and diverse microbial community, the composition of which varies widely among hosts. A large body of laboratory work suggests these communities provide important functions for the host – including nutrition, pathogen protection and immune development – but we know very little about what shapes the mammalian gut microbiota, and how it affects the host, in natural populations. 
A major barrier to progress is a lack of powerful investigative tools for most wild animal species. I will overcome this by studying a natural population of the species that has the best laboratory tools, and knowledge, for the mammalian microbiome: the house mouse. Specifically, I will set up a new wild house mouse system and use it to address three broad questions: 1) what drives natural variation in the gut microbiota? 2) does microbiota variation predict fitness traits in the wild? and, critically, 3) does microbiota variation causally affect fitness-relevant traits? To do this, I will pair detailed, longitudinal studies of wild mice with controlled experiments in the lab, making use of state-of-the-art tools for this species, including: (i) faecal transplant experiments with germ-free animals, to test the phenotypic impact of different wild mouse microbiotas (ii) high resolution genotyping methods and (iii) new radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology we have recently developed for monitoring wild rodent survival and behaviour.

"Title: i-PROGNOSIS - Intelligent Parkinson eaRly detectiOn Guiding NOvel Supportive InterventionS Abstract: Transition from healthy status to Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is vaguely tractable, since symptoms can be so subtle in the early stages that they go unnoticed. Lack of biomarkers and/or findings on routine MRI and CT scans, PD is left undiagnosed for years, gradually affecting the life of over 6.5 million of older adults (>55-60 yrs) worldwide, increasing the risk of their health deterioration. Epidemiological studies conclude that early intervention could have an inverse relation with the PD-related risks of progressive frailty, falls and emotional shift towards depression. Based on this evidence, the cardinal objective of i-PROGNOSIS is the development of (i) an ICT-based behavioural analysis approach for capturing, as early as possible, the PD symptoms appearance, and (ii) the application of ICT-based interventions countering identified risks. To achieve this, awareness initiatives will be employed, so as to construct i-PROGNOSIS community, targeting > 5000 older individuals within the duration of the project, in order to unobtrusively sense large scale behavioural data from its members, acquired from their natural use of mobile devices (smartphone/smartwatch). Ensuring anonymisation and secure Cloud archiving, i-PROGNOSIS will develop and employ advanced big data analytics and machine learning techniques, in a distributed and privacy aware fashion, so as to instantiate a PD Behavioural Model and construct reliable early PD symptoms detection alarms. To those identified and clinically validated as early stage PD patients, ICT-based interventions will be provided via the i-PROGNOSIS Intervention Platform, including: a) a Personalised Game Suite (ExerGames, DietaryGames, EmoGames, Handwriting/VoiceGames) for physical/emotional support, b) targeted nocturnal intervention to increase relaxation/sleep quality and c) assistive interventions for voice enhancement and gait rhythm guidance. In this way, i-PROGNOSIS will constructively contribute to active and healthy ageing.","[""mobile phones""]"

Operating at an industrially relevant scale (250kg/hour throughput) for over one year, we will validate this biofuel with domestic and industrial customers in Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. We will prepare sustainable and inclusive business plans to justify post project investment in large scale replication that will result in economic impact, and jobs across the region.
Our objectives will be to validate this superheated steam biomass processing as a viable and sustainable source of large scale, clean burning, secure and affordable energy across Southern Africa. We will confirm market acceptance and ensure that it creates greater value than the cost of harvesting and processing. Quantifying over five different market opportunities, we will create a plan for post project exploitation that will stimulate bush harvesting and reverse encroachment. This will lead to long term socio-economic and environmental benefit across the region.

"Title: COHERENT - Coordinated control and spectrum management for 5G heterogeneous radio access networks Abstract: The exponential growth of mobile traffic, drastically increasing of network complexity, and the strong need for inter-network coordination of wireless network resources call for breakthroughs in control, coordination and flexible spectrum management  in 5G heterogeneous radio access networks. The COHERENT project aims to address these problems by researching, developing and validating a novel control framework for future mobile networks. The key innovation of COHERENT is to develop a unified programmable control framework to coordinate the underlying heterogeneous mobile networks as a whole. The COHERENT control framework has two unique features to deal with the insufficiency of current control solutions for inter-network coordination. First, theories and methods to abstract the low layer network states and behaviors of different underlying mobile networks are developed, which provides a simplified but sufficient abstracted network view for network-wide control and resource coordination. Network abstraction will significantly reduce the signaling overhead, making scalable network-wide control solutions feasible, and enable more flexible spectrum management, which are key for the success of 5G networks. Second, based on the abstracted network view, common interfaces and software-development kits will be developed to enable programmability in controlling and coordinating heterogeneous mobile networks. The programmable control will provide operators a flexible and cost efficient way to implement new control functions and thus to support new services. The innovative impact of the COHERENT project is in enabling a unified control and coordination framework for heterogeneous mobile networks by combining innovative approaches on abstraction of low layers in underlying mobile networks, software defined networking, and flexible spectrum management.

Delayed maintenance impairs road safety and increases cost of intervention, vehicle operating costs, and emissions.
The CROWD4ROADS project combines trip sharing and crowd sensing initiatives to harness collective intelligence to contribute
to the solution of the sustainability issues of road passenger transport, by increasing the car occupancy rate and by
engaging drivers and passengers in road monitoring.
BlaBlaCar (http://blablacar.com/) is the largest trusted ride sharing community worldwide, with more than 10.000.000
members in 14 countries, while SmartRoadSense (http://smartroadsense.it/) is a crowd sensing system which makes use of
the accelerometers of car-mounted smartphones to estimate the roughness of the road surface.
The CROWD4ROADS platform establishes a synergistic relationship between BlaBlaCar and SmartRoadSense, exploiting the network effect which is inherent in both the initiatives, to provide a sizeable impact in terms of car occupancy rate, road
monitoring, and end-user engagement in road maintenance and transport sustainability.
Scalability issues will be addressed during the project both from a technical and from a social point of view. The approach
will be validated on representative large scale pilots, involving more than 1 million people and covering more than 1 million

"Title: BE-OI - Beyond EPICA - Oldest Ice Abstract: To better constrain the response of Earth’s climate system to continuing emissions, it is essential to turn to the past. A key advance would be to understand the transition in Earth’s climate response to changes in orbital forcing during the 'mid-Pleistocene transition' (900 to 1200 thousand years ago) and in particular the role of greenhouse gases. Unravelling such key linkages between the carbon cycle, ice sheets, atmosphere and ocean behaviour is vital for society to better design effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Only ice cores contain the unique and quantitative information about past climate forcing and atmospheric responses. But the ice providing essential evidence about past mechanisms of climate change more than 1 Ma ago required for our understanding of these changes (termed the “Oldest Ice” core), has not been found to date.
The consortium BEYOND EPICA – OLDEST ICE (BE-OI), formed by 14 European institutions, takes on this challenge to prepare the ground for obtaining 1.5 million year old ice from East Antarctica. BE-OI has the objectives to:

- select and evaluate the optimum drill site for the future “Oldest Ice” core project and establish a science and management plan for a future drilling;
- coordinate the technical and scientific planning to ensure the availability of the technical means to implement suitable drill systems and analytical methodologies for a future ice-core drilling, and of well-trained personnel to operate them successfully;
- establish the budget and the financial background for a future deep-drilling campaign;
- embed the scientific aims of an “Oldest Ice” core project within the wider paleoclimate data and modelling communities through international and cross-disciplinary cooperation.","[""radar""]"

"Title: MENTOR - Machine LEarning in Optical NeTwORks Abstract: Optical fiber networks is one of the major drivers of our societal progress and a key  enabler of the global telecommunication infrastructure. Optical networks underwent considerable changes over the past decade, as consequence of a continuous growth (exceeding 20% per year) of bandwidth demand.   The current growth sets strong requirements in terms of capacity and costs for the operators, which seek to decrease the cost per transmitted bit. Several solutions have been proposed, and among them wide-band is more favourable to network operators, compared to more/or novel fibers. However, wide-band optical system presents new major challenges: optical components must guarantee similar performance over a broad spectrum, network optimization is carried out on a non-flat spectrum and with a much larger number of channels making design, optimization and control a complex problem. Therefore, application of machine learning (ML) techniques is of the growing importance for high-capacity multi-band (MB) optical systems. ML is becoming the technique of choice to solve complex nonlinear technical problems, such as, advance component design and management of wide-band networks. 

The European Industrial Doctorate MENTOR presents a timely proposal to train 6 ESRs in the interdisciplinary field of high industrial importance: ML applications in multi-band optical communications. As ML can properly works only when a large amount of real data is available, it is crucial to bring together academic partners and the industry that provide access to the data. MENTOR consortium offers the strong industrial commitment of four large companies (CORIANT Germany and Portugal, ORANGE Labs and TELECOM ITALIA MOBILE) that significantly contributed in defining the research and training topics to be studied together with the world-leading academic partners in MENTOR. MENTOR will contribute to the European economy by design of the next generation of high-capacity optical networks.","[""optical networks""]"

"Title: TUNEMODE - TUNABLE MODE RANDOM FIBER LASER FOR MODE DIVISION MULTIPLEXING LASER SOURCE Abstract: The evolution of the bandwidth demand in optical fiber communication system in the Europe region keeps increasing year after year. As for now, most of these demands are supported by the WDM system of optical communication network. It is forecasted that this increasing bandwidth demand could not be supported any more data traffics in the future due to the consumption growth of new applications. In this regards, a new system for solving this issue is becoming all the necessary. An alternative which is forecasted to be able to fulfill this demand is Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM). MDM basically is based on a concept developed for increasing the optical data transmission capacity within the optical fiber itself. Thus, this project will be carried out to investigate the mode tuning of random fiber laser for the application in MDM system. The main objective of this project is to generate a laser with various modes which can be tuned by using few mode fiber and will be using random fiber laser. The purpose of using random fiber laser is because the conventional rare earth based fiber laser such as Erbium and Ytterbium are not optimized for lasing at higher order mode than the fundamental mode LP01. Investigation on mode tunability will be carried out using micro fiber technology and also fiber Bragg grating technology whereby the combination of these two technologies will be functioning as the tunable and filtering element. Also, in this project, new ideas and concepts will be developed whereby the generation of a laser with various modes will probably generate new concepts and findings, not only for MDM system, but also for the device to support this application in the future. In this regards, this research is very significant, in conjunction with the growth of the bandwidth demand in the Europe region as well as in the world.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: GHOST - Galileo EnHancement as BoOster of the Smart CiTies Abstract: With the increase of the density of people in urban areas, modern cities experience significant needs related to planning, maintenance and administration. As a result, many cities are engaged in massive investment for infrastructure development across many structural elements including water supply, lighting, maintenance, traffic and transportation systems, refuse disposal and all the factors which form a part of the completed city.

The public transportation systems, assisting the movement of people in urban areas using group travel technologies such as buses and trains, are continuously evolving in terms of areas coverage, comfort and technology. Such systems can be exploited by the cities in order to serve both public and benefits including:
• Maintenance of infrastructure such as lighting, road deteriorations etc.
• Inspection of points of interests such as parking spaces, garbage collection points etc.
• Provision of services to the private sector such as inspection of advertisement points etc.

The main objective of the GHOST project is to design, develop and validate at an operational environment a GALILEO-based intelligent system for vehicles in order to take advantage of the public transportation fleet routes, towards enabling development of new cross-functional applications for infrastructures maintenance, street parking and garbage management in smarter cities environment.

The GHOST intelligent system will be validated at an operational environment, by demonstrating and experimenting on three (3) use cases of the GHOST applications including:
• Reporting of street lighting anomalies or road deteriorations (ex: pothole).
• Detection of double parking or occupied parking reserved for disabled drivers by unauthorized vehicles.

"Title: PHASE-CHANGE SWITCH - Phase-Change Materials and Switches for Enabling Beyond-CMOS Energy Efficient Applications Abstract: The proposal PHASE-CHANGE SWITCH addresses the need for combined energy efficiency and extended functionality with the engineering of new classes of solid-state Beyond CMOS switches exploiting the abrupt phase-change (Metal-Insulator-Transition - MIT) in materials and at temperatures that make them interesting for electronic circuits and systems by their performance, energy efficiency and scalability. The proposal includes disruptive research contributions on the whole value chain, from novel phase-change materials to new device and circuit architectures together with their scaling and integration on silicon and GaN platforms. On materials alloying and straining techniques in phase-change systems are used for the engineering of the transition temperature and the ON and OFF bandgaps (conductivity) of VO2. A significant advance is the three-terminal energy efficient phase-change electronic switch with deep-sub-thermionic average slope (<10mV/decade at room temperature), operating at sub-0.5V voltage supply, with ON current better than silicon MOSFET and OFF current comparable with tunnel FETs, surpassing the state-of-the-art. 
The proposal focuses on smart design and exploitation of the unique properties of the phase-change VO2 beyond CMOS switches, by targeting with the same technology platform: (i) von-Neumann steep-slope logic devices and circuits, to extend CMOS with novel functionality and energy efficiency, (ii) uniquely reconfigurable energy efficient radio-frequency (RF) circuit functions from 1 to 100GHz, (iii) unconventional scalable neuristors exploiting the hysteretic RC switching behaviour for neuromorphic computation, and, (iv) disruptive classes of solid-state ionitronic devices for neuromorphic computation, exploiting non-volatile memory effects.

"Title: CORRELATION - Characterization and prediction of service-level traffic for future sliced mobile network Abstract: Network slicing is a key enabling technology for the 5th generation (5G) and beyond mobile networks. Network slicing allows the creation of multiple logical network instances on the same underlying physical network. Slices can then be formed or combined on-demand, with parameters optimized according to various service requirements so as to meet the users’ instant requests for specific mobile services. Hence, the performance of network slicing heavily depends on characterizing and predicting the spatial- temporal traffic patterns for individual services in near real-time. 

Research on characterization and prediction for service-level mobile traffic is still in nascence. Firstly, the traffic characteristics and predicting methods of individual services, especially the 5G services, have not been studied adequately. Secondly, traffic correlation among different services and the reasons behind it have not been well studied. Thirdly, inter-service correlations have not been well exploited in service-level mobile traffic prediction. 

In this project, we will address these gaps. Firstly, we will study the spatial-temporal characteristics of service-level traffic patterns at multi-scales, based on which, we will investigate the traffic predicting frameworks for individual services. Secondly, for the first time, we will investigate the traffic correlation among different services and try to discover the underlying reasons by analyzing the service usage profiles of different user groups. Finally, based on inter-service correlations, we will investigate whether we can improve service-level traffic prediction accuracy and whether we could execute prediction for diverse services according to the historical records of only a few key services.

The success of the CORRELATION project will make proactive network slicing possible, which will then drive proactive network optimisation for 5G and beyond mobile networks.","[""5G""]"
"Title: MICROBAT - Wireless devices for smart energy management systems Abstract: There is a growing need for smart energy-efficient homes, offices and industrial plants, and this need is increasingly being supported by legislation.  Hence there is a growing market for technologies to enable this, through the deployment of smart metering as well as intelligent heating, ventilation, lighting, and monitoring control systems.  To address this market, a new class of low-power wireless protocols has been developed for the automation and control of the above systems.
To date, wireless home and building automation systems that employ such protocols have seen limited adoption, despite the technology being widely available, mainly because conventional semiconductor radio architectures are unable to fulfill the market need of whole-house coverage and ultra-low power consumption while using inexpensive semiconductor technology.  
Cascoda's patented technology is unique in that it delivers standards-based radio communication with whole-house coverage, high data-link reliability and ultra-low power consumption, while using inexpensive CMOS semiconductor technology.
The objective of this project is to investigate the best fit for Cascoda’s technology with manufacturers energy management systems, and to develop an appropriate customer evaluation kit and a high-level protocol stack for the target application.  Together, these items will form a solution with which such manufacturers can quickly and easily integrate Cascoda’s technology.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: SURG-Africa - Scaling up Safe Surgery for District and Rural Populations in Africa Abstract: In sub-Saharan Africa 95% of the population has no access to surgical services. In this region surgery – a proven and often life-saving intervention – is only accessible to urban populations, with only one surgeon per 2.5 million people in rural areas. Emerging evidence demonstrates that major surgery can be undertaken safely and effectively at district hospitals, making it accessible to otherwise neglected rural populations. 

Objectives: Guided by a health systems-strengthening framework and a comprehensive programme of research, Scaling up Safe Surgery for District and Rural Populations in Africa will scale up the delivery of accessible, elective and emergency surgery at district hospitals to national level programmes in three African countries: Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania. 

How objectives will be achieved: SURG-Africa is a tested intervention, drawing lessons from two large-scale successful interventions coordinated by members of this SURG-Africa consortium (one FP7 EC funded) that have trained and supervised non-physician clinicians to deliver essential and emergency surgery in four African countries. Platformed on comprehensive surgical systems analyses, it will put in place national surgical information systems; and will test innovative interventions for making specialist supervision of district surgery feasible and affordable. Epidemiological, economics and implementation research will evaluate impact, and provide evidence for policymakers. 

SURG-Africa directly addresses all aspects of Topic SC1-PM-21-2016: Implementation research for scaling- up of evidence based innovations and good practice in Europe and low and middle-income countries. The results will be transferable and scalable national surgical systems models, with implications for national budget factored in, for making safe surgical services accessible, equitable and sustainable in Africa, especially for women in rural areas.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: IoRL - Internet of Radio Light Abstract: Wireless networks in buildings suffer from congestion, interference, security and safety concerns, restricted propagation and poor in-door location accuracy. The Internet of Radio-Light (IoRL) project develops a safer, more secure, customizable and intelligent building network that reliably delivers increased throughput (greater than 10Gbps) from access points pervasively located within buildings, whilst minimizing interference and harmful EM exposure and providing location accuracy of less than 10 cm. It thereby shows how to solve the problem of broadband wireless access in buildings and promotes the establishment of a global standard in ITU. Building landlords will be incentivized to find funding to realize this solution for their properties to increase their value resulting in a stimulated market for broadband networking products in buildings, benefiting society and stimulating the world Gross Domestic Product. IoRL project provides solutions to the two main barriers to develop this broadband networking solution in buildings because it: (i) Brings together a multi-disciplinary team of research institutions and industries in a collaborative project to develop and demonstrate this vision, who otherwise would not have assembled to achieve this goal; (ii) Develops a proof of concept demonstrator, which will act as the basis for standardization of a global solution. The starting point is the joint VLC demonstrator at Tsinghua University & ISEP, the mmWave at Cobham Wireless and the NFV/SDN at NCSR-Democratos. The challenges are to (i) Develop broadband communication solutions for buildings by integrating these technologies to exploit the pervasiveness and accessibility of the existing electric light access points, the broadband capacities of mmWave and VLC technologies and the flexibility of SDN/NFV; (ii) Industrially design a radio-light solution that can be integrated into the myriad of form factors of existing electric light systems and consumer products.","[""5G"", ""LiFi""]"
"Title: PJ18 4DTM - 4D Trajectory Management Abstract: One of the main obstacles of reaching Single European Sky’s objectives is management of flight trajectories. Inaccuracies are difficult to spot and information given to stakeholders about the trajectory is limited, arriving late, and full of inconsistencies and wrong assumptions. Military Flights are currently not integrated in the ATM-system, so demanding special treatment.

Additionally, there is a lack of complete, updated, unique and coherent aeronautical and meteorological information at European level, which again limits the accuracy of the predicted trajectory and so difficult detecting incoming issues and designing optimum solutions.

This project addresses solutions for the above limitations. Harmonized and global trajectory information sharing, including improved negotiation mechanisms, will enable significant operational benefits on flight management. The aim is to enable a unique and integrated view of all flights trajectories (including military ones) among the stakeholders. This is improved thanks to new tools and capabilities ensuring all stakeholders are managing a single, updated and complete view of the forecasted meteorology and airspace configuration.

Both solutions above will increase safety and efficiency - a very important step towards ensuring that anyone can fly safer, cheaper and quicker in Europe in 10 years.

As so many stakeholders are involved, this issue cannot be solved at national level. All stakeholders (mainly air navigation service providers, as well as air and ground industry partners) need to be involved as all will need to perform changes to ensure successful implementation. The SESAR 2020 Programme is the only place where this can happen.

In this project we have ensured participation of the major ATM stakeholders which ensures having the knowledge and expertise to come up with the concepts, prototypes and platforms to provide sustainable results usable throughout Europe.","[""radar""]"
"Title: SYNCHRO-NET - Synchro-modal Supply Chain Eco-Net Abstract: SYNCHRO-NET will demonstrate how a powerful and innovative SYNCHRO-modal supply chain eco-NET can catalyse the uptake of the slow steaming concept and synchro-modality, guaranteeing cost-effective robust solutions that de-stress the supply chain to reduce emissions and costs for logistics operations while simultaneously increasing reliability and service levels for logistics users.
The core of the SYNCHRO-NET solution will be an integrated optimisation and simulation eco-net, incorporating: real-time synchro-modal logistics optimisation (e-Freight-enabled);  slow steaming ship simulation & control systems; synchro-modal risk/benefit analysis statistical modelling; dynamic stakeholder impact assessment solution;  and a synchro-operability communications and governance architecture.
Perhaps the most important output of SYNCHRO-NET will be the demonstration that slow steaming, coupled with synchro-modal logistics optimisation delivers amazing benefits to all stakeholders in the supply chain: massive reduction in emissions for shipping and land-based transport due to modal shift to greener modes AND optimised planning processes leading to reduced empty kms for trucks and fewer wasted repositioning movements.
This will lead to lower costs for ALL stakeholders – shipping companies and logistics operators will benefit from massive reduction in fuel usage, faster turnaround times in ports & terminals and increased resource utilisation/efficiency. Customers and end users will have greater control of their supply chain, leading to more reliable replenishment activity and therefore reduced safety stocks and expensive warehousing. Authorities and governmental organisations will benefit from a smoother, more controlled flow of goods through busy terminals, and reduction of congestion on major roads, thus maximising the utilisation of current infrastructure and making the resourcing of vital activities such as import/export control, policing and border security less costly.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: ChainReact - Making Supplier Networks Transparent, Understandable and Responsive Abstract: ChainReact is an effort to make supplier networks transparent, understandable, and responsive, so that companies and their stakeholders can see, react to, and ultimately transform corporate network impacts.  To this end, we will create an integrated data network supported by three platform struts:
1. A new informer platform (TalkFree) will help advocacy groups manage campaigns to solicit flexible bottom-up reports about corporate behaviour.
2. The world’s largest open repository of corporate information (OpenCorporates) will be enhanced to connect these reports to major corporate brands through multi-level corporate network mapping.
3. An open analysis platform (WikiRate.org) will integrate data from both sources (and others, including direct corporate disclosure) and support their interpretation via collaboratively-developed dynamic, network-aware CSR metrics.
Network participation will be driven by outreach campaigns organized in collaboration with advocacy groups, including pilot campaigns with consortium partner Walk Free Foundation, an international non-profit with the mission to eliminate slavery, with a community of 8.5m participants in their campaigns.  Several other major not-for-profit players, including Oxfam International, the Carbon Disclosure Project, and Amnesty International, have also begun discussions around involvement in ChainReact campaigns.

"Title: ZAP - ZAPINAMO – Affordable, future-proof rapid charging infrastructure for electric vehicles from stored [clean and economical] energy Abstract: The European Environment Agency’s ‘Air Quality in Europe 2016 Report’ attributes air pollution to over 467,000 premature deaths across Europe every year. The total economic cost of premature deaths in the WHO European Region has been estimated at €1.47 trillion each year. Emissions from petrol and particularly diesel vehicles (esp. ‘PM2.5’) are a major contributor to this crisis.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are well suited for modern Smart City environments; they produce zero emissions at point of use and less noise pollution compared with gasoline-powered vehicles. However, the growth of charging infrastructure has not kept momentum with vehicle development, limiting the widespread uptake of EVs. The currently available unreliable, slowcharging infrastructure is ineffective, making longer journeys uncertain, causing ‘range anxiety’. Slow chargers take 9 hours or more to charge a car, but upgrading slow chargers to rapid charging posts (involving inflexible sub-station upgrades and associated disruption over a long period) is impractical and costly for local authorities. Existing EV owners consistently report a desire for more extensive – and rapid – public charging infrastructure.

ZAPINAMO is an easily deployable, stored energy based EV rapid charging system; just like a power bank for a mobile phone, but bigger and faster. ZAPINAMO can harvest from various sources, preferably renewables and potentially off-grid supplies. ZAPINAMO utilises highly sophisticated and extremely reliable battery technology together with innovative ZAPINAMO power electronics to provide energy at a point where and when the EV user wants it—even totally off-grid—at the fastest rate / highest power the EV can handle. By advancing sustainability, affordability and security of supply along with economic growth, ZAPINAMO addresses key challenges in the EC Transport White Paper.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: MEESST - MHD Enhanced Entry System for Space Transportation Abstract: (Re-)entry into planetary atmospheres represents one of the most critical phases of space missions, involving high thermal loads on the vehicle surface and radio communication blackout which can last for minutes. As demonstrated with previous scientific studies, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) provides a framework for tackling both issues: high enough electromagnetic (EM) fields can be used to reduce heat fluxes and create a magnetic windowing able to mitigate the blackout. However, the translation of those ideas into an operational radically-new science-enabled technology to be used onboard spacecrafts has not been achieved yet. MEESST aims at filling the gap between science and technology towards the development of a first demonstrator implementing active magnetic shielding. To this end, a disruptive device consisting of a compact cryostat integrating a superconductive magnet able to generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields will be designed, manufactured, tested in on-ground experimental plasma facilities and via numerical simulations relying upon improved models. The latter will take into account, for the first time, all relevant EM-plasma interactions, thermochemical nonequilibrium and radiation effects for both Earth and Mars atmospheres. As a result, a radically-new science-enabled proof-of-concept technology will be developed and deployed, together with enhanced experimental techniques and modelling tools which can contribute to push European space technology one step ahead the competition, worldwide. The success of MEESST can introduce a paradigm shift in aerospace science and technology by turning active magnetic shielding (i.e. a futuristic concept traditionally associated to science fiction) into reality and potentially into the spotlight, not just for space travel but also for future hypersonic transportation systems, radar imaging, surveillance and GPS navigation, all requiring accurate knowledge of EM signal propagation characteristics through plasmas.","[""radar""]"
"Title: MARCONI - Multimedia and Augmented Radio Creation: Online, iNteractive, Individual Abstract: Nowadays, radio shows surpass linear broadcast feeds by increasingly revolving around user engagement, which encompasses audience interaction and experience personalisation. Indeed, a typical consumer increasingly interacts with the radio station through digital platforms and social media. Unfortunately, the tools to enable radio-makers to capitalize on these new kinds of media and interaction opportunities are premature at best, and are in addition ill-aligned with contemporary radio production workflows.

MARCONI aims to bring radio experiences to the next level, enabling radio to safeguard its strong position in the European media market, while at the same time facilitating innovative ways of radio making. The goal is to enable fully interactive and personalised radio solutions, integrating broadcast radio with digital and social media, amounting to converged radio experiences. To realize this goal, MARCONI will pursue two concrete objectives. First, consumers will be able to interact with “live” radio through their preferred communication channel in ways that are richer than is feasible today, so that consumers feel more connected to the radio brand -even when not listening linearly- and better served in an individual way. Second, radio-makers will be given an integrated view on audience interactions and will be supported by interaction automation services. The net outcome will be enhanced audience engagement.

MARCONI brings together a multi-disciplinary consortium to realize its vision. Several partners will focus on AI to automate processing of audio-visuals, text and social media posts. A radio redaction solutions provider is represented in the consortium to guarantee smooth integration in real operational workflows. MARCONI also includes broadcasters which will organise large-scale pilots with their respective communities. Finally, strong industry participation (SMEs and radio stations) ensures that the MARCONI market potential will be properly exploited.","[""radio and television"", ""telecommunications""]"
"Title: XMOS - Multimodal context and voice recognition for seamless voice control technology interfaces with low upfront cost Abstract: The “Internet of Things” is adding intelligent capabilities and connectivity to all kinds of objects in our environments. With potentially hundreds of smart devices surrounding us in our everyday, we need easier, more natural ways to interact with these technologies – which free our hands from controls, and help us put down our smartphones with their endless apps and distractions. While voice control is becoming a widely accepted alternative, it is not yet sufficiently robust and reliable for use in many situations.
XMOS are playing a fundamental role in the development of a next generation of human-machine interfaces – using natural language, the highly-developed systems of speech and gestures etc. used when people communicate. Embedded within their customers’ consumer electronics, this will enable devices to recognise and understand us, reading context and quickly interacting like another person would – but anonymously and securely, using sound and radar. XMOS’ capabilities will drive new classes of voice controlled devices, with low upfront cost allowing ubiquitous deployment of voice control, and higher quality user experience.
The experienced XMOS team has successfully commercialised their flexible XCore microprocessor, and is now focussed on voice interfaces as a high-growth sector.

"Title: SMARTFISH - Smart fisheries technologies for an efficient, compliant and environmentally friendly fishing sector Abstract: The objective of SMARTFISH is to develop, test and promote a suite of high-tech systems for the EU fishing sector, to optimize resource efficiency, to improve automatic data collection for fish stock assessment, to provide evidence of compliance with fishery regulations and to reduce ecological impact. SMARTFISH exploits technological developments in machine vision, camera technology, data processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data analysis, smartphones/tablets, LED technology, acoustics and ROV technology to build systems for monitoring, analyzing and improving processes for all facets of the fishing sector, from extraction, to assessment, to monitoring and control. The SMARTFISH systems will:
- assist fishermen in making informed decisions during pre-catch, catching, and post-catch phases of the extraction process. This improves catch efficiencies and compositions in fisheries across the EU, leading to improved economic efficiency while reducing unintended fish mortality, unnecessary fishing pressure and ecosystem damage.
- provide new data for stock assessment from commercial fishing and improve the quality and quantity of data that comes from traditional assessment surveys. This provides more accurate assessment of currently assessed stocks and allow the assessment of data-poor stocks.
- permit the automatic collection of catch data to ensure compliance with fisheries management regulations. 
The SMARTFISH systems are tested and demonstrated in several EU fisheries. This contributes to promoting the uptake of the systems by extraction sector and fisheries agencies. An interdisciplinary consortium with technology developers and instrument suppliers, fishing companies, research and fisheries management institutes and universities will realize SMARTFISH. They are active at national and international levels and well placed to ensure the uptake of SMARTFISH systems by fishing industry and fisheries managers and stock assessment scientists.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: BANYAN - Big dAta aNalYtics for radio Access Networks Abstract: As mobile services consumed by people and machines become increasingly diversified and heterogeneous, 4G/5G
networks are asked to meet a growing variety of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Network slicing, enabled by Network
Function Virtualization (NFV), is a promising paradigm to increase the agility and elasticity of the mobile network via logical
slices that can be formed and composed dynamically, so as to adapt to the fluctuations in the demands for different mobile
services.

A key enabler for network slicing is accurate data-driven models and the prediction of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the
mobile service traffic, which allow discovering knowledge relevant to the orchestration of slices and anticipating the need for
their reconfiguration. The need for effective data-driven slice management is especially critical in proximity of indoor Radio
Access Network (RAN), which must accommodate most of the volume and variations in the demand associated to each
mobile service and whose performance is crucial to user QoS.

The BANYAN project is designed to address major open issues towards the realisation of data-driven 5G RAN, as follows:
- Modelling and forecasting macroscopic high-dimensional mobile traffic patterns observed at RAN for individual services, at
multiple scales in time and space; 
- Geo-locating and characterising in-building mobile traffic patterns observed at RAN;
- Designing data-driven strategies for the allocation of 5G RAN resources; 
- Designing data-driven policies for the orchestration of 5G RAN resources to suit service requirements and dynamics via network slices;
- Coordinating outdoor and indoor heterogeneous networks to meet user QoS requirements.

To address the research objectives above, BANYAN pursues a tight academic-industrial cooperation, which will allow
developing key tools for data-driven 5G RAN, as well as properly training early-stage researchers who are urgently needed
by industry, academia, etc.","[""5G""]"
"Title: SmarterEMC2 - Smarter Grid: Empowering SG Market Actors through Information and Communication Technologies Abstract: Power systems undergo massive technological changes due to the ever increasing concerns for environmental and energy sustainability. The increase of RES and DG penetration is one of the main goals in Europe in order to meet the environmental targets. However these goals will require new business cases and must be based on innovative ICT tools and communication infrastructure. On parallel, following the M/490 EU Mandate, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI proposed a technical report describing the Smart Grid Reference Architecture and the Smart Grids Architecture Model (SGAM) framework. A key objective of new Research and Innovation projects should be to provide solutions and ICT tools compatible with the SGAM and the standardization activity in Europe. Such new projects should also support the standardization activity by proposing additions or changes related to their objectives. Another key issue to address is whether the existing telecommunication infrastructure is sufficient to support in mass scale the new business cases and Smart Grid services. SmarterEMC2 implements ICT tools that support Customer Side Participation and RES integration, and facilitate open access in the electricity market. These tools take into account the SGAM as well the future structure of the Distribution Network as described by the relevant EU bodies and organizations. The project supports standardization activity by proposing adaptation to data models of market-oriented standards (IEC 62325-351) and field level standards (IEC 61850). Moreover, the project is fully dedicated towards achieving a maximum of impact. To validate the proposed technologies, the project includes 3 real-world pilots and large-scale simulation in 3 laboratories. The former will demonstrate the impact of Demand Response and Virtual Power Plants services in the real world settings, while the latter will reveal the ability of the communication networks to support massive uptake of such services.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: CNT-QUBIT - Carbon Nanotube Quantum Circuits Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to use spin qubits defined in carbon nanotube quantum dots to demonstrate measurement-based entanglement in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture. The project makes use of spin-orbit interaction to drive spin rotations in the carbon nanotube host system and hyperfine interaction to store quantum information in the nuclear spin states. The proposal builds on techniques developed by the principal investigator for fast and non-invasive read-out of the electron spin qubits using radio-frequency reflectometry and spin-to-charge conversion.

Any quantum computer requires entanglement. One route to achieve entanglement between electron spin qubits in quantum dots is to use the direct interaction of neighbouring qubits due to their electron wavefunction overlap. This approach, however, becomes rapidly impractical for any large scale quantum processor, as distant qubits can only be entangled through the use of qubits in between. Here I propose an alternative strategy which makes use of an intriguing quantum mechanical effect by which two spatially separated spin qubits coupled to a single electrical resonator become entangled if a measurement cannot tell them apart.

The quantum information encoded in the entangled electron spin qubits will be transferred to carbon-13 nuclear spins which are used as a quantum memory with coherence times that exceed seconds. Entanglement with further qubits then proceeds again via projective measurements of the electron spin qubits without risk of losing the existing entanglement. When entanglement of the electron spin qubits is heralded – which might take several attempts – the quantum information is transferred again to the nuclear spin states. This allows for the coupling of large numbers of physically separated qubits, building up so-called graph or cluster states in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: FORMOBILE - From mobile phones to court – A complete FORensic investigation chain targeting MOBILE devices Abstract: Mobile devices, especially smartphones represent a unique challenge for law enforcement. Criminal offenders use phones to communicate, coordinate, organise and execute criminal actions. This is especially true for organised crime and terrorist organisations. This development provides new challenges for criminal prosecution and it is vital to empower law enforcement to access the data stored on mobile devices to use it as court evidence in a trustworthy and reliable manner.  The overarching objective of FORMOBILE is to establish a complete end to end forensic investigation chain, targeting for mobile devices. To achieve this goal three objectives will be pursued. Novel tools shall be developed that include the acquisition of previously unavailable mobile data, unlocking mobile devices, as well as the decoding and analysis of mobile data. Based on the definition of requirements of law enforcement and legal and ethical issues a new mobile forensics standard shall be developed. With the developments of the new standard and the new tools, training for police and criminal prosecution will be established, providing the end users with the latest knowledge in a novel and an innovative curriculum to ensure a quality standard of investigations.   The European Union has developed as a Security Union, building on the European Agenda on Security. This aims to ensure that people live in an area of freedom, security and justice, without internal frontiers. To strengthen digital forensics in the context of criminal investigations is crucial to achieve this vision. FORMOBILE contributes to the fight against virtually all forms of crime. This is because mobile devices are widely used in crimes, especially in the arrangement of conspiracies. Yet, there are crimes more closely related to mobile devices; this includes child abuse and emerging forms of cybercrime in particular. To fight crime effectively, law enforcement has to be empowered to access all evidence stored on mobile devices.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: INSTINCT - Inhibiting Stress in the Construction Industry Abstract: Work-related stress is costing the UK economy about 10 million man-hours and €16 billion. An intervention to curb the advent of stress is proposed: ‘Stress-Blocker’ (Streblo). Cognitive psychology identifies five main personalities (Big-5): extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness. How these Big-5 differ in the dynamics of stress are unexplored, particularly in the field of construction where stress is also prevalent. Behavioural science explains differences in the coping abilities of people. Thus Part A of the study is an empirical investigation of the impacts of stressors on the Big-5 and their different coping behaviours. Data from at least 1500 UK construction personnel will be collected using a questionnaire, and analysed using multiple inferential statistical techniques: hierarchical regression, factor analysis and sequential equation modelling. The findings will then inform Part B: the development of Streblo, a cloud-based IT tool for the effective recognition and deterrence of stress. Streblo will operate on artificial intelligence and its initial simulation will be carried out using of the WEKA software. Data from 1200 respondents will be used to train Streblo while the remaining 300 pseudo responses will be used to pilot (validate) the performance of the product. Streblo will also be validated with the partner organisations and project managers, through focus group meetings which will be recorded, transcribed and analysed using the ‘Nvivo’ software. Streblo will then be launched as a simple, quick-to-use and free IT app which will be accessible on mobile devices, PCs and laptops. Streblo will exploit advanced technologies to prevent stress in different construction job profiles as well as other sectors of the economy. It will be the first worldwide integrated system that is based on personality profiling and associated coping skills to empower individuals to manage event-related stress in the context of their job roles.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: Light UP - Visible Light Ultrafast Photodetector for Optical Wireless Communication Technology Abstract: From beacon fires in early civilizations to emerging light networked wireless communication in modern society, optical wireless communication technologies (OWC) continues to play a pivotal role for mankind. The emergence of flexible and wearable electronic applications are now posing novel challenges to OWC whereby clothes, mechanically flexible design materials and even the human skin are increasingly being considered as possible supports for multifunctional applications.
Light UP has the ambition to transform the scenario of wearable OWC by developing a conceptually new class of ultrathin and flexible photodetectors with an expected time response as fast as a few tens of picoseconds, greatly surpassing any rivalling present wearable technology. The groundbreaking innovation that will enable this breakthrough will be based on the realization of a so-called “wide quantum well” in high quality atomically thin materials in which the ultrafast formation of a charge dipole upon light absorption will lead to a fast on/off optical modulation of the electrical signal in transistor geometries. Atomically thin materials will be engineered ad hoc by exploiting surface chemistry to heal defect and to exert a superior control over their energy band structure in order to obtain well-suited electronic, optical, and physical properties. 
This ambitious interdisciplinary exploration will thrive on the unique synergy of the complementary expertise and skills by the applicant and host group encompassing nano-chemistry, material science, engineering and physics. Hence, this project will address a forefront research program pioneering (1) the development of a scalable solution-phase scheme for chemical engineering of defect states in atomically thin semiconductors; (2) the implementation of defect-free atomically thin semiconductors in ultrafast photodetector; and (3) the realization of atomically thin ultrafast photodetectors onto technological relevant flexible substrates.","[""radio technology""]"
"Title: MigrationRadar - Elucidating continental-scale patterns of bird migration with weather radars Abstract: Migration is a wide-spread phenomenon which allows animals of many different taxa to take advantage of seasonal variation in resource abundance. Radar is a powerful tool to observe and track migratory flights. In this action I will use the existing European network of weather radars to investigate bird migration behaviour and patterns at the continental-scale in relation to topography, weather and insect migration. A unique aspect of this action is that I will have access not only to bird migration data from weather radars, but also to complementary data from small-scale dedicated biological radars (units specifically designed to monitor bird and insect migration), as well as bird ringing and monitoring data from several key locations (migration hotspots). Weather radars will provide data on bird migration patterns at the continental-scale (along the “Western European Flyway”); the small-scale biological radars will provide more detailed information on insect and bird migration patterns at specific sites; and the ringing and monitoring data will provide species composition at specific points along the flyway. Together this will give us a unique overview of the flux and behaviour of migratory animals across Europe, something that has never before been possible.

The objectives of the work packages in this action will be:

WP 1:  To describe the flux of bird migration in relation to weather and topography across the western fly-way in Europe, and relate this to insect migration at specific sites and monitoring data along the fly-way. 

WP 2: To investigate flight behaviour of bird and insect migrants in relation to winds at both a continental and local scale, testing theoretical predictions of how migrants should use winds optimally. 

WP 3: To investigate the nightly duration of bird migration across latitudes and the seasonal progression of migration.","[""radar""]"
"Title: INTERSTELLAR - Building the next generation high-speed data converters to strengthen European excellence and competitiveness on space applications and beyond Abstract: The proposed INTERSTELLAR project addresses one critical topic of European non-dependence under the line “High speed DAC-ADC based on European Technology” – analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue data converters. E2V designs, manufactures, supplies to the space market these essential components, but faces keen competition from US providers. To preserve know-how and production of such competitive components in Europe and to underscore its efforts for non-dependence, the industrial consortium proposes to develop two new data converters and to mature them to TRL6. A four-channel ADC, sampling at up to 6 GSPs offers ultra-wide input bandwidth, flexibility and high-speed serial outputs. A multi-channel DAC, reconstructing at up to 6 GSPs offers multi-Nyquist output bandwidth, configurable modes and high-speed serial inputs. Using a European semiconductor technology, the new converters shall target performances beyond today’s state-of-the-art to ensure their competitiveness by their delivery dates. Such devices facilitate innovative Rx-to-Tx signal chain solutions for satellite telecommunications, earth observation, navigation and scientific missions. To achieve the challenging objectives set, the four partners have intimate knowledge in space technology and will bring expertise to the project. E2V (F), coordinator, will be in charge of design, manufacturing and test activities. AIRBUS Defence & Space (UK) and THALES ALENIA SPACE (F), the two major European space companies, will make a key contribution as end-users of space data converters – guiding initial requirements and evaluating the devices under relevant conditions. The Fraunhofer Institute (D) will significantly contribute with reference PCBs hosting the new ADC and DAC, thus enabling detailed device evaluation and enhancing the dissemination of the results. Assembling such honed skills within a fruitful cooperation, promises to make the INTERSTELLAR project a great success for the European space industry.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: VRACE - VRACE - Virtual Reality Audio for Cyber Environments Abstract: „Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have the potential to become the next big computing platform, and as we saw with the PC and Smartphone, we expect new markets to be created and existing markets to be disrupted.“ (Understanding the Race for the Next Computing Platform, Goldman Sachs 2016). While its technology is still considered in the early stages of development, it is already mature in the video game area.
VR/AR has the potential to change the way we do business, social interactions or education, but its applicability beyond gaming requires further development. An important field of research is the audio part. The importance of sound becomes evident when considering how people orientate themselves in space. Unlike seeing, hearing allows us to perceive instantly from all angles, and plays a leading role in giving us clues where to look at. To support natural orientation in VR/AR, the visual and auditory information has to closely match, as otherwise the illusion is shattered and the experience is not convincing.
VRACE aims at providing physically correct and perceptually convincing soundscapes in VR. This goal is pursued through dedicated training of ESRs in all VR-related domains, namely physical modelling, sound propagation, audio rendering and psychoacoustics. Specific research projects involve modelling of sound sources, such as musical instruments, voices, vehicles, colliding objects or environmental sound sources, studying sound propagation in complex interior spaces like concert halls and in outdoor environments such as urban or rural areas and investigating human perception and localisation of sounds.
With an estimated revenue of $80bn by 2025 (G&S) the demand for trained VR audio experts will increase rapidly. Besides advancing methodologies in this cutting-edge technology, VRACE will train 15 ESRs who will multiply and spread this knowledge in industry and academia. VRACE thus gives European industry a competitive edge in this global race.","[""mobile phones""]"

The goal of REVERSE is to develop and implement cost-effective strategies and tools for the prevention and clinical management of healthcare-associated infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens, and to reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance in high prevalence healthcare settings. To achieve these goals, REVERSE will use a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative research with implementation science and economic analysis. The aim is to produce results that go beyond the evidence-base we have today. REVERSE will answer the question about real-life effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes in combination with antibiotic stewardship on healthcare-associated infections due to multidrug-resistant microorganisms. It will offer implementation strategies to the participating hospitals but also study the effectiveness of external implementation support in a hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. REVERSE will develop a novel health-economic framework that allows for incorporating of effect of changes in the use of a range of antibiotics on antibiotic resistant infections, and estimating long-term population effects, to integrate both into cost-effectiveness analyses. It will be able to conclude on effectiveness and applicability of prevention strategies in lower-resource settings by cross-checking its programmes with activities in low-and-middle income countries.  Four European countries will have a platform of highly experienced hospitals to build on and expand a national network for combatting antibiotic resistance.

"Title: ComRad - Combining MIMO Radar with MU-MIMO Communications: More than Coexistence (ComRad) Abstract: Frequency spectrum has nowadays become one of the most valuable assets, as the wireless communications devices and services are growing explosively. Realising the scarcity of the spectrum, future wireless systems are exploring the feasibility to use the spectrum that is currently occupied by radar systems, such as 3.4GHz and 5.6GHz bands used by airborne and shipborne radars. With the allocation of available spectrum to newer communication technologies, the interference in radar bands is on the rise consequently. Therefore, effective interference management approaches are needed for achieving the spectral coexistence between the current radar and communication services. More fundamentally, dual-functional systems that can simultaneously perform remote sensing and transmit useful information via classical communications could be an essential solution in the future, which not only ensures the spectral coexistence but also the improvement for both radar and communication’s performance. The goal of ComRad is to develop novel signal processing techniques for transmit and receive beamforming, waveform design, signal classification/recognition, and channel estimation, to enable the exploitation of radar spectrum for communication applications, with particular focus on 1) coexisting communication and radar systems (C-ComRad), and 2) Dual-functional Communication-Radar Systems (D-ComRad). The main research approaches that will be employed include the cutting-age concepts of interference exploitation, manifold based optimization and machine learning.

"Title: Tangi0 - Touch and pressure sensitive material without electronic sensors for intuitive and eye-free control of a car’s features while driving Abstract: Current in-car controls have many individual components and parts included, making them very costly to assemble. If even one of the parts fails the controls won’t work and car models could be recalled by the factory to have to fix the issue. The assembled components are difficult to take apart and need to go through a timely, costly process to be recycled and not be turned into e-waste. The main problem behind in-car controls are that they cause significant distractions to drivers which has been found the cause of 80% of road traffic accidents. The problem is only becoming worse with infotainment displays imbedded with multiple lights and sensors and controls being inputted through a large touch-screen device.
Tangi0 have developed a new method for operating controls in the cockpit of cars through an intuitive, tactile material with distinctive shapes that allow drivers to operate it eye-free. This reduces the safety hazards of driving distractions.

"Title: QMiCS - Quantum Microwave Communcation and Sensing Abstract: ""The mission of QMiCS is to combine European expertise and lead the efforts in developing novel components, experimental techniques, and theory models building on the quantum properties of continuous-variable propagating microwaves. QMiCS’ long-term visions are (i) distributed quantum computing & communication via microwave quantum local area networks (QLANs) and (ii) sensing applications based on the illumination of an object with quantum microwaves (quantum radar). With respect to key quantum computing platforms (superconducting circuits, NV centers, quantum dots), microwaves intrinsically allow for zero frequency conversion loss since they are the natural frequency scale. They can be distributed via superconducting cables with surprisingly little losses, eventually allowing for quantum communication and cryptography applications. Radar works at gigahertz frequencies because of the atmospheric transparency windows anyways. Scientifically, QMiCS targets a QLAN demonstration via quantum teleportation, a quantum advantage in microwave illumination, and a roadmap to real-life applications for the second/third phase of the QT Flagship. Beneath these three grand goals lies a strong component of disruptive enabling technology provided by two full and one external industry partner: the development of a microwave QLAN cable connecting the millikevin stages of two dilution refrigerators, improved cryogenic semiconductor amplifiers, and packaged pre-quantum ultrasensitive microwave detectors. The resulting """"enabling"""" commercial products are beneficial for quantum technologies at microwave frequencies in general. Finally, QMiCS fosters awareness in industry about the revolutionary business potential of quantum microwave technologies, especially via the advisory third parties “Airbus Defence and Space Ltd” and “Cisco Systems GmbH”. In this way, QMiCS helps placing Europe at the forefront of the second quantum revolution and kick-starting a competitive European quantum industry.""","[""microwave technology"", ""radar""]"
"Title: INNOVATION - Multi-wavelength regeneration technologies for advanced modulation optical signals Abstract: The ultimate goal of this Fellowship, entitled “Multi-wavelength regeneration technologies for advanced modulation optical signals” (INNOVATION) is to train a talented researcher through a research project focused on the development of all-optical regeneration subsystems handling multi-wavelength and advanced modulation signal waveforms in a single device. Focusing on the hardcore issue of multi-wavelength regeneration “how to reduce nonlinear crosstalk for spectrally efficient advanced modulation signals”, the Fellow proposes pioneering concepts including novel nonlinear devices (nonlinear multi-core fibres and phase-sensitive parametric oscillator units), new crosstalk suppression methods (spatial-division-multiplexing and bidirectional oscillation methods). The resulting regeneration subsystems will dramatically reduce cost and power consumption by combining the nonlinear processing with high-speed multiplexing. Finally, the system testing will demonstrate a multi-wavelength (>8 channels), multi-phase-shift-keying (MPSK) signal regeneration in a commercial network, which offers a high-capacity and green technology alternative to core switching nodes. The INNOVATION outputs will significantly increase the competitiveness of European communications industry in broadband technologies. 
    The Fellow – Dr. Feng Wen – will be trained in the fast-growing field of all-optical signal processing, receiving unique training experiences at the host: Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (Prof. Sergei K. Turitsyn), and industrial partners: Xtera Communications (Dr. Stuart Barnes), France Telecom (Dr. Erwan Pincemin) and OFS (Dr. Lars Grüner-Nielsen).

"Title: WAVECOMBE - mmWave Communications in the Built Environments Abstract: The foreseen exponential growth of mobile data traffic will not be uniform across geographical areas, but is mainly concentrated in hot spots that are usually located in the built environments (BEs) such as central business districts, stations, airports, stadiums, dense urban environments, etc. This poses considerable challenges that we believe can be solved by ultra dense deployment of millimetre-wave (mmW) small-cells (SCs) in conjunction with massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) in 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks. However, there are a number of research challenges that need to be addressed for a successful deployment of 5G/B5G wireless networks: even if the theoretical background of massive MIMO is by now rather complete, the actual performance characterization and measurements of mmW antenna arrays has not yet been fully addressed at either the component or system level; mmW radio channel measurements have
been performed but with limited time delay resolution, single antennas and over single radio links; and mmW bands have been considered for mobile communications, but the level of detail and diversity of BEs necessary for meaningful mmW SC deployment has not been fully exploited. Therefore, we propose here a research approach that combines the three disruptive key enabling technologies for 5G/B5G with the aim to answer fundamental questions that are still not well understood. 

Hence, the research objectives of the project are as follows: 
• Develop and test mmW MIMO and massive MIMO antennas.
• Characterize and model radio propagation channel at mmW bands for typical BEs (offices, homes, stations, airports).
• Theoretically analyse and optimise massive MIMO mmW SC performance in the BEs.
• Integrate massive MIMO mmW SC networks with their operating environments.
• Develop methods to retrofit existing buildings and to design new buildings for efficient high-capacity wireless communications in the BEs.","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"

"Title: CLEAN-HEAT - A highly efficient intelligent industrial microwave heating system based on high power solid state technology Abstract: Magnetrons are the most widely used microwave technology today for both industrial and domestic microwaves. But these systems can only achieve efficiencies of around 45 to 50%, pose safety risks as the use high voltages (5kV) and the magnetrons have a short lifespan requiring frequent replacement. Magnetron technology does not allow for the automatic adjustment of power level to match the load variations. These limitations have a huge cost to industrial microwave processes and there are calls for more efficient solutions.  Across Europe, microwaves consume over 9.6 TWh of electrical energy annually.
F&M seeks to upscale its 200W solid state continuous wave microwave system to address these limitations. The 1kW gallium nitride based microwave system will save at least 25% on electricity consumption, operate at more than 70% efficiency, allow automatic adjustment of power level in response to load variations and significantly reduce equipment size. It will also provide increased lifespan eliminating the need for frequent and costly replacements.  With all these excellent features and performance advantages, our product also comes at a very competitive cost to the user which lies in the same range with the magnetron systems.
Solid state microwave technology can be used in moisture meters, medical applications like RF-Surgery, and microwave ovens for the manufacture of electronic assemblies. It also offers opportunity for automatic power matching that enhances energy efficiency and faster processing speeds. Full adoption of our technology in both domestic and industrial microwave ovens would lead to potential energy savings of 6.74TWh of electrical power across Europe.","[""microwave technology""]"
"Title: GREENEDGE - Taming the environmental impact of mobile networks through GREEN EDGE computing platforms Abstract: Modern communication networks are rapidly evolving into sophisticated systems combining communication and computing capabilities. Computation at the network edge is key to supporting many emerging applications, from extended reality to smart health, smart cities, smart factories and autonomous driving. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is being developed to deliver the required computation functionalities closer to user devices, directly at mobile access points. GREENEDGE is motivated by the fact that the large scale adoption of MEC technology, while benefiting human productivity and efficiency, will result in a surge of data and computation in mobile networks, which, in turn, will exacerbate their energy consumption. GREENEDGE is set out to tame the growing carbon footprint of MEC technology, devising highly energy efficient communication and computing functionalities for the network edge, combining them with ambient energy sources and with new energy storage and supply paradigms. As a result, GREENEDGE technology will allow mobile systems to offer the much anticipated communication and computing services in a sustainable manner. Fifteen early stage researchers (ESRs) will be trained by a consortium of world-class leaders across the fields of energy harvesting, storage, edge computing, optimization, machine learning and wireless communications. Ample inter-sectoral opportunities will be offered thanks to secondments among academy/research centers, two network operators, and other prominent industrial partners operating in the domains of Internet of Things, smart cities, critical infrastructure management and data analytics. A carefully planned and coordinated training and research program will ensure excellent employability prospects for the ESRs after the project completion.","[""mobile network""]"
"Title: SOLOMON - Self-Organisation and Learning Online in Mobile Observation Networks Abstract: Smart cameras are embedded devices combining a visual sensor, a processing unit and a communication interface, allowing the processing of images on the device, such that only aggregated information, instead of raw video data, is transmitted. Smart camera networks are typically used for large-scale high value security applications such as person tracking in airports or amusement parks. However, current smart cameras are expensive and have only very limited mobility, acting as a barrier to their wider adoption. The SOLOMON project is driven by the rising demand for rapid-deployment camera networks which can adapt to provide security in the context of unforeseen situations and unfolding scenarios. This is evidenced by the rapid growth of leading body-cam company Edesix Ltd, whose VideoBadge technology is being adopted by police forces worldwide . However, recent research advances in smart camera networks have not yet been realised in dynamic body-worn camera networks, and still rely on prohibitively expensive static hardware. In the SOLOMON project we envision a novel type of lightweight, inexpensive smart camera network suitable for rapid deployment and reconfiguration, where low-cost camera devices such as Edesix’s VideoBadge, are paired with the processing capabilities of smartphones. These are then worn by people (e.g. police, security guards) or mounted on mobile robots. This not only lowers cost, but allows us to introduce a feedback loop between the sensing cameras and the acting people/robots, enabling the camera network to adapt to changes during runtime, for example to prioritise or cover newly relevant areas sufficiently. Novel techniques in collective decision making and self-organisation as well as multi-objective online learning will need to be developed, in order to achieve this vision.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: 5GZORRO - Zero-touch security and trust for ubiquitous computing and connectivity in 5G networks. Abstract: Despite the progress of last years, 5G today is not yet at a stage of complete achievement of the promised performances and functions: different application profiles (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) do not easily coexist in network slices; slicing is casted in various different forms; network analytics are not at end-to-end scope; services do not span multiple operator domains yet. 

5GZORRO consortium envisions the evolution of 5G to achieve truly production-level support of diverse Vertical applications, which coexist on a highly pervasive shared network infrastructure, through automated end-to-end network slicing, across multiple operators and infrastructure/resource providers, who can share heterogeneous types of resources (spectrum, virtualized radio access, virtualized edge/core). 

5GZORRO uses distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to implement cognitive network orchestration and management with minimal manual intervention (Zero-Touch Automation). Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are adopted to implement flexible and efficient distributed security and trust across the various parties involved in a 5G end-to-end service chain. With these, we can implement an evolved 5G Service Layer for Smart Contracts among multiple non-trusted parties, to allow SLA monitoring, spectrum sharing, intelligent and automated data-driven resource discovery and management. Our cross domain security & trust orchestration coupled with service lifecycle automation can enforce security policies in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments. 

Three use cases validate our research in 5GBarcelona and 5TONIC/Madrid test facilities: Smart Contracts for Ubiquitous Computing/Connectivity, Dynamic Spectrum Allocation, Pervasive virtual CDNs over 3rd-party edge resources. 

5GZORRO target stakeholders are telecom operators, vertical slice owners/operators, spectrum owners, regulators, passive/ active facility owners, many of which are in our consortium of 13 top 5G players from 7 different EU countries.","[""5G""]"
"Title: AdMiRe - Advanced Mixed Realities Abstract: The main goal of AdMiRe is to develop, validate and demonstrate innovation solutions, based on Mixed Reality (MR) technology, which will allow for TV audiences a step change in interactivity, and bring for content creators a radical improvement in talent immersion and interaction with computer generated elements. AdMiRe is focused on sectors where the lead industry partners in the consortium are key players, thus guaranteeing the impact of the innovation and the take up of the technology. 
At present, TV audiences can interact with the shows they are watching only through social media or HBBTV. Comments, video and audio from the audience may be incorporated into TV program formats, but this is done in such a way that viewer engagement is quite limited and there is not much potential for innovation. AdMiRe will radically change this by producing solutions that will allow viewers at home to be incorporated into the live TV program they are watching and to interact with people in the TV studio. The key innovation here is to use a regular mobile phone to capture the viewer, extract him/her from the background and finally composite the viewer into the studio footage as an MR object. 
As for content creators, be it in film, TV or live productions, there is an ever growing trend to combine actors and performers with computer generated objects and have them interact. But the number and difficulty of the technical challenges involved have resulted in methods and technologies of reduced scope, resulting in less engaging content. AdMiRe takes the exact opposite approach, producing authoring tools that remove the main technological obstacles and that will allow actors to be immersed in virtual environments, performers to feel at home within the space, and directors to have the opportunity to better capture emotion, all in all resulting in the possibility to create more compelling visuals and more engaging programming.","[""mobile phones""]"

Galileo is what we call the European GNSS (EGNSS) and is to be fully operational around 2020, therefore the pressing need to invest on research and training right now. This is especially so because GPS has clearly been the frontrunner of all these systems and has dominated the market for two decades now. EGNSS (Galileo) is aimed at changing this market unbalance and is the main focus of this proposal, which concentrates on its use in support of applications demanding high accuracy positioning and navigation.  TREASURE’s cohort of 13 young researchers will be given gap-bridging innovative training through an exceptional and unique network of industrial, research and academic beneficiaries, with the aim to form a group of outstanding researchers who would not be able to acquire the equivalent set of skills by training at any individual European institution alone. World-class expertise on EGNSS exists in Europe, however multi-disciplinary research skills need expanding to maximise the enormous potential that there is for promotion and exploitation of this technology. TREASURE addresses that need and responds to the much desired involvement of end-users and businesses, by bringing together four top Universities, one research Institute and four leading European companies, with extensive track record and experience in a wide breadth of disciplines to provide the necessary coordinated research training that will enable the ultimate real time high accuracy EGNSS solution.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: DAMOSET - With data-driven modelling towards a successful energy transition Abstract: The power grid is an integral part of the power system. It connects all electrical consumers with generators and powers everything from household appliances to large factory machinery. Without this grid, farmers would not be able to feed their animals, car factories would come to a halt, mobile phone systems would fail and many of us would not even be able to make a cup of tea. While the current power system is very reliable and offers a high quality of service, it remains unclear how this will develop in the future. The limited supply of fossil fuels as well as necessary reduction of CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, will eventually lead to a power grid mainly supplied by renewable generators, such as wind and solar plants. These plants output smaller total power so that a large number is necessary which have to be geographically distributed for optimal weather conditions. The current power grid system slowly emerged within several decades of optimization processes. However, now we are discussing how to revolutionize the whole energy system within years. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the current power system is necessary to develop potential pathways to a future 100% sustainable system. In the proposed research, I will use data-driven approaches to work towards a quantitative understanding of fluctuations in the power grid, as they are for example introduced by the changing demand or volatile energy generation. I will analyse the British as well as international grids to understand differences in grid operation and potential solutions for grids. A key goal of the proposed project is to offer a data base of these measurements for the scientific community to analyse and to add to. Within this project, I will also develop analysis tools to be used by the scientific community as well as interested companies or government agencies.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: BD4QoL - Big Data Models and Intelligent tools for Quality of Life monitoring and participatory empowerment of head and neck cancer survivors Abstract: Head and neck cancer can take away a patient’s “right to feel human,” and its impact on physical appearance, physical functioning, psychological status and general quality of life (QoL) can be devastating. Over the past several decades, the number of patients who survive head and neck cancer (HNC) has increased; this makes lifelong surveillance critical. HNC imposes an extremely high socioeconomic burden on patients during and after cancer compared to other tumors, including costs from treatment-induced morbidities, loss of workforce participation and short-term disability. Current survivorship care plans mostly focus on functional and health conditions of treated patients, whereas socioeconomic determinants of quality of life are often neglected due to difficult data collection.

"Title: SETA - SETA: An open, sustainable, ubiquitous data and service ecosystem for efficient, effective, safe, resilient mobility in metropolitan areas Abstract: Around 50% of the global population lives in metropolitan areas, and this is expected to grow to 75% by 2050. Mobility within these areas is complex as it involves multiple modalities of transport, multiple managing authorities, as well as several millions of citizens. The cost of inefficiency in transport and mobility are enormous. For example, inefficiency costs the UK economy €5.8 billion each year. €583 million is wasted on fuel (e.g. traffic congestion) alone each year, which attributes to increased urban pollution and CO2. Hold-ups to business or freight vehicles amounts to €1.5bn annually.
Mobility generates huge amounts of data thought thousands of sensors, city cameras, and connected cars, as well as millions of citizens connected through their mobile devices. If properly managed, this data can be used to understand, optimise and manage mobility and make it more efficient, sustainable and resilient. 
SETA will address this challenge, creating a technology and methodology able to use this wealth of data to change the way mobility is organised, monitored and planned in large metropolitan areas. The solution will be able to collect, process, link and fuse high-volume, high-velocity, multi-dimensional, heterogeneous, cross-media, cross-sectorial data and to use it to model mobility with a precision, granularity and dynamicity that is impossible with today’s technologies. Such models will be the basis of pervasive services to citizens and business, as well as decision makers to support safe, sustainable, effective, efficient and resilient mobility.
The project has the potential to impact the everyday lives of millions of people, their health and the environment with enormous financial and social impact. 
SETA’s solution will be evaluated rigorously by citizens, business and decision makers in 3 cities across Europe.

"Title: MetaVEH - Metamaterial Enabled Vibration Energy Harvesting Abstract: Increasing demand for fully autonomous wireless sensors to service the emerging technologies of the internet of things, remote and real time monitoring of vulnerable environments or self-sensing smart structures is driving a requirement for efficient and novel methods of energy harvesting. The sensor's data communication has a substantial power requirement that presents a serious constraint upon the number of sensors, and their capability. Our primary aim is to realise innovative Lead-free electromechanical energy harvesters; these will be easily installed, to power, in a clean and low-cost manner, autonomous wireless sensing devices thereby eliminating batteries and human intervention: This will revolutionise sensor applications whilst simultaneously reducing chemical waste. This is timely as in current solutions battery replacement is either logistically impossible or too expensive and batteries carry a toxic chemical cost. Solar panels have the environmental drawback of using toxic materials. In our vision of future sensor technology, with our vibration energy harvesters (VEH) as their primary power source, a battery, will become unnecessary, and their associated chemical waste will no longer occur, and these sensors will become truly autonomous. The harvester's mechanical core will draw on advanced multiresonator designs, integrating Lead-free piezoelectric patches enhanced by the unique wave control capacities of resonant elastic metamaterials. Currently microVEH, though promising, suffers due to frequency mismatch: We have the ambition to bridge the gap between different scales by leveraging the potential of metamaterials. This will dramatically increase the energy available for harvesting, and operational bandwidth. For electronic applications the integration of rectifiers in the circuitry will allow for the full exploitation of the multiresonant design.","[""radio technology""]"
"Title: PABLO - Power Amplifier Design Through Behavioural Modelling Abstract: 5G base-stations will make use of large antenna arrays (hundreds of elements), potentially with each radiating element fed independently, meaning 1 power amplifier (PA) per element. This situation, combined with the trend of removing the circulator from the PA output for cost and size reasons, the design of the PA needs to take into account for the interaction with the other array elements. As a consequence, the simulation in CAD using traditional transistor models with a large number of internal nodes could become inconvenient, and the use of a behavioral model for the transistor could be an interesting choice.

The project objective is to design 5G RF Doherty PAs for the 5G sub- 6 GHz band using transistor behavioral model. The Cardiff Model will be applied for the first time in a Doherty design, guiding the necessary model changes not only to adapt the model to this application, but also exploiting the advantages that the model can give. Moreover, thanks to his knowledge of Doherty, Jorge will identify a procedure to minimize the number of measurements needed to extract the model. In this way, Jorge will enhance his knowledge by working on behavioral modelling (model extraction, implementation in CAD, and modifications) and waveform measurements. CHFE will improve his range of expertise by hosting a design expert and developing the model for a timely and actual application.

This research program is framed in one of the EU2020 targets, which is the efficient use of energy, as an important issue related to the climate change and energy sustainability of the world.  The expansion and increasing pervasiveness of wireless networks has significantly increased the impact of their power consumption.  By delivering a method to design efficient 5G PAs, PABLO will contribute to green and economically viable 5G systems.","[""5G""]"

It is unconventional in the sense that it connects stakeholders from seemingly separately developed fields: computational harmonic analysis, numerical linear algebra, computer algebra, nonlinear approximation theory, digital signal processing and their applications, in one and more variables. It is ambitious because the consortium stretches from mathematics to computational science and engineering and industry.

For example, a substantial amount of effort in signal processing and time series analysis is essentially dedicated to the analysis of multi-exponential functions. Multi-exponential analysis is also fundamental to several research fields and application domains that are the subject of the EXPOWER proposal: remote sensing, antenna design, digital imaging, testing and metrology, all impacting some major societal or industrial challenges such as energy, transportation, space research, health and telecommunications.  The EXPOWER Beneficiaries and Third Country Partners, each bringing in their own complementary expertise, aim at solving some core challenges where the different domains involved with multi-exponential analysis meet. We target game-changing breakthroughs that will deliver a competitive advantage to industry. The EXPOWER project connects 9 countries, 8 universities, 3 international research institutes and 7 companies to explore this highly relevant thematic.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: Comedy and Politics - The Comedy of Political Philosophy.  Democratic Citizenship, Political Judgment, and Ideals in Political Practice. Abstract: Despite the rich history and contemporary relevance of the intersection of comedy, political practices, and political thought, comedy has thus far not received sustained attention in the field of political philosophy. This research programme will address this lacuna by developing parallels between (i) the specific outlook on human action offered by comedies and (ii) the perspective of a tradition of political thought known as political realism.

The overall objective of this research programme is to demonstrate that comedy reflects the theoretical and methodological commitments of political realism, and to establish comedy’s contribution to realism by drawing out realism’s transformative potential. 

Three specific research objectives will be combined to support the overall objective. (a) The first objective will develop an account of democratic citizenship informed by comedy by exploring Aristophanes’ comedies. (b) The second objective will develop an account of political judgment informed by comedy, by analysing Machiavelli’s comedies and political writings in relation to each other. (c) The third objective will develop an account of the relation between ideals and practice in politics informed by comedy by drawing on theoretical reflections on comedy by Hegel, Vischer, and Marx. 

Each of the specific research objectives corresponds to a central feature of political realism. By developing these objectives through comedy, the researcher will explicate structural parallels between comedy and political realism. In each of the specific objectives, the transformative potential inherent in comedy will be elucidated. In doing so, the researcher will use insights derived from this parallel to develop a more nuanced understanding of political realism’s potential to conceptualize social transformation. Thus comedy transpires as the means through which the full potential of realism for political philosophy as a whole can be grasped for the first time.","[""teleology""]"
"Title: SimuSafe - SIMULATOR OF BEHAVIOURAL ASPECTS FOR SAFER TRANSPORT Abstract: Road transport is known to be the most dangerous of all transport modes and poses a major societal challenge for EU. It has been claimed that 90% of road-traffic crashes are caused by driver error, being a significant factor in traffic accidents. Improving road safety means understanding the individual and collective behaviour of actors involved (drivers, two wheelers, pedestrians) and their interaction between themselves and safety-related systems and services. The goal of SIMUSAFE (SIMUlator of Behavioural Aspects for SAFEr Transport) following the FESTA-V model methodology is to  develop realistic multi-agent behavioural models in a transit environment where researchers will be able to monitor and introduce changes in every aspect,  gathering data not available in real world conditions. 
Driving simulators of several vehicles (cars, motorcycles, bicycles) and Virtual Reality (for pedestrians) will be used to simulate test environments. This will also enable the evaluation of scenarios which are not possible even with naturalistic driving (dangerous conditions, multiple monitored actors in the same scene, under influence of substances). Data collected from simulations will be correlated with naturalistic driving tests, such that the simulation and model aspects are the closest possible to real world data. From the developed model and collected data, impacting factors causing an event (crash, near-collision, infractions) from the environment and road users will be identified and quantified. Such knowledge will be the base for the development of more effective and pro-active measures for the prevention and mitigation of such factors, with subsequent impact in the safety devices market, regulations and driver education.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: CAMELOT - C2 Advanced Multi-domain Environment and Live Observation Technologies Abstract: The creation of the Schengen area has been one of the major achievements of the EU. However, this agreement requires countries to cooperate tightly in order to keep a high level of security at their internal borders, as well as to share the responsibility of managing external borders. Such a variety of borders (land, sea and air) and current challenges requires a consistent approach to border surveillance, based on a plethora of heterogeneous assets. These can be manned or unmanned, ranging from sensors (optical, radar, IR) to unmanned platforms (UAV, UGV, USV or UUV), and need to be combined to offer an integrated situational picture of the area under surveillance and of their location. In order to effectively control their operation and manage the large amounts of data collected by them, new approaches for command and control need to be considered, allowing efficient interaction between the operator and the different assets in the field. CAMELOT proposes to develop and demonstrate different advanced command and control service modules for multiple platform domains, based on a SOA architecture that specifies internal and external interfaces, allowing the development of a modular and scalable command and control station, customisable to the user needs. This architecture can be based on results of previous studies and work or open architectures that may prove more suitable and the interfaces can take advantage of the standardisation work that has been done already. After the definition, CAMELOT partners will prototype service modules according to their expertise, background individual technologies and practitioner needs. These will be integrated progressively in specific testing along the project. This prototype development approach will culminate in 2 final demonstrations involving end users and relevant stakeholders, to achieve a maturity of TRL6 (for most individual technologies supporting the functionalities for border surveillance) and an IRL of 7 for CAMELOT.","[""radar""]"
"Title: MONESE - Innovative banking model for improved financial and economic inclusion of population groups that find it difficult to open a traditional bank account Abstract: Owning a bank account has become a precondition for participating in the economic and social life of a modern society. In the EU several population groups face remarkable difficulties in accessing a bank account service: 3.5 million mobile EU residents have had bank account access issues in their target countries and 22 million consumers would like an account but have not attempted to open one. Underlying causes include practices that place non-residents at disadvantage, irregular income, inadequate documentation, and cost and slowness of opening and owning a bank account. It is estimated that the annual opportunity cost of not having a bank account is €185-365 per consumer.

Monese has launched a prototype of a mobile-first banking service that validates customer’s identity fully online, enabling access to banking even for customers with poor credit history or no formal proof of address. Account opening takes place in real-time, enabling 3-3000x faster onboarding (3 minutes). Monese aims to provide local bank accounts across European Economic Area for a transparent low-cost fixed-fee pricing (4x less expensive). The service is currently launched only in UK and has attracted >6000 customers, with 60 000 people waiting to get access.

MONESE project aims to scale up the technical capability of the service for reaching and being able to serve growing number of users – to increase the level of automation of user identification, scale up service architecture and introduce features required for EU-wide reach. Combining these innovations with business model innovation (fixed-fee pricing, streamlined value proposition, value chain deconstruction, focus on underserved people) enables to achieve EU-wide scale in a profitable manner.

Improving the access to bank account services is becoming a primary policy objective, pushing the drive for new products and business models. Development of the service to an EU-wide scale would increase Monese’s revenues by €97 million in 2020.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: SECRET - SEcure Network Coding for Reduced Energy nexT generation Mobile Small cells Abstract: SECRET is a collaborative European Training Network (ETN) committed to create an “excellent” educational training platform; that is multi-disciplinary and intersectoral in nature, for Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) in the field of wireless communications and networking. In this dynamic field, the challenges are always evolving and more stringent in line with market expectation, and socio-economical requirements. 
The chapter of 4G (4th Generation) of mobile systems is finally coming to an end, with waves of 4G systems deployed over Europe and worldwide. 4G systems provide a universal platform for broadband mobile services at any time, any place and anywhere. However, mobile traffic is still growing at an unprecedented rate and the need for more sophisticated broadband services is still further pushing the limits on current standards to provide even tighter integration between wireless technologies and higher speeds. The increase in number of mobile devices and traffic, the change in the nature of service and device, along with the pressure on operation and capital costs, and energy efficiency are all continuously putting stringent limits on the requirement of the design of mobile networks. It is widely accepted that incremental enhancements of current networking paradigm will not achieve or come close to meeting the requirements of networking by 2020 . This has led to the need of a new generation of mobile communications: the so-called 5G. The interests of stakeholders and academic researchers are now focused on 5G paradigm. Although 5G systems are not expected to penetrate the market till 2020, the evolution towards 5G is widely accepted to be the convergence of internet services with existing mobile networking standards leading to the commonly used term “mobile internet” over heterogeneous networks (HetNets), with very high connectivity speeds.

"Title: TWEETHER - Traveling Wave Tube based W-band Wireless Networks with High Data Rate, Distribution, Spectrum and Energy Efficiency Abstract: Never technology has penetrated so deeply and fast in society everyday life as Internet has done in the last decades and is expected to do in the future. The enormous flux of data transferred via wireless networks, increasing at exponential pace, makes today’s state of the art networks soon outdated. Large parts of the society are deprived of adequate access to Internet due to the high costs, long deployment time of optical fibres and inadequate performance of wireless networks. This inequality will most likely pertain in the next years. 
Millimetre waves are the most promising solution to support the increasing data throughput and to be a credible fibre complement for the last miles.
The TWEETHER aim is to realise the millimetre wave Point to multi Point segment to finally link fibre, and sub-6GHz distribution for a full three segment hybrid network, that is the most cost-effective architecture to reach mobile or fixed final individual client. The TWEETHER project responds to the call H2020-ICT6, to foster smart wireless network architecture for high capacity everywhere outdoor data distribution, in gigabit class, that other technologies cannot support, at low operating cost. High spectrum and energy efficient W-band (92-95GHz) technology will be developed. A powerful and compact transmission hub based on a novel traveling wave tube power amplifier with performance precluded to any other technology and an advanced chipset in a compact terminal will be realised. The TWEETHER system will be tested in a real operating environment. Integrated smart networks of backhaul for 4G and 5G small cells and of access for residential houses are the targeted market that benefits from the actual light regulation of W-band.

"Title: SAFARI - Scalable And Flexible optical Architecture for Reconfigurable Infrastructure Abstract: Highly scalable & flexible optical transport networks are urgently required in order to meet the demands for unrelenting exponential data traffic growth (estimated at 40 - 50 % per annum). The number and diversity of bandwidth intensive applications and services is rapidly increasing, leading to new demands on transport networks. The present optical transport networks based on conventional fibres, however, are facing fundamental limits in capacity/throughput and are lacking in terms of network flexibility and control. The Scalable And Flexible optical Architecture for Reconfigurable Infrastructure (SAFARI) project aims at developing programmable optical hardware, and Space-Division Multiplexing (SDM)-based optical component technologies capable of realising highly scalable & flexible optical transport networks for the long term future. The high level objectives of the SAFARI project are to:
- Develop programmable optical hardware allowing novel multi-flow transport functions which is scalable to at least 400 Gbps/channel transport, and implement the critical interworking capability required between the software-defined network (SDN) layer and the physical layer.
- Develop SDM-based optical transport technology based on super-dense, high-count multicore fibres (MCFs) and multicore erbium-doped optical fibre amplifiers (MC-EDFAs). The technology should be capable of supporting more than 30 cores per-fibre.
- Undertake system experiments on scalable & flexible optical transport networks based on the newly developed SDN-controlled interworking capability and capacity-scalable hardware, showcasing the unique functionality and capabilities made possible. Specific attention will be focussed on demonstrating that the SDN-controlled programmability developed is compatible with both existing single-mode-fibre transmission systems and future SDM-based systems, allowing for a graceful upgrade scenario with current systems.","[""optical networks""]"
"Title: OpenAIS - Open Architectures for Intelligent Solid State Lighting Systems Abstract: Following the trends of the creation of the “The Internet of Things” (IoT) and the rapid penetration of SSL based lighting, it is
very advantageous to connect the luminaires in buildings to the Internet.
OpenAIS aims at setting the leading standard for inclusion of lighting for professional applications in to IoT, with a focus on
office lighting. This will enable a transition from the currently existing closed and command oriented lighting control systems
to an open and service oriented system architecture. Openness and service orientation will create an eco-system of
suppliers of interoperable components and a market for apps that exploit the lighting system to add value beyond the lighting
function. Added value can e.g. be related to more efficient use of the building, reduction of carbon footprint and increased
comfort and wellbeing. In addition, IoT will facilitate smooth and effective interaction of the lighting system with other
functions in a building such as e.g. HVAC, security and access control. Extensibility and security of the system architecture
are important aspects and will be guaranteed.
The OpenAIS project will define the requirements and use cases for offices in 2020, define the best open system
architecture, identify existing ICT components to be used and develop additional components. The system will be validated
by a pilot installation in a real office setting. After the OpenAIS project, the Consortium will pursue standardization of the
system architecture, aiming at the creation of the leading standard for Internet connected lighting.
The project brings together a strong collaboration of the leading lighting companies Zumtobel, Tridonic, and Philips and the
major players in IoT technology ARM, NXP and Imtech. Consortium partner Johnson Controls represents the end user and
academic knowledge on ICT and system architecture is present through TU/e and TNO-ESI. During the project, the

"Title: Triangulum - Triangulum: The Three Point Project / Demonstrate. Disseminate. Replicate. Abstract: The Triangulum project will demonstrate how a systems innovation approach based around the European Commission’s SCC Strategic Implementation Plan can drive dynamic smart city development. We will test the SIP across three lighthouse cities: Manchester, Eindhoven and Stavanger, which represent the main typologies of European cities. They will be complemented by our follower cities Prague, Leipzig and Sabadell. This powerful combination reflects an urban population of between 100k and 1,2m inhabitants across six different countries, allowing us to demonstrate successful replication across a wide range of typical urban areas in Europe. Each city has already made significant progress towards the transition of becoming a smart city; developing their own individual approach reflecting specific local circumstances. These inherent strengths will now serve to accelerate the smart city development across proposed demonstration sites within Triangulum. The suite of projects developed will be based around zero/low energy districts, integrated infrastructures and sustainable urban mobility designed to deliver a range of cross-cutting outcomes across different sectors and stakeholders. This will provide the basis to ‘road test’ the SIP and provide recommendations to the Commission on how it could be improved to facilitate wider replication. The Triangulum goals target a series of direct impacts around; reduced energy consumption of buildings, increased use of renewable energies, increased utilisation of electric vehicles, deployment of intelligent energy management technologies and the deployment of an adaptive and dynamic ICT data hub. The design and implementation of innovative Business Models and the activation of citizens as co-creators are core cross-cutting elements to base the technologies in real-world city environments and facilitate replication.","[""fiber-optic network""]"
"Title: 5GEx - 5G Exchange Abstract: The goal of the 5G Exchange (5GEx) project is to enable cross-domain orchestration of services over multiple administrations or over multi-domain single administrations. This will allow end-to-end network and service elements to mix in multi-vendor, heterogeneous technology and resource environments. Market fragmentation has resulted in a multitude of network operators each focused on different countries and regions. This makes it difficult to create infrastructure services spanning multiple countries, such as virtual connectivity or compute resources, as no single operator has a footprint everywhere.

5GEx aims to enable collaboration between operators, regarding 5G infrastructure services, with the view to introducing a unification via NFV/SDN compatible multi-domain orchestration by producing (i) an open platform enabling cross-domain orchestration of services over these multiple domains, with a set of open source software tools and extensions that can be utilised outside the scope of 5GEx; (ii) a Sandbox Network enabling experimentation and validation of the devised architecture, mechanisms, and business models; (iii) a proof-of-innovation multi-domain platform enabling multiple 5G use-cases and realistic scenarios that demonstrate the orchestration of complex end-to-end Infrastructure as a Service across multiple carriers; (iv) contributions to standards bodies of concepts learned during the development and experimentation of the project; (v) input to stimulate the telecom and IT industry stakeholders by actively promoting adoption of 5GEx’s open solutions.

Such 5G infrastructure services will provide a crucial role in making 5G happen as they provide the foundation of all cloud and networking services. 5GEx aims to enable, through operator collaboration, a unified European infrastructure service market integrating multiple operators and technologies, where service provisioning is fast and automated and which results in stronger economy via economies of scale.","[""5G""]"
"Title: SPEED-5G - quality of Service Provision and capacity Expansion through Extended-DSA for 5G Abstract: The objective of SPEED-5G is to research and develop technologies that address the well-known challenges of predicted growth in mobile connections and traffic volume.  A major challenge is the cost of meeting the objective, in terms of both infrastructure and deployment. Today, lack of dynamic control across wireless network resources is leading to unbalanced spectrum loads and a perceived capacity bottleneck. These will be solved by SPEED-5G through eDSA (extended DSA), which is resource management with three degrees of freedom: densification, rationalized traffic allocation over heterogeneous wireless technologies, and better load balancing across available spectrum.
SPEED-5G will investigate indoor and indoor/outdoor scenarios where capacity demands are the highest, but also where the eDSA will be the most effective at exploiting co-operation across technologies and bands. 
The project will focus on two major innovations which are currently missing: resource management techniques across technology ‘silos’, and medium access technologies to address densification in mostly unplanned environments. It will leverage flexible radio approaches expected in 5G (e.g. FBMC). 
SPEED-5G has a very strong consortium, with a mix of operators, industrial partners, SMEs and leading European research institutes. They bring considerable knowledge and technology background to the project in architecture, resource management, protocols, radios, standardization, trials and tests, along with the most advanced of trial facilities, like the 5GIC centre.
The SPEED-5G innovations will be considered in an architectural framework consistent with the 5GPPP. They will be researched, implemented and trialled in SPEED-5G in order to reach high level of maturity and confidence. This will guarantee impact on the 5GPPP program as a whole, on standards and on European technical leadership.","[""5G""]"

Verticals have very different needs, such as the case of the Automotive industry and Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR). This will therefore require different levels of support in taking their applications and services from concepts, to prototypes and finally to products. However, it is also more and more frequent that services in different verticals need to exchange data, particularly mobility services such as those found in connected automobiles and PPDR.

"Title: WATERPROTECT - Innovative tools enabling drinking WATER PROTECTion in rural and urban environments Abstract: High-quality, safe, and sufficient drinking water is essential for life: we use it for drinking, food preparation and cleaning. Agriculture is the biggest source of pesticides and nitrate pollution in European fresh waters. The overarching objective of WATERPROTECT is to contribute to effective uptake and realisation of management practices and mitigation measures to protect drinking water resources. Therefore WATERPROTECT will create an integrative multi-actor participatory framework including innovative instruments that enable actors to monitor, to finance and to effectively implement management practices and measures for the protection of water sources. We propose seven case studies involving multiple actors in implementing good practices (land management, farming, product stewardship, point source pollution prevention) to ensure safe drinking water supply. The seven case studies cover different pedo-climatic conditions, different types of farming systems, different legal frameworks, larger and smaller water collection areas across the EU. In close cooperation with actors in the field in the case studies (farmers associations, local authorities, water producing companies, private water companies, consumer organisations) and other stakeholders (fertilizer and plant protection industry, environment agencies, nature conservation agencies, agricultural administrations) at local and EU level, WATERPROTECT will develop innovative water governance models investigating alternative pathways from focusing on the ‘costs of water treatment’ to ‘rewarding water quality delivering farming systems’. Water governance structures will be built upon cost-efficiency analysis related to mitigation and cost-benefit analysis for society, and will be supported by spatially explicit GIS analyses and predictive models that account for temporal and spatial scaling issues. The outcome will be improved participatory methods and public policy instruments to protect drinking water resources.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: VISMEM - Visualising memories of violence in urban places: gender and wellbeing in Istanbul Abstract: Evidence shows that violence in urban areas affects women of all ages, socio economic and cultural backgrounds in particular (WHO 2014). The immediate and extensive costs of violence targeting women perpetuate the existing gender hierarchies by setting boundaries on women’s movement, mobility, presence: that is, on their use of urban space. In addition to restrictions in mainstream social life, gendered violence is a systemic source of experiencing helplessness, humiliation, and distress which overall are a fundamental component of women’s wellbeing. VISMEM will investigate the impact of place-based memories of violence among diverse women for their use of urban space, and interrogate the utility of visual methods for understanding that impact. More precisely, the study uses visual methods to explore diverse women’s everyday negotiations of space in Istanbul, focusing in particular on their movements in relation to three research sites where forms of violence against women have occurred. VISMEM’s overall objective is to develop a conceptual framework and visual tools for multisector policy and research engagement with memory as a key means to locate, assess, and ameliorate women's differential experience of violence and wellbeing in the city. Women in different social and spatial settings remember (and forget) the physical and mental effects of violence through personal experience and through popular accounts of its effects. The differential workings of memory in turn have implications on the lived experiences and wellbeing of a city's current (and future) residents/visitors. Yet, the nexus of memory, place, gender remains disconnected from the multisector urban agenda on difference, inclusion, and wellbeing. VISMEM will provide transferable knowledge and policy-related results on the relation between gendered violence, memory, and will greatly improve our understanding of place memory as a focus in achieving gender-goals in urban social and spatial integration.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: RECAP - Reliable Capacity Provisioning and Enhanced Remediation for Distributed Cloud Applications Abstract: Large-scale computing systems are today built as distributed systems (for reasons of scale, heterogeneity, cost and energy efficiency) where components and services are distributed and accessed remotely through clients and devices. In some systems, in particular latency-sensitive or high availability systems, components are also placed closer to end-users (in, e.g., radio base stations and other systems on the edge of access networks) in order to increase reliability and reduce latency - a style of computing often referred to as edge or fog computing.
However, while recent years have seen significant advances in system instrumentation as well as data centre energy efficiency and automation, computational resources and network capacity are often provisioned using best effort provisioning models and coarse-grained quality of service (QoS) mechanisms, even in state-of-the-art data centres. These limitations are seen as a major hindrance in the face of the coming evolution of(IoT and the networked society, and have even today manifested in, e.g., a limited cloud adoption of systems with high reliability requirements such as telecommunications infrastructure and emergency services systems.
RECAP goes beyond the current state of the art and develop the next generation of cloud/edge/fog computing capacity provisioning via targeted research advances in cloud infrastructure optimization, simulation and automation. Building on advanced machine learning, optimization and simulation techniques. The overarching result of RECAP is the next generation of agile and optimized cloud computing systems. The outcomes of the project will pave the way for a radically novel concept in the provision of cloud services, where services are instantiated and provisioned close to the users that actually need them by self-configurable cloud computing systems.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: OPTEMUS - Optimised Energy Management and Use Abstract: Optimised energy management and use (OPTEMUS) represents an opportunity for overcoming one of the biggest barriers towards large scale adoption of electric and plug-in hybrid cars: range limitation due to limited storage capacity of electric batteries.

Specifically, OPTEMUS intends to develop a number of innovative core technologies (Integrated thermal management system comprising the compact refrigeration unit and the compact HVAC unit, battery housing and insulation as thermal and electric energy storage, thermal energy management control unit, regenerative shock absorbers) and complementary technologies (localised conditioning, comprising the smart seat with implemented TED and the smart cover panels, PV panels) combined with intelligent controls (eco-driving and eco-routing strategies, predictive cabin preconditioning strategy with min. energy consumption, electric management strategy).  

The combined virtual and real-life prototyping and performance assessment in a state of the art, on-the-market A-segment electric vehicle (Fiat 500e) of this package of technologies will allow demonstrating a minimum of 32% of energy consumption reduction for component cooling and 60% for passenger comfort, as well as an additional 15% being available for traction, leading to an increase of the driving range in extreme weather conditions of at least 44 km (38%) in a hot ambient (+35ºC and 40% rH) and 63 km (70%) in a cold ambient (-10ºC and 90% rH).","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: FunMagResBeacons - Functionalized Magnetic Resonance Beacons for Enhanced Spectroscopy and Imaging Abstract: ""This project will develop and demonstrate molecular agents called functional magnetic resonance beacons (fMRBs). These will provide a new set of versatile spectroscopic tools for the spatially resolved study of chemistry, biochemistry, diffusion, flow and percolation inside opaque objects. The fMRB agents support hyperpolarized nuclear spin order, which generates enormously enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. The agents are designed to maintain such order for long times (between 5 minutes and several hours) in ambient temperature solution, enabling their transport deep inside opaque objects. The molecules are functionalized, so that they “light up"""" in an NMR or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment, upon triggering by specific chemical signals or physical conditions (sensory functionality), and may also to bind to selected molecular targets (binding functionality). One set of proposed realisations possesses “lock-and-key” functionality, meaning that the hyperpolarized nuclear spin order is “locked” into a form which is invisible in the NMR spectrometer, but which may be “unlocked” at any chosen time by applying a suitable radiofrequency pulse sequence. The following molecular moieties are proposed as storage modules: (1) molecular cages, such as functionalized C60 fullerenes, encapsulating noble gas atoms such as 3He; (2) spin clusters supporting long-lived states, such as pairs of 13C or 15N nuclei, in shielded molecular environments. The sensory moieties include tailored peptide sequences, which may be activated by the presence of particular proteases, while binding modules include moieties such as biotin. The agents are designed to be conveniently transportable in a hyperpolarized state. Potential long-term applications include in vivo molecular imaging by MRI.

"Title: ULTRAWAVE - Ultra capacity wireless layer beyond 100 GHz based on millimeter wave Traveling Wave Tubes Abstract: For the first time, smartphones and tablets data usage exceeds desktops. This is a wake up call for manufacturers and operators to provide users with ubiquitous, high speed and high quality wireless coverage. The 5G cell densification is the only available route due to the constraints of sub-6GHz networks. A dense deployment of small cells requires a capillary backhaul and novel approaches to fronthaul. While the increase of data rate at small cell level has found solutions, the quest for high-density backhaul remains still unanswered. The fiber is too expensive and of difficult deployment. The wireless backhaul is the preferred solution for operators for performance, flexibility and cost. The traffic demand requires an upshift from microwave to high capacity millimeter wave backhaul, and overcome the current technology limits. ULTRAWAVE responds to the challenge of high capacity, high cell density backhaul by proposing, for the first time, the exploitation of the whole millimeter wave spectrum beyond 100 GHz. This will be used to create an ultra capacity layer providing more than 100 Gbps per kilometer square in Point to Multi point at D-band (141 – 174.8 GHz) over 500 m radius of coverage, fed by novel G-band (300 GHz) Point to Point high capacity links with more than 600 m range. The ULTRAWAVE system is empowered by the convergence of three main technologies: vacuum electronics, solid-state electronics and photonics in a unique wireless system, with transmission power at Watt level at millimeter waves, generated by novel traveling wave tubes. The ULTRAWAVE consortium includes five top Academic institutions and three high technology SMEs from five European countries. The vast capacity, flexibility and easy deployment of the ULTRAWAVE layer will enable backhaul of hundreds of small and pico cells, no matter the density, and will open scenarios so far not conceivable for new networks paradigms and architectures aiming at a full 5G implementation.","[""5G"", ""microwave technology"", ""mobile phones"", ""fixed wireless network""]"

The fundamental feature of the 5G-TOURS concept is the dynamic use of the network to seamlessly provide different types of services adapted to the specific needs of individual use cases. 5G-TOURS will enable different capabilities such as network slicing, virtualisation, orchestration or broadcasting as well as additional features developed by the project to bring more flexibility and improved performance. The ambition is to fully demonstrate pre-commercial 5G technologies at a large scale, showing the ability of the 5G network to meet extreme and conflicting KPIs while supporting very diverse requirements on the same infrastructure.

The 5G-TOURS mobile network system will integrate strategic components of the ecosystem, including the network infrastructure, terminals and end-devices, the vertical solutions enabled by 5G, and the vertical customers receiving the services. 5G-TOURS has devised a thorough evaluation plan to scrutinise the viability of the use cases, addressing technical performance by analysing both network service KPIs and application-level KPIs, economic impact by analysing the estimated generated revenues and, ultimately, the satisfaction of the vertical customers.","[""5G""]"
"Title: OnTrack - Development of a commercial manufacturing process for embeddable RFID and NFC Tags for complete lifecycle tracking of tyres Abstract: Europe’s tyre manufacturing and re-treading industries are under increasing threat from imported tyres mainly from China. The EU re-treading industry is valued at €1.2bn (2015) but is declining due to the influx of Chinese tyres leading to the loss of highly-skilled jobs.

The low-cost imported tyres cost on average €80 per tyre compared to €300-500 from a premium manufacturer. The temptation to buy these low-cost tyres is clear, however they are manufactured from poor quality materials with tread patterns that underperform. The ethos of cheap tyres is ‘use and replace’, whereas premium tyres are built to be re-treaded to increase lifetime. As a result, imported tyres are not cost effective over the lifetime of the tyres due to poor fuel economy and performance. Use of premium tyres and re-treading over the use and replace model needs to be encouraged to increase safety and fuel efficiency.

Silent Sensors are an innovative IoT company that are working on a tyre traceability solution to remove the logistical burden of re-treading for FOs. We are manufacturing UHF/NFC RFID tags ‘OnTrack’ to embed directly into tyres which provides each tyre with a permanent, unique ID for life. Our tags can store data from the manufacturing process and key events during operational use such as repairs etc. This comprehensive history for each tyre makes it easier for FOs to plan their tyre re-treads. This data also makes the re-tread process simpler as the tyre history will speed-up integrity tests.

OnTrack is the only tyre traceability solution that offers NFC – empowering employees to interrogate tyres with just a smartphone. We have a clear market opportunity with OnTrack to supply up to 40m tags/annum to a single tyre manufacturer. Based on our 7-year cumulative total gross profits of €44.9m post-project, the 7-year ROI is 5.44:1 with a payback period of 40 months. The Internal Rate of Return is 45% and NPV of 7-year Operating Profits is €11.2m (assuming a 3% discount rate).","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: CHARISMA - Converged Heterogeneous Advanced 5G Cloud-RAN Architecture for Intelligent and Secure Media Access Abstract: CHARISMA proposes an intelligent hierarchical routing and paravirtualised architecture that unites two important concepts: devolved offload with shortest path nearest to end-users and an end-to-end security service chain via virtualized open access physical layer security (PLS). The CHARISMA architecture meets the goals of low-latency (<1ms) and security required for future converged wireless/wireline advanced 5G networking. This provides a cloud infrastructure platform with increased spectral and energy efficiency and enhanced performance targeting the identified needs for 1000-fold increased mobile data volume, 10-100 times higher data rates, 10-100 times more connected devices and 5x reduced latency. 

Fully aligned and committed to the 5G-PPP principles and KPIs, the CHARISMA proposal brings together 10G-wireless (via mm-wave/60-GHz & free-space optics, FSO) access and 100G fixed optical (OFDM-PON) solutions through an intelligent cloud radio-access-network (C-RAN) and intelligent radio remote head (RRH) platform with IPv6 Trust Node routing featuring very low-latency for the traffic management. Low-cost Ethernet is used across front- and backhaul, and end-user equipment (vCPE), and intelligence distributed across the back-, front-hauls, and perimetric data transports. Ad-hoc mobile device interconnectivities (D2D, D2I, C2C etc.), content delivery network (CDN) and mobile distributed caching (MDC) offer an energy-efficient (better than x20 improvement possible) information-centric networking (ICN) architecture. Furthermore, caching will provide efficient utilization of scarce resources by early aggregating data or/and by executing communication locally. 

The CHARISMA approach will benefit user experiences with ground-breaking low-latency services, high-bandwidth, and mobile cloud resilient network security.","[""5G""]"
"Title: FUTEBOL - FUTEBOL: Federated Union of Telecommunications Research Facilities for an EU-Brasil Open Laboratory Abstract: FUTEBOL composes a federation of research infrastructure in Europe and Brazil, develops a supporting control framework, and conducts experimentation-based research in order to advance the state of telecommunications through the investigation of converged optical/wireless networks. Current wireless trends (cell densification, coordinated communication, massive MIMO) pose a new set of challenges that require the joint consideration of optical and wireless network architectures. These problems are of direct impact to emerging economies such as Brazil, with highly heterogeneous infrastructure capabilities and demand, as well as to more established markets such as the EU, which aims to regain its leadership in the next generation of telecommunication technologies. FUTEBOL establishes the research infrastructure to address these research challenges through innovation over this infrastructure, with a consortium of leading industrial and academic telecommunications institutions. In this capacity, the methodology of the FUTEBOL project is organized into three steps: i) the composition of federated research infrastructure suited for integrated optical/wireless experimentation, ii) the development of a converged control framework to support experimentation on the federated research infrastructure, and iii) the direct advancement of telecommunications through research using the developed research infrastructure and control framework. The steps of FUTEBOL relate to one another in a layered manner: the end-user driven advancement of telecommunications relies on the development of the FUTEBOL converged control framework, which, in turn, requires the composition of federated research infrastructure. In this way, FUTEBOL directly addresses the agreed priority areas of Brazil and Europe cooperation to guide future innovation in the area of ICT. By leveraging and extending the prior work of the FIRE programme and FIBRE project, FUTEBOL expedites industry-centric innovation.","[""5G"", ""optical networks"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: RISEN - Rail Infrastructure Systems Engineering Network Abstract: Social and economic growth, security and sustainability in Europe are at risk of being compromised due to aging and failing railway infrastructure systems. This partly reflects a recognised skill shortage in railway infrastructure engineering. This project, RISEN, aims to enhance knowledge creation and transfer using both international and intersectoral secondment mechanisms among European Advanced Rail Research Universities/SMEs and Non-EU, world-class rail universities including the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (USA), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA), Southwest Jiaotong University (China), Tsinghua University (China), University of California Berkeley (USA), Railway Technical Research Institute (Japan), University of Sao Paulo (Brazil), Iranian University of Science and Technology (Iran), Chulalongkorn University (Thailand), and University of Wollongong (Australia).

"Title: Didimo - Humanity in Digital Communication Abstract: Every minute, people across the world are making billions of virtual connections –for work, for entertainment, for information and for social communication. However, most of these interactions are still missing core human attributes – such as emotion, empathy, and nuance – that are critical to connection and understanding. Creating realistic avatars is hard and until today it has required large production teams of experienced artists, engineers and expensive software, being almost exclusively domain of Hollywood and AAA games.
All of the market conditions are present to create authentic virtual interactions through 3D avatars, but until now, there was no scalable way to deliver them. Didimo is the leading creator of high-fidelity digital humans – “didimo”. Our technology brings authenticity to virtual interactions. Didimo streamlines the production of characters at scale. From a single smartphone photo or scan our software creates a ready-to-animate avatar shortening the production process from hundreds of hours (at least 420) to less than a minute (30 seconds!).
Our software automates all stages of character creation into a one-click experience seamlessly embedded in our partners' apps. By integrating our software, in just a few seconds, our customers can deliver to their users a digital version of themselves – their “didimos”, that look, speak, and act like them – for use in a range of mixed reality experiences.
This 3D virtual self will be available to use in any digital environment, to improve everyday online interaction for all users, and to go one step further to address the pain points specific to online businesses and their customers. Particularly, the financial losses due to product returns, resulting from the impossibility to try fashion items, affecting the retail sector; and the costs and time to generate 3D contents, affecting the mobile sector.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: GLYCOSENSE - Polymer brush sensing arrays for the identification of pathogens Abstract: Surfaces with the capacity for selective recognition of particular pathogens would offer great potential in a number of biomedical applications, including diagnostic devices. Mammalian cells are decorated with a carbohydrate-rich layer, the glycocalyx, which facilitates cellular recognition. Carbohydrate-binding proteins can interact with these sugar motifs to facilitate highly selective recognition, a strategy which is exploited by many viral and bacterial pathogens. Such species have evolved to display recognition units on their surfaces which may interact with considerable affinity with glycan structures displayed on cellular surfaces. This molecular recognition constitutes a key step in the processes of infection or toxicity, and is therefore an attractive target for the development of diagnostic devices. In this project, Dr Clare Mahon proposes to develop surface-tethered polymer brushes which will mimic the glycocalyx in terms of facilitating adhesion of pathogens. Through the incorporation of different fluorophores, the surfaces will be used to construct sensing arrays which will enable the rapid and cost-effective identification of water-borne pathogens and common respiratory pathogens.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: COIN - Coding for Optical communications In the Nonlinear regime Abstract: The rapid increase in data traffic in the past years and traffic forecasts will lead to capacity exhaust in the optical fibre communications infrastructure which carries over 95% of all data services. The optical fibre channel is nonlinear, that is, its properties, namely its refractive index, is dependent on optical intensity, and at high power densities, the combination of nonlinear effects and dispersion leads to nonlinear distortion, limiting both achievable capacities, spectral efficiencies and distances. A key research area requiring investigation is nonlinear coding and detection, tailored to the nonlinear channel to dramatically improve the data throughput of future optical networks. New R&D is critically needed not only for finding new native nonlinear communication techniques but also transferring them into practical, error-resilient systems. The COIN objective is, thus, the development of a new area of nonlinear communications including forward error correction, essential for reliable communication. Specifically, COIN will investigate the application of nonlinear Fourier transforms and nonlinearity-tailored coding and detection by effectively integrating the scientific expertise of the key academic research groups in information theory, coding, coherent optical communication and high-speed transmission with the industrial know-how of the consortium. The COIN R&D goals will be to focus on the development of new, native communication schemes and waveforms alongside with the development of coding schemes for these and existing non-linear Fourier transform based transceivers. The R&D tasks will be carried out along with researcher training in the leading scientific centres in Europe. The PhD training programme is designed to maximize the unique synergy between the collaborators to promote career opportunities of the COIN researchers in ICT, generating new types of key expertise and and human capital for the European Research Area.","[""optical networks""]"
"Title: DIOR - DIOR: Deep Intelligent Optical and Radio  Communication Networks Abstract: Communication networks play a vital role in the technological infrastructure underpinning Internet traffic applications. Service providers and researchers worldwide are sparing no effort to increase the information capacity and security of telecommunication networks to support the demands of high-speed, reliable and secure emerging internet, data centre, cloud computing, 5G new radio and IoT systems, especially since the outbreak of Coronavirus. Applications such as intelligent transportation, signal processing ubiquitous low-latency connectivity and massive connected objects, have raised challenges for backbone and access networks that are often underpinned by optical, radio or hybrid networks. Artificial intelligent (AI) technologies appear an innovative and promising solution to cope with emerging challenges in optical/wireless/hybrid networks, in which the underlying physics, mathematics and optimisation of problems are non-deterministic to analyse or impossible to describe explicitly. In this proposed research, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques such as neural networks, clustering and regression will be exploited in optical/wireless/hybrid networks to mitigate stochastic distortions, to predict network conditions and to maximise network capacity. This DIOR proposal aims to unite optical/radio network research and AI technologies for tackling emerging challenges.

"Title: QUARTET - Quantum readout techniques and technologies Abstract: The general aim of this proposal is to exploit quantum information to develop new powerful methods for the retrieval and recognition of classical data from physical systems. More precisely, we aim at showing a substantial quantum-enhancement in several fundamental tasks: (1) the readout of classical data from digital memories (quantum reading); (2) the recognition of classical patterns (quantum pattern recognition); (3) the optical measurement of concentration in fragile biomedical samples (quantum bio-probing); and (4) the microwave detection of target objects (microwave quantum illumination or quantum radar). These objectives are realized starting from the optimization of a general theoretical model at their basis: quantum channel discrimination. This is then developed into technical aspects which directly support our experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations.

Our experimental prototypes could open the way to much more powerful and radically new forms of information and detection technologies, with direct benefit for science and the wider society. Thanks to the superior performances in the low energy regime, quantum reading may increase data-transfer rates and storage capacities of current digital memories by orders of magnitude. Quantum pattern recognition could have remarkable long-term applications in biology and medicine, in terms of non-invasive analysis of very fragile biological samples or human tissues, and better recognizing hidden patterns associated to bacterial growths or cancerous cells. Such results could provide future non-invasive techniques of medical imaging for private and public hospitals. Finally, the realization of a working prototype of a quantum radar may have non-trivial applications for the European security technology.","[""radar""]"
"Title: STEVE - Smart-Taylored L-category Electric Vehicle demonstration in hEtherogeneous urbanuse-cases Abstract: Movement is at the heart of any city. Urban mobility faces significant challenges from two global megatrends: growing urbanisation and ageing population. Light electric vehicles (EL-Vs) could represent a viable solution to traffic congestion and pollution in cities. However, their successful integration into the urban transport system requires a clear understanding of the individual consumer needs.
By involving human science and transportation specialists, the STEVE partners have developed a framework to interpret these forces. Focus will be on mature cities of medium size (Torino: 800.000 inhabitants, Villach 60.000, Calvià 60.000, Venaria 35.000), where STEVE will generate data to support the design of next generation EL Vs, and provoke the mind-shift necessary for swift market penetration of them.

The primary idea of STEVE is to implement and test a human-centric approach to electro-Mobility-as-a-Service (eMaaS), according to the “Move2Me” vision of the consortium. This will provide low-cost and financially sustainable EL V solutions and “gamified” services, to enhance users’ awareness, engagement and vehicle energy efficiency.
A core item of STEVE is a low-cost electric quadricycle developed by a worldwide OEM in Turin, with start-of-production expected in 2018 at a market price of €8000. The quadricycle will integrate high-technology contents with respect to the current competitors, and will be pilot-tested, together with many other EL-Vs, during extensive demonstration phases in the four STEVE cities
STEVE will guarantee a strong impact in terms of business development and jobs, and enhance the European competitiveness in the eMaaS sector while also leveraging Manufacturing.

The consortium will also give a primary role to SMEs: while large enterprises will provide the underlying technologies, the services will be mainly designed and operated by SMEs, deeply involved in the local supply chains and adaptable to the specific customers’ needs.","[""mobile network""]"
"Title: FreeWheel - Lifecycle-reconfigurable Smart Mobility Platform to enable autonomous and cost-effective personalized solutions for social inclusion of disabled and elderly while leveraging AM technologies Abstract: FreeWheel promotes social inclusion of disabled and elderly people through a urban mobility solution consisting of a unit integrating an autonomous “smart active” module, multiple custom interfaces and an app. Such a solution can be either rented (a sharing service available at in-door and out-door urban facilities), or sold; in the latter case the unit includes a fully personalized wheelchair. 

FreeWheel satisfies the need for customization, both on the user and on the vehicle side, through the implementation of a modular concept based on standard reconfigurable, low-cost modules (e.g. engine, gears, control unit, HMI, etc.) and on ultra-customized interfaces (e.g. body-to-vehicle, engine-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, etc.), produced via additive manufacturing. Re-configurability is achieved through an easy exchange of standard modules in different products. 

A further objective is making affordable the lifecycle cost of the above-mentioned mobility service (and/or product) through an innovative business model that offers mobility as a service (independent of vehicle ownership) and by leveraging dematerialization (reduction of manufacturing lead times and investment costs) and product re-configurability. 

The expected impact is:
-	Social inclusion of elderly and disabled citizens: the project will demonstrate affordability and safety in accessing public spaces in urban areas;
-	Short time-to-market: 70% less than the conventional approach. 
-	Significant cost reduction in the manufacturing of a personalised wheelchair unit as a result of the re-usability and adaptability of personalised products components; 
-	Ultra-low environmental impact: re-usability of modules and efficient manufacturing leading to more than 70% in environmental impact reduction regarding primary resources consumed while offering this mobility service.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: 5G-RECORDS - 5G key technology enableRs for Emerging media COntent pRoDuction Services Abstract: 5G-RECORDS aims to explore the opportunities which new 5G technology components bring to the professional audio-visual content production. 5G-RECORDS targets the development, integration, validation and demonstration of 5G components for professional media content production, as part of an overall ecosystem representing a subset of 5G network functions. The project will take a business-to-business (B2B) perspective, where 5G becomes part of the audio-visual (AV) infrastructure backbone. The challenge is to use 5G components from previous 5G-PPP projects and earlier R&D investments and further develop them. These components will be evaluated in specific end-to-end 5G infrastructures. In particular, the project will provide three end-to-end 5G infrastructures. This includes the core network (5GC), radio access network (RAN) and end devices. The project aims to use of non-public networks (NPNs) as a way to bring these new components to emerging markets and new market actors. NPNs can be deployed as independent and standalone 5G networks or in conjunction with a public network.
To ensure the successful demonstration of these use cases, the project brings together a set of experienced partners whose expertise covers both 5G and content production value chains. Most of the 5G components will be developed and implemented by a specific key partner, being mostly innovative SMEs. The presence of SMEs is particularly strong in the consortium, since they represent the 44.5%. The 5G-RECORDS implemented technologies will be based on existing 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 specifications, while also prototyping some emerging Rel-17 capabilities. All technology components are expected to reach by the end of the project a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7. 5G-RECORDS has considered 3 use cases to embrace some of the most challenging scenarios in the framework of professional content production: live audio production, a multi-camera wireless studio and live immersive media production.","[""5G""]"
"Title: SmartPhoneSmartAging - Smartphones, Smart Ageing and mHealth Abstract: This project will investigate fundamental changes in people’s relationship to age and health associated with the global rise of the smartphone. The aim is to combine an intellectual challenge in understanding the contemporary nature of age and the impact of new media, with an applied challenge to use this knowledge to help make mHealth a more effective intervention. 
Through simultaneous 15 month ethnographies in China, Japan, Iran, Ireland, Nigeria and Tanzania (and supplementary work in Trinidad) a team will explore the experience of age for those between 45-70 i.e. neither clearly young nor elderly, who represent an unprecedented population that has resulted from changed life expectancy and changed aspirations. We will examine how this shift in the experience of age is impacted by the rise of smartphones that bring access to technologies associated with the young. mHealth started with youth orientated issues of fitness and wellbeing but is increasingly becoming a significant intervention in helping older populations deal with disease and frailties. mHealth has potential both for helping those with low access to professional care but also threatens to bypass and undermine professional medical services. Our aim is to complement technology led mHealth interventions with ethnography led participatory design, consisting of a collaboration between mHealth professionals with our ethnographically informed team and our informants.
The applied anthropology will inform our intellectual advances in the field of digital anthropology. Reflections on mHealth will contribute to the core aim of advancing our understanding of the experience of age in this new interstitial period of life, and to appreciate the major transformations in society and sociality represented by the new ubiquity of the smartphone. Both the intellectual and applied components will be shown to depend upon sensitivity to the forms of cultural diversity uncovered by our comparative ethnographic approach.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: SONATA - Service Programing and Orchestration for Virtualized Software Networks Abstract: Virtualisation and software networks are a major disruptive technology for communications networks, enabling services to be deployed as software functions running directly in the network on commodity hardware. However, deploying the more complex user-facing applications and services envisioned for 5G networks presents significant technological challenges for development and deployment. SONATA addresses both issues.

For service development, SONATA provides service patterns and description techniques for composed services. A customised SDK is developed to boost the efficiency of developers of network functions and composed services, by integrating catalogue access, editing, debugging, and monitoring analysis tools with service packaging for shipment to an operator.

For deployment, SONATA provides a novel service platform to manage service execution. The platform complements the SDK with functionality to validate service packages. Moreover, it improves on existing platforms by providing a flexible and extensible orchestration framework based on a plugin architecture. Thanks to SONATA’s platform service developers can provide custom algorithms to steer the orchestration of their services: for continuous placement, scaling, life-cycle management and contextualization of services. These algorithms are overseen by executives in the service platform, ensuring trust and resolving any conflict between services.

By combining rapid development and deployment in an open and flexible manner, SONATA is realising an extended DevOps model for network stakeholders.

SONATA validates its approach through novel use-case-driven pilot implementations and disseminates its results widely by releasing its key SDK and platform components as open source software, through scientific publications and standards contributions, which, together, will have a major impact on incumbent stakeholders including network operators and manufacturers and will open the market to third-party developers.","[""5G""]"

Based on stakeholder identification and needs assessment the project consortium will develop an elaborated and legally solid toolbox which will assist public procurers to inform themselves about BBPS and ultimately provide all relevant information to prepare an actual tender. The toolbox will be used for capacity building activities including trainings for public procurers and decision makers, market dialogues and exchanges with standardization experts. It will furthermore be presented in an online decision support tool and a multilingual handbook. The workshop and dialogue concept for trainings  can subsequently be used throughout Europe.
Recommendations for decision makers and standardization bodies on how to support PPI of BBPS in order to boost innovation in Europe’s bioeconomy will be provided. Feasibility of an cross-national buyers group of public procurers on the innovation procurement of BBPS will be assessed. 
Based on a dissemination and exploitation strategy, project results will be communicated through various channels to the relevant target groups (public procurers, public decision makers, business, standardization bodies and NGOs). 
Specific groups will be set up on the Procurement Forum (www.procurement-forum.eu).  The community will be one channel to share and distribute project results. 
Via the integration of the project and its products into the existing Procurement of Innovation Platform (https://www.innovation-procurement.org/), the project results will be sustainable. Integration of the bio-based products section is a win-win situation for the existing platform and for the bio-based products sector who as a newcomer can profit from existing infrastructure and knowledge.","[""telecommunications networks""]"
"Title: CARAMEL - Artificial Intelligence based cybersecurity for connected and automated vehicles Abstract: The damaging effects of cyberattacks to an industry like the Cooperative Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) can be tremendous. From the least important to the worst ones, one can mention for example the damage in the reputation of vehicle manufacturers, the increased denial of customers to adopt CCAM, the loss of working hours (having direct impact on the European GDP), material damages, increased environmental pollution due e.g., to traffic jams or malicious modifications in sensors’ firmware, and ultimately, the great danger for human lives, either they are drivers, passengers or pedestrians. CARAMEL’s goal is to proactively address modern vehicle cybersecurity challenges applying advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and also to continuously seek methods to mitigate associated safety risks.

In order to address cybersecurity considerations for the already here autonomous and connected vehicles, well established methodologies coming from the ICT sector will be adopted, allowing to assess vulnerabilities and potential cyberattack impacts. Although past initiatives and cybersecurity projects related to the automotive industry have reached to security assurance frameworks for networked vehicles, several newly introduced technological dimensions like 5G, autopilots, and smart charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) introduce cybersecurity gaps, not addressed satisfactorily yet. Considering the entire supply chain of automotive operations, CARAMEL targets to reach to commercial anti-hacking IDS/IPS products for the European automotive cybersecurity and to demonstrate their value through extensive attack and penetration scenarios.","[""5G""]"

"Title: ENVISION - Enhanced Situational Awareness through Video Integration with ADS-B Surveillance Infrastructure on Airports Abstract: The constant growth of air traffic will put regional and local airports under ever more pressure for increasing their capacity. However, safety and efficiency gains allowed by the deployment of A-SMGCS systems currently remain out of most small to medium size platforms’ reach because of prohibitive infrastructure costs. Due to the intrinsic attributes of current surveillance technologies and airport surface coverage constraints, airports are required to deploy complex and costly infrastructures involving multiple sensors of different kinds: ADS-B, MLAT, SMR.

ENVISION is an ATM application-oriented research project, under the SESAR 2020 Programme “Enabling Aviation Infrastructure: CNS” topic which aims at making use of technical progress in CCTV cameras, LIDAR technology and image processing techniques, and at taking advantage of reduced equipment costs, to provide regional and local airports safe and affordable surface movements surveillance capabilities for ATC and A-CDM services.

In a stepwise approach, in two airports, the consortium will evaluate and demonstrate the operational, technical and economic feasibility of implementing CCTV and LIDAR technology in complement of ADS-B on the airport surface in providing identification and positioning data in A-SMGCS.

"Title: B5G-OPEN - Beyond 5G – OPtical nEtwork coNtinuum Abstract: B5G-OPEN targets the design, prototyping and demonstration of a novel end-to-end integrated packet-optical transport architecture based on MultiBand (MB) optical transmission and switching networks. MB expands the available capacity of optical fibres, by enabling transmission within S, E, and O bands, in addition to commercial C and/or C+L bands, which translates into a potential 10x capacity increase and low-latency for services beyond 5G. 
To realize multiband networks, technology advances are required, both in data, control and management planes. Concerning devices, these include new amplifiers, filterless subsystems, add/drop multiplexers, etc. Such technology advances complement novel packet-optical white boxes using flexible sliceable Bandwidth Variable Transceivers and novel pluggable optics. The availability of MB transmission will also lead to a complete redesign of the end-to-end architecture, removing boundaries between network domains and reducing electronic intermediate terminations. 
The control plane will be extended to support multiband elements and a ‘domain-less’ network architecture. It will rely on physical layer abstraction, new impairment modelling, and pervasive telemetry data collection to feed AI/ML algorithms that will lead to a Zero-Touch networking paradigm including a full featured node operating system for packet-optical whiteboxes. 
The results will be shown in two final demonstrations exposing the project benefits from operator and user perspectives. B5G-OPEN will have a clear impact on the society showing the evolution towards a world with increased needs of connectivity and higher capacity in support of new B5G services and new traffic patterns.

"Title: SMARTRange - A disruptive wireless transceiver chip to transform the Internet of Things (IoT) by delivering excellent range, ultra-low power, high security, high reliability and cost-effective connectivity. Abstract: Part of the 4th Industrial Revolution, the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a global growth opportunity. In particular, the IoT offers tremendous socio-economic and environmental benefits through the improved automation and energy efficiency of Smart Homes, Buildings and Industrial Plants.

Most IoT applications demand that devices provide the range of WiFi. In addition, devices must be standards-based, highly secure, globally interoperable, reliable, ultra-low power and cost effective.

However, existing IoT technology is failing to meet these market needs. Current 2.4GHz radios have limited range and sub-GHz radios do not give security or global interoperability. 

There are two ways to increase the range of radio devices: 1) increase transmit power or 2) improve the radio’s receiver sensitivity (Rx sensitivity). However, legislation in Europe limits transmit power to 10dBm, meaning the only practical way to increase range is to improve Rx sensitivity. 

Cascoda has developed a disruptive 2.4GHz wireless transceiver based on a unique patent-protected radio architecture, which significantly improves Rx sensitivity, effectively doubling the range without using any external power amplifiers. This delivers the range of WiFi to provide whole-house coverage, reduces power consumption by a factor of 6 enabling years of operation from batteries, provides high security, reliability and reduces equipment costs by a factor 5 as no power amplifiers are needed. 

Extensive R&D and market feasibility studies including a Eureka Eurostars and a H2020 Phase 1 project, have taken us this far. This Phase 2 project will allow us to optimise, refine and certify our products under industry standards and demonstrate our systems under real-world conditions. This project enables us to enter the low-power wireless market worth at least €3 billion. By 2025, we will cumulatively generate €48 million in revenues and €27 million in operating profits and help create up to 184 skilled jobs.","[""radio technology""]"

The project will drive the UAV verticals and 5G networks to a win-win position, on one hand by showing that 5G is able to guarantee UAV vertical KPIs, and on the other hand by demonstrating that 5G can support challenging use-cases that put pressure on network resources, such as low-latency and reliable communication, massive number of connections and high bandwidth requirements, simultaneously. 5G!Drones will build on top of the 5G facilities provided by the ICT-17 projects and a number of support sites, while identifying and developing the missing components to trial UAV use-cases. The project will feature Network Slicing as the key component to simultaneously run the three types of UAV services on the same 5G infrastructure (including the RAN, back/fronthaul, Core), demonstrating that each UAV application runs independently and does not affect the performance of other UAV applications, while covering different 5G services. While considering verticals will be the main users of 5G!Drones, the project will build a software layer to automate the run of trials that exposes a high level API to request the execution of a trial according to the scenario defined by the vertical, while enforcing the trial’s scenario using the API exposed by the 5G facility, as well as the 5G!Drones enablers API deployed at the facility. Thus, 5G!Drones will enable abstracting all the low-level details to run the trials for a vertical and aims at validating 5G KPIs to support several UAV use-cases via trials using a 5G shared infrastructure, showing that 5G supports the performance requirements of UAVs with several simultaneous UAV applications with different characteristics (eMBB, uRLLC and mMTC).

"Title: FIWIN5G - FIber-Wireless Integrated Networks for 5th Generation delivery. Abstract: This European Training Network aims to produce the next generation of early stage researchers who will enable Europe to take a leading role in the development of future devices, systems and networks supporting the 5G high-speed wireless internet. To do this, researchers must be able to work in interdisciplinary teams, integrate their activities, share expertise, and promote a vision of a converged wireless and optical devices and networks that efficiently supports the services and applications being demanded. A large number of technologies and devices will need to converge, co-exist and interoperate, and most importantly, cooperate, if this vision is to be efficiently and cost-effectively realised. A key area within this next generation jigsaw is the integration of optical fibre networks and radio networks at mm-wave frequencies, to provide high-bandwidth front/backhaul services and enable scalable and manageable networks without a highly complex interface structure and multiple overlaid protocols.

FIWIN5G aims to provide doctoral students with the exposure to the range of skills, necessary to address these challenging demands. Deep technical knowledge but also key transferable skills common in entrepreneurship, management, financing as well as communication, and societal outreach. While becoming expects in one particular sub-domain, they must understand the broad context of their work, whether it is systems/network engineers understanding the devices and technologies that make up the networks or device engineers understanding the networks in which their devices will function.

We draw together a range of world-leading partners, selected for their complimentary and excellence to offer a vital opportunity to advance industry’s understanding and uptake of the key technologies in this area.

"Title: MULTIDRONE - MULTIple DRONE platform for media production Abstract: MULTIDRONE aims to develop an innovative, intelligent, multi-drone platform for media production to cover outdoor events, which are typically held over wide areas (at stadium/city level).  The 4-10 drone team, to be managed by the production director and crew, will have: a) increased decisional autonomy, by minimizing production crew load and interventions and b) improved robustness, security and safety mechanisms (e.g., embedded flight regulation compliance, enhanced crowd avoidance, autonomous emergency landing, communications security), enabling it to carry out its mission even against adverse conditions or crew inaction and to handle emergencies. Such robustness is particularly important, as the drone team has to operate close to crowds and may face an unexpected course of events and/or environmental hazards. Therefore, it must be contextually aware and adaptive with improved perception of crowds, individual people and other hazards. As this multi-actor system will be heterogeneous, consisting of multiple drones and the production  crew, serious human-in-the-loop issues will be addressed to avoid operator overload, with the goal of maximizing shooting creativity and productivity, whilst minimizing production costs. Overall, MULTIDRONE will boost research on multiple-actor systems by proposing novel multiple-actor functionalities and performance metrics. Furthermore, the overall multidrone system will be built to serve identified end user needs. Specifically, innovative, safe and fast multidrone audiovisual shooting will provide a novel multidrone cinematographic shooting genre and new media production techniques that will have a large impact on the financially important EU broadcasting/media industry.

"Title: HQSTS - High-Quality voice model for STatistical parametric speech Synthesis Abstract: A speech analysis/synthesis method aims at representing a speech waveform, produced by a person speaking, as a time sequence of parameters. Based on this time sequence, the speech waveform can be resynthesized. The analysis/synthesis methods are cornerstones for many speech technologies (e.g. text-to-speech, telecommunications, voice restoration). For the majority of applications, these methods need to have two key properties: (i) a high perceived quality of the speech sound, and, (ii) a statistical characterization of the parameters' sequence necessary for statistical approaches, which have attracted great interest during the last decades in speech technologies. The current analysis/synthesis methods that provide a statistical characterization exhibit however a lack of perceived quality. This issue does not pose a problem in applications designed for noisy environments (e.g. navigation devices, smart-phone applications, announcements in train stations). On the contrary, it prohibits the use of statistical approaches in quiet environments, e.g. in the music, cinema and video game industries, where the listener is fully aware of all the details of the sound. This problem is mainly due to the lack of an accurate representation of the phase information and its correlation with the amplitude information. Indeed, recent phase processing tools allowed the description of the phase spectrum properties in a way that shows the drawbacks and limits of current analysis/synthesis methods. Additionally, these same tools are also promising means for modeling the phase information, which is paramount for good quality. The primary goal of the HQSTS project is to create a high-quality analysis/synthesis method that will broaden the applications of statistical approaches of speech technologies in quiet environments, where a high-quality is an absolute necessity.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: LeviTech - Levitated particles as the heart of miniaturized sensing technologies Abstract: The phrase “no moving parts” is misleading; mechanical oscillators are the beating heart of modern technology. Whether it’s the vibration of quartz crystals setting the pace of computation, or surface acoustic wave devices amplifying signals in smartphones, mechanical oscillators are truly ubiquitous.

Micro-Electromechanical Systems, or MEMS devices, dominate research into mechanical devices with technological applications. Due to their ability to be mass fabricated, they have found applications as sensors in industries ranging from healthcare to VR gaming. 
Their sensing performance is ultimately limited by the energy they dissipate during operation, a problem which gets worse with decreasing size. LeviTech proposes a non-obvious and inventive solution: levitation of the mechanical oscillator. By physically untethering from the environment, most energy dissipation pathways are closed, leading to ultra low-dissipation in what we term L-MEMS devices. 

To lay the groundwork for technological exploitation, LeviTech outlines a programme of miniaturization of both optical and electrical trapping technologies, to an intermediate state suitable for state-of-the-art sensing, generation of IP, commercial collaboration, and potential prototyping.

LeviTech will deliver immediate technological application via beyond state-of-the-art pressure sensing, using a highly inventive technique whereby non-linear L-MEMS yields zero-dissipation sensing.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: IoT4Industry - Towards smarter means of production in European manufacturing SMEs through the use of the Internet of Things technologies Abstract: The proportion of the manufacturing industry is currently decreasing in developed European countries’ GDP. Industry 4.0 - also called smart manufacturing, digital industry or industry of the future – provides several technological responses to the challenging competitive market. Indeed, the integration of the Internet of Things and related components - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Security, Cloud Computing and Big Data - in manufacturing SMEs will improve efficiency and flexibility in production and consumption. However, it requires a more integrated and cooperative approach due to the high interdisciplinarity which has been introduced. Above all, not all manufacturing companies, and in particular SMEs, have access to smarter means of production, due to costs and efforts in the integration and implementation, possible aversion or readiness to ICT technologies, and other obstacles related to cyber and physical security.

"Title: CYTO-WATER - Integrated and portable image cytometer for rapid response to Legionella and Escherichia coli in industrial and environmental waters Abstract: The proposed project will deploy for the first time a new imaging cytometer platform capable of detecting minute quantity of micro-organisms in industrial and environmental waters. The platform is based on the integration of proprietary technologies available to the consortium partners: an automatic water concentration cartridge combined with a microfluidic cell will provide an adequate sample to a newly designed fluorescence image cytometer whose readings will be recorded and processed using a proper software interface. It will be validated for quantifying Legionella and Escherichia coli (E. coli) population within 120 minutes from obtaining the sample, overcoming in this way the main disadvantage of traditional methods used in laboratories, i.e. long time-to results which can currently last up to 12 days in the case of Legionella and 1 day for E. coli. The targeted detection limit will be 10-100 cells/L and 5-20 cells/100 mL for Legionella and E.coli, respectively. Also, the new imaging cytometer will have a portable form, a size similar to a smart-phone, which will increase its versatility and widen the possibilities of onsite applications. The relevance of the project is clear when one thinks about the high risk of legionellosis in some specific industrial environments, such as cooling waters, evaporative condensers and air conditioning systems and the fact that E. coli is one of the faecal pollution index commonly analyzed for monitoring the presence of waterborne pathogens and hence the quality of bathing waters.

"Title: BEACON - Hybrid Digital-Analog Networking under Extreme Energy and Latency Constraints Abstract: The objective of the BEACON project is to (re-)introduce analog communications into the design of modern wireless networks. We argue that the extreme energy and latency constraints imposed by the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm can only be met within a hybrid digital-analog communications framework. Current network architectures separate source and channel coding, orthogonalize users, and employ long block-length digital source and channel codes, which are either suboptimal or not applicable under the aforementioned constraints. BEACON questions these well-established design principles, and proposes to replace them with a hybrid digital-analog communications framework, which will meet the required energy and latency constraints while simplifying the encoding and decoding processes. BEACON pushes the performance of the IoE to its theoretical limits by i) exploiting signal correlations that are abundant in IoE applications, given the foreseen density of deployed sensing devices, ii) taking into account the limited and stochastic nature of energy availability due to, for example, energy harvesting capabilities, iii) using feedback resources to improve the end-to-end signal distortion, and iv) deriving novel converse results to identify fundamental performance benchmarks.

The results of BEACON will not only shed light on the fundamental limits on the performance any coding scheme can achieve, but will also lead to the development of unconventional codes and communication protocols that can approach these limits, combining digital and analog communication techniques. The ultimate challenge for this project is to exploit the developed hybrid digital-analog networking theory for a complete overhaul of the physical layer design for emerging IoE applications, such as smart grids, tele-robotics and smart homes. For this purpose, a proof-of-concept implementation test-bed will also be built using software defined radios and sensor nodes.","[""mobile network""]"

"Title: RF Beamformer - Ultra-low-cost terminals that meet the special requirements of all satellite operators allowing them to access markets currently inaccessible due to terminal economics. Abstract: Broadband has become an essential part of 21st-century infrastructure. New cloud services are making it a necessity for starting and growing small businesses, as well as advancing a wide variety of industries. However, more than half of the world's population still does not have access to internet being at a disadvantage; and the digital gap will continue to grow wider. Traditional wireless networks are expensive to install or expand and consequently low subscriber areas and less lucrative developing regions will likely never see cellular access. As an alternative, satellite access offers more than 5,000 times the spectrum compared to terrestrial networks -plus it is global and cover land, sea and air. Nevertheless, this technology is held back by current ground-based terminal (antenna) solutions that are expensive, single beam, require high power and have limited scalability.

Isotropic’s Radio Frequency (RF) Beamformer technology is a highly innovative system that exploits the science of transformational optics to provide the self-aligning ability of large phased array antennas but with significantly reduced complexity. This allows for drastically reduced cost and power consumption whilst increasing operational flexibility and performance. RF Beamformer is an ultra-low cost antenna technology that enables an optimised ground-based terminal that is otherwise currently missing in the industry development roadmap.

To date we have received $6M in venture capital and following successful results from founder´s research, the technology has reached TRL 5.

"Title: iBROW - Innovative ultra-BROadband ubiquitous Wireless communications through terahertz transceivers Abstract: The demand for broadband content and services has been growing at tremendous rates, and predictions indicate that wireless data-rates of multiple tens of Gbps will be required by the year 2020, essentially for short-range connectivity. Currently available wireless technology cannot support these future demands, and so there is an urgent need to develop new technology platforms that are cost and energy efficient to enable ubiquitous ultra-broadband wireless communications seamlessly integrated with high-speed fibre-optic networks, paving the way for 100 Gbps datarates in the long term. The frequency spectrum currently in use is not expected to be suitable to accommodate the predicted future data-rate requirements, and therefore there is a need to embrace higher frequency bands, above 60 GHz and up to 1 THz. iBROW aims at developing a novel, low cost, energy-efficient and compact ultra-broadband short-range wireless communication transceiver technology, capable of addressing predicted future network usage requirements. This will be pursued through the exploitation of Resonant Tunnelling Diode (RTD) devices which represent the fastest pure solid-state electronic devices operating at room temperature with reported working frequencies exceeding 1 THz. Through the development of a unified technology that can be integrated into both ends of the wireless link, namely consumer portable devices and fibre-optic supported base-stations, the project aims at increasing the RTD output power, optical detection efficiency and energy efficiency at target frequencies, developing a methodology for low cost RTD manufacturing on a silicon platform, photonic integration and packaging, as well as identifying appropriate communication methods and architectures to enable its deployment in 10 Gbps short-range wireless communication devices in short term and paving the way for 100 Gbps in long term for both the mm-wave and THz frequency bands, seamlessly integrated with optical fibre networks","[""radio technology""]"
"Title: INTELLICONT - Development and Manufacturing of Intelligent Lightweight Composite Aircraft Container Abstract: Air cargo has experienced tremendous growth. Essential components and open field of technological advancement are air-cargo containers (ULDs) which have not followed the technological advances of aircraft structures and systems. The faced challenges are: reduce ULD and aircraft weight; enhance container fire/smoke detection and suppression; eliminate permanent moving and locking hardware; enhance flight safety, loading/unloading logistics and maintenance.  The main goal of the proposal is to develop, manufacture and validate a new intelligent lightweight aircraft cargo container with integrated functions for restrain, transportation, fire/smoke suppression, with sensing and wireless monitoring capabilities. The outlined approach entails development of a full composite ULD, manufactured by low cost, high output methods (pultrusion, RTM). Following common certification practice, a building block approach is employed to design and validate the container. A self-moving platform allowing the motion of the ULD inside and outside the aircraft. Low-cost and low-energy sensors in the container track status (ID, location, locking state) and detect critical events, fire/smoke, impacts and accidental misuse. The status of each container will be available to the pilots though a wireless communication network, such that problems would be detected and proper measures would be taken. Lab-scale and full-scale tests are proposed for the validation of the ULD. Obtained numerical and test data will pave the routes to certification and industrialization. The ambition of the project is to provide a major break-through in the state of the art of current ULD technology and aircraft cargo operations. Substantial impact is anticipated on the CleanSky program, the reduction of aircraft payload and weight, safety, maintenance and lean aircraft operation processes. INTELLICONT will be a game changer for the air-cargo industry with substantial broader impact on air-cargo handling operations.","[""radio technology""]"

"Title: AiRT - Technology transfer of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) for the creative industry Abstract: Aerial photography and filming represent an indispensable resource for the Creative Industries (CIs). When filming in indoor environments, auxiliary devices as cable cams, camera rails, jibs, scaffolds or lifting platforms are being employed, enabling to realize special aerial camera shots.  With the rise of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), commonly known as drones, CIs are increasingly focusing on its use outdoors, providing significant advantages over current photography and filming techniques such as widening the creative possibilities and freedom of camera movement, less invasive and risky compared to auxiliary devices and affordable.

However, RPAS cannot be professionally employed indoors by the CIs. Existing RPAS lack of a precise, robust and affordable indoor positioning system (IPS) as well as advanced safety features. Without a good IPS the control of the RPAS in indoor environments is particularly difficult and even unsafe. Currently, there are three IPS suitable for RPAS, but these are too expensive (€200k), or present large limitations (e.g. sensitive to light conditions) for its usage by CI SMEs. This jeopardizes the creative possibilities of CI and their competitiveness.

Hence, the main goal of AiRT project is to provide the European CI SMEs a tool that, by expanding their creative spaces will help them to offer new services, which in turn will increase their changes to grow within the European and international market. To accomplish this objective, AiRT project will develop the world´s first indoor RPAS specifically designed for professional use by the CIs.

As a result, over 900.000 European CI firms will benefit from the transfer of the latest advances in IPS, 3D scene reconstruction, navigation and active / passive safety measures into an intelligent indoor RPAS, being able to avoid both static and dynamic objects. In addition AiRT system could be programmed in order to fly autonomously, enabling the CIs to focus on the camera control.","[""radio technology""]"

"Title: DECADE - Deploying High Capacity Dense Small Cell Heterogeneous Networks Abstract: Broadband mobile networks are experiencing exponential traffic growth. It is predicted that this trend will continue in the next five to ten years with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 0.6 to 1.0. Hence the traffic (mostly data) carried by a mobile operator’s network in 2022 could be over 1000 times of that in 2012. This traffic growth presents a huge challenge to both the mobile industry and to academic researchers.

Along with increased spectrum efficiency, spectrum bandwidth expansion and traffic offloading through WiFi, small cell deployment is regarded as one of the most promising ways to meet the use of broadband mobile service in both outdoor and in particular indoor scenarios in the next decade. The deployment of small cells in a macrocell coverage area leads to a multi-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), in which a mix of access node types, such as macrocell, femtocell and relay, will co-exist. Despite the current research and development on small cell/HetNet from both industry and academia, there are still many challenges to be addressed and questions to be answered for successful small cell and HetNet deployment. These challenges range from the lack of fundamental understanding of HetNet network capacity to the need of Radio Access Network (RAN) Planning and Optimisation (PO) tool for HetNet deployment involving both indoor and outdoor scenarios.
 
The DECADE project adopts the scheme of Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE), with the effect of inter-sectorial efforts and knowledge integration to tackle the challenges in HetNet planning and optimization. The research consists in fundamental capacity analysis, system modeling, algorithm development, and performance engineering for HetNets. In addition, DECADE serves as a solid platform to promote long-term collaboration between academia and industry collaboration in a rapidly evolving area of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Europe.","[""5G"", ""4G"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: UVMWREACT - Design, fabrication and optimization of a novel integrated UV-microwave assisted catalytic reactor for the continuous flow treatment of wastewater Abstract: UVMICROCAT uses an innovative catalytic mesh assisted by a combination of UV and microwave technology for fast and effective treatment of large volumes of wastewater for water re-use.

The project proposes an environmentally-friendly, totally innovative method for the treatment of toxic and recalcitrant contaminants in wastewater by enhancing the rate of a novel heterogeneous catalytic treatment process using microwave energy and ultraviolet radiation. The modified PAN catalysts developed at DMU has eliminated the need for iron removal post treatment and has broadened the pH range of application, whilst enabling continuous flow processes favoured by industry. In recent years, several reports have demonstrated the use of microwave and ultraviolet radiation to promote the oxidative degradation of bio-refractory wastes due to their advantages of speeding up the reaction, high-efficiency with no pollution to the environment. Nevertheless the use of microwaves in catalysis and in the water and wastewater industry remains at laboratory scale and therefore requires further in depth research. The major challenges in the water/wastewater industries are centered on the poor penetration depth of microwaves. In the project, we propose to design a UV and microwave assisted reactor which overcomes this scale-up problem. The design of the scalable microwave reactor will not only add new knowledge to the sector but open up new areas of industrial application for microwaves.","[""microwave technology""]"
"Title: selfBACK - A decision support system for self-management of low back pain Abstract: The recent global burden of disease study showed that low back pain (LBP) is the most significant contributor to disability in Europe. Most patients seen in primary care with LBP have non-specific LBP (≥85%), i.e., pain that cannot reliably be attributed to a specific disease/pathology. LBP is the fourth most common diagnosis seen in primary care (after upper respiratory infection, hypertension, and coughing). Self-management in the form of physical activity and strength/stretching exercises constitutes the core component in the management of non-specific LBP; however, adherence to self-management challenging due to lack of feedback and reinforcement. This project aims to develop a decision support system - SELFBACK - that will be used by the patient him/herself to facilitate, improve and reinforce self-management of LBP. Specifically, SELFBACK will be designed to assist the patient in deciding and reinforcing the appropriate actions to manage own LBP after consulting a health care professional in primary care. The decision support will be conveyed to the patient via a smartphone app in the form of advice for self-management. The advice will be tailored to each patient based on the symptom state, symptom progression, the patients goal-setting, and a range of patient characteristics including information from a physical activity-detecting wristband worn by the patient. The second part of the project will evaluate the effectiveness of SELFBACK in a randomized controlled trial using pain-related disability as primary outcome. We envisage that patients who use SELFBACK will have 20% reduction in pain-related disability at 9 months follow-up compared to patients receiving treatment as usual. Process evaluation will be carried out as an integrated part of the trial to document the implementation and map the patients’ satisfaction with SELFBACK. A business plan with a targeted commercialisation strategy will be developed to transfer the SELFBACK technology into the market.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: FlexTrans - a universal thin film transistor platform for flexible and curved displays Abstract: SKEM proposes a project which will accelerate the uptake of their flexible transistor platform technology (incorporating their proprietary organic semiconductor, truFLEX), into backplane drivers for the manufacture of flexible and curved electronic displays. SKEM’s technology enables the low temperature processing of high performance transistors onto plastic for the first time. This allows mechanical flexibility to be combined with electronic performance previously only demonstrated by rigid inorganics, along with significant reductions to processing costs.
This will enable SKEM’s customers to produce entirely new form factors for display-based consumer electronics: flexible, body conforming, lightweight, unbreakable devices with high resolution and low power consumption (longer battery lifetimes). This can be achieved with low risk to adoption, using refitted standard production lines. As a universal transistor platform, SKEM will supply the existing market for liquid crystal displays (LCDs), while also facilitating the new market for organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.
The project will involve customer engagement (customers are already engaged in joint development work, showing commitment with signed Letters of Intent) and commercial planning (WP2), development of the technology platform to meet customer requirements (WP3), demonstration of the technology in full display devices (WP4) and preparation for commercial roll out, involving technology transfer to industrial process lines, and scale-up of truFLEX production (WP5). A strong regime of project management (WP1) dissemination and communication (WP6) will support the aims of the project. These developments will elevate the technology from initial demonstration in the relevant industrial application (TRL6 - first LCD demonstrator completed prior to project), to full commercial readiness after the project (TRL9). SKEM will obtain EUR 200m sales by 2023 at a viable price point of EUR4,000/litre.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: DIPLOFACE - Diplomatic Face-Work - between confidential negotiations and public display Abstract: The rise of social media, coupled with intensifying demands for more transparency and democracy in world politics, brings new challenges to international diplomacy. State leaders and diplomats continue to react to traditional media, but now also attempt to present themselves proactively through tweets, public diplomacy and nation branding. These efforts often take place simultaneously and sometimes interfere directly with closed-door negotiations and its culture of restraint and secrecy. Yet the relationship between confidential diplomacy and public representation remains understudied.

DIPLOFACE will develop a sociologically and anthropologically informed approach to studying how state leaders and diplomats manage their nation’s ‘faces’ in the information age. The project will explore the relationship and tensions between confidential diplomatic negotiations and publicly displayed interventions in various media, applying the micro-sociological concept of ‘face-work’. DIPLOFACE will analyse the complex interactional dynamics that shape the diplomatic techniques and strategies used to convey a nation’s ‘face’ or ‘image of self’. Such face-work is increasingly important for national leaders and diplomats who perform simultaneously on the ‘back-stage’ and the ‘front-stage’ of international relations. DIPLOFACE will identify, theorize and analyse the repertoire of face-saving, face-honouring and face-threatening practices that are employed in confidential negotiations and in public. 
 
DIPLOFACE advances our theoretical understanding of diplomacy in the 21st century significantly beyond existing International Relations and diplomatic theory. Combining participant observation, interviews and media analysis, DIPLOFACE will generate important new knowledge about the relationship between public and confidential multilateral negotiation, how state leaders and diplomats handle new media, and the role of face-saving and face-threatening strategies in international relations.","[""radar""]"
"Title: ULTRACONTROL - Ultra-low cost orbit transfer and orbit control for future libration point missions Abstract: The key objective of this ambitious and adventurous program of research is to develop an entirely new method of spacecraft orbit transfer and orbit control using solar sails, driven only by solar radiation pressure. The new method will enable ultra-low cost libration point missions, with numerous applications in space science, Earth observation and telecommunications.

To achieve this goal, orbit transfer and orbit control for such libration point missions will be investigated using modern dynamical system theory with solar radiation pressure. This provides a key advantage over conventional thrusters, since a solar sail does not require propellant, thus reducing spacecraft mass and launch costs while significantly lengthening mission
duration. Through this programme of research, practical control strategies will be evaluated and engineering requirements
on solar sail size and performance assessed.

The programme of research will be supported by the interdisciplinary Space Glasgow Research Cluster and the host’s extensive network of international collaborators on solar sailing (ESA, NASA, NOAA). The host supervisor is the acknowledged international leader in the rapidly developing field of solar sailing. The therefore project offers a golden
opportunity to link the Experienced Research’s prior work on real-world solar sail mission operations at the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) with the host’s extensive expertise in solar sail orbital dynamics.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: A-LITHIA - Plastic nanoscale electronics via novel fabrication paradigms Abstract: Nanogap electrodes have been a highly attractive research area for over 25 years. This is mainly due to their potential for realising next generation nanodevices and circuit elements with lower power consumption, faster speed, and higher level of integration, as well as investigating the fundamental properties of materials at the nano- or even molecular level. However, the lack of a facile, inexpensive, high throughput technique for the manufacturing of dissimilar nanogap electrodes has hindered their commercial and scientific exploitation.
It is exactly at this junction that I strive to make significant advances with this proposal, by first implementing a novel patterning technique, adhesion lithography (a-Lith), to manufacture large aspect ratio (>100,000) metal electrode nanogaps (<50 nm) on a variety of substrates and then by fabricating and fully characterising nanoscale devices that will allow both understanding of the relevant device physics, alongside, advancing in device performance. 
Herein, I will firstly further develop the a-Lith key processing steps in order to establish a reliable protocol for the controlled geometry and uniform nanogap formation. Then I will follow a multidisciplinary research trajectory aiming at the development of high performance co-planar nano-scale electronic devices. Targeted proof-of-concept applications include radio frequency rectifying Schottky diodes, non-volatile ferroelectric tunnel junction memories, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, piezoelectric nanogenerators and molecular nano-junctions, the architectures and dimensions of which would be difficult or far too expensive to obtain with traditional patterning techniques (e.g. e-beam lithography). Finally, during my secondment, I will pursue the successful demonstration of fully functional non-volatile ferroelectric tunnel memory array over large area flexible substrates that will pave the way to the industrial deployment of this highly promising technology.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: SANSA - Shared Access Terrestrial-Satellite Backhaul Network enabled by Smart Antennas Abstract: The aim of SANSA project is to boost the performance of mobile wireless backhaul networks in terms of capacity and resilience while assuring an efficient use of the spectrum. Recently, a global mobile traffic increase of 11-fold between 2013 and 2018 was predicted, so novel solutions are required to avoid backhaul becoming the bottle neck of future mobile networks.  The solution envisaged in SANSA is a spectrum efficient self-reconfigurable hybrid terrestrial-satellite backhaul network based on three key principles: (i) a seamless integration of the satellite segment into terrestrial backhaul networks; (ii) a terrestrial wireless network capable of reconfiguring its topology according to traffic demands; (iii) a shared spectrum between satellite and terrestrial segments. This combination will result in a flexible solution capable of efficiently routing the mobile traffic in terms of capacity and energy efficiency, while providing resilience against link failures or congestion and easy deployment in rural areas. Therefore, we will develop novel smart antennas, dynamic radio resource management and data-based shared access techniques for enabling the spectrum sharing among both segments, as well as efficient management and routing solutions for the hybrid network. These studies will yield to the implementation and demonstration of the two key components proof of concepts:  (i) low-cost smart antennas (to be deployed in terrestrial nodes) with beam and null-steering capabilities for interference mitigation between satellite and terrestrial transceivers and network topology reconfiguration; (ii) hybrid network manager capable of controlling the resources of the hybrid network. Besides indirectly allowing the traffic increase to the mobile users, the SANSA project will set the path for a win-win collaboration between satellite and terrestrial operators that will strengthen both European sectors and also their related industries such as equipment manufacturers.","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: TCBI - Tracking children in their best interests: electronic monitoring in three European juvenile justice systems Abstract: The implementation of alternatives to deprivation of liberty throughout the juvenile justice procedure has been on the agenda of international children’s rights for about 28 years. The urgent need for alternatives is based on the requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of Child to use measures that deprive children’s liberty as last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. Accordingly, states have to develop suitable alternatives to detaining children for justice purposes. One of the currently popular alternative measures is surveillance of juvenile offenders by using electronic monitoring (EM) devices. EM ensures control through GPS or radio frequency technology, allowing juveniles to remain in or return to the community and maintain their ties with their families and peers. Although these measures seem to be popular among policy makers because of the high level of control, concerns are also raised about their harmful effects, which may be significant in childhood. 
This research investigates how the application of EM suits the requirements set out by international documents on children’s rights and how national or international policies may be improved towards a better compliance with children’s best interests. The research will be implemented in England and Wales, Hungary and The Netherlands, using a variety of qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (survey) methods to investigate the research questions. The project will generate unique knowledge on multiple aspects of using EM measures in juvenile justice, which will, for the first time, develop understanding at a European level about EM from the perspective of children. It will demonstrate a unique, children’s rights approach and involve different actors of the system, juvenile offenders and children, who will be approached via a number of channels. During the research, special attention will be paid to provide child-friendly and age-sensitive information where necessary.","[""radio frequency""]"
"Title: e-Safe - Novel low-cost ground penetrating radar system for safe, simple and swift detection of all utilities piping and cabling located underground Abstract: Across Europe and the world, the installation of underground utility services continues to grow. The ground beneath Europe’s cities streets, which already contains a myriad of pipelines and cables, is rapidly becoming over congested. For example, the city of Rome’s 3million inhabitants are serviced by 65,000km of buried pipes and cables. Due to this congestion, delivery of vital utilities through the installation and maintenance of new and existing underground services is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous. The personnel working in the various utilities sectors (telecoms, water, gas, electricity etc.) face daily challenges with regard safe excavation for installation and maintenance.

With limited utility detection solutions available on the market and the general absence of accurate underground piping and cabling records, accidents and damage to these utilities is occurring on a large scale. Maintenance contractors are causing 90,000 incidences of third party damage to EU gas pipelines alone annually. In a North American study, it was found that 25% of incidences are due to insufficient locating practice. The impact of such damage is wide-ranging; approximately 120 deaths and 6,000 serious injuries are attributed to contact with the electricity network occur in Europe every year, while repair costs for damaged services can run into many millions of euros.

The above problem demands urgent action. There is a clear need for a cost effective, rapid, compact, high performance “all services avoidance” solution that ensures the safety of utilities maintenance personnel, prevents utilities damage, and speeds up location of safe excavation zones. PipeHawk Plc has developed a totally unique system (e-Safe) that addresses all these needs. Our innovation project will bring the e-Safe system, currently at TRL6, to market readiness. We expect to capture up to 5% of the global market, generate annual profits of €16.4million, & create 70 new jobs by yr 5 post project.","[""radar""]"

"Title: realTRIPS - Redefining Variability: Evaluating Land Use and Transport Impacts on Urban Mobility Patterns Abstract: Urban mobility analysis, advanced by the emerging fine-granularity location data (e.g. smart card data, mobile phone data and social media data), has received significant attention in recent years. It has become an important subject for understanding the functionality, ever-increasing dynamism and complexity of urban space. realTRIPS aims to open a new avenue of research in urban mobility analysis using emerging automatic data by developing an analytical and modelling framework, particularly addressing variability across spatial-temporal scales. I argue that the variability of urban mobility should not be simply interpreted as a number of errors, but indicators of changes in regular human behaviours impacted by land use and transport at different scales. A deeper understanding of variability and regularity would contribute to a more accurate prediction of urban development scenarios. The relevant theories and measures on variability have been long-researched in spatial statistics, but not well applied to the context of urban mobility studies. The proposed framework will take advantage of the research progress in multi-disciplines and leverage key concepts from uncertainty in spatial analysis, time geography, and land use transport planning. Under such framework, variability will be measured in mobility patterns and integrated as a function of space and time into operational urban models for predicting impact of land use and transport on people’s travel and location choices at different spatiotemporal scales. Case studies presenting typical urban contexts (i.e. London, Shenzhen, Nairobi) will be explored to demonstrate the feasibility and generic applicability of the theory, analytical methods and urban models.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: MiRTLE - Next generation, high performance, long range, standoff, concealed threat detection system to protect European citizens and critical infrastructure Abstract: Acts of terrorism aim to instil fear into Europe's citizens. Since 2000, approximately 163,000 people have died from global terrorism. In particular, attacks against citizens and urban soft targets have increased as terrorists exploit the ability of autonomous cells and lone individuals to hit civilian targets such as concerts, markets, shopping malls, airports, transport hubs, sports stadia, cinemas, bars, night clubs and tourist resorts. Recent devastating attacks across Europe clearly illustrate the increasing threat that exists. 

It is impossible to deploy security personnel in sufficient numbers to protect every location. Even if security personnel are present they currently lack the technology to detect, at a safe range, concealed threats such as person borne improvised explosive devices (PBIEDs), guns and knives. There is an urgent and growing need for a cost effective, high performance, long range, concealed threat detection system. 

Radio Physics Solutions Ltd has developed MiRTLE (Millimetre-wave Radar Threat Level Evaluation), the world’s first, high performance, long range (up to 50m), low cost, standoff “concealed threat” detection system for the protection of citizens and critical infrastructure. MiRTLE is capable of screening large groups of people automatically and autonomously, without operator intervention, in real-time. Our highly innovative system detects PBIEDs, guns (including 3D printed) and knives up to a range of 50m in real-time, with targets in motion, all without privacy concerns. 

The overall objective of this project is to successfully refine, scale-up and demonstrate our superior technology to our customer base. We are planning to capture an 8% market share of the improvised explosive devices (IED) and weapon detection market, which will in turn generate cumulative revenues of €161m, cumulative EBITDA of €43m by 2025 and create 302 high skilled jobs in Europe.","[""radar""]"
"Title: SPICES - Space-borne observations for detecting and forecasting sea ice cover extremes Abstract: The main objective of this proposal is to develop new methods to retrieve sea ice parameters from existing (and imminent) satellite sensors to provide enhanced products for polar operators and prediction systems, specifically addressing extreme and unexpected conditions. 
Automatic remote sensing products traditionally provide general information on sea ice conditions such as ice extent and concentration. However, for ice charting, tactical navigation and management of off-shore activities much more important is to know and avoid hazardous sea ice conditions. In general, sea ice hazards are related to sea ice thickness. More often than not polar ships and off-shore platforms are only operating during summer seasons and certain regions. This is because they are designed to resist typical forces of induced by pack ice, but they are not designed to resist the extreme sea ice conditions. 

Ongoing climate warming has manifested as shrinking and thinning of pack ice in the Arctic. This is a primary driver for the increasing shipping, oil and gas explorations and mining activities in the Arctic. However, severe sea ice conditions still exist and in consequence many locations are impossible for ship based operations. Moreover, year-to-year variability of sea ice is very large and hazardous multiyear ice (MYI) floes sometimes appear also in typically seasonally ice free regions.

In order to response needs of increase polar activities, we propose to focus on detection of sea ice extremes and automatic production of “sea ice warnings” products. In particular, we aim for a detection of MYI floes in a area composed mostly first-year ice from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), heavily ridged ice regions from SAR, the thickest ice from radar altimeter (RA) thickness profiles, regional anomalies of thick or thin ice via passive microwave (PMW) data, sea ice areas vulnerable for the wave action, detection of early/late melting season and improving capabilities to forecast seasonal sea ice extremes.","[""radar""]"
"Title: 5G ESSENCE - Embedded Network Services for 5G Experiences Abstract: 5G ESSENCE addresses the paradigms of Edge Cloud computing and Small Cell as a Service by fuelling the drivers and removing the barriers in  the Small Cell market, forecasted to grow at an impressive pace up to 2020 and beyond and to play a key-role in the 5G ecosystem. 5G ESSENCE provides a highly flexible and scalable platform,able to support new business models and revenue streams by creating a neutral host market and reducing operational costs by providing new opportunities for ownership, deployment,toperation and amortisation.
The technical approach exploits the benefits of the centralisation of Small Cell functions as scale grows through an edge cloud environment based on a two-tier architecture: a first distributed tier for providing low latency services and a second centralised tier for providing high processing power for computing-intensive network applications. This  allows decoupling the control and user planes of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and achieving the benefits of Cloud-RAN without the enormous fronthaul latency restrictions. The use of end-to-end network slicing mechanisms will allow sharing the 5G ESSENCE infrastructure among multiple operators/vertical industries and customising its capabilities on a per-tenant basis. The versatility of the architecture is enhanced by high-performance virtualisation techniques for data  isolation, latency reduction and resource efficiency, and by orchestrating lightweight virtual resources enabling efficient Virtualised Network Function placement and live migration. 5G ESSENCE leverages knowledge, SW modules and prototypes from various 5G-PPP Phase-1 projects,SESAME being particularly relevant. Building on these foundations, very ambitious objectives are targeted, culminating with the prototyping and demonstration of 5G ESSENCE system in three real-life use cases associated to vertical industries, i.e., edge network acceleration in a crowded event, mission critical applications, and in-flight communications.","[""5G""]"

"Title: 5G-CORAL - 5G-CORAL: A 5G Convergent Virtualised Radio Access Network Living at the Edge Abstract: The 5G-CORAL project leverages on the pervasiveness of edge and fog computing in the Radio Access Network (RAN) to create a unique opportunity for access convergence. This is envisioned by the means of an integrated and virtualised networking and computing solution where virtualised functions, context-aware services, and user and third-party applications are blended together to offer enhanced connectivity and better quality of experience. The proposed solution contemplates two major building blocks, namely (i) the Edge and Fog computing System (EFS) subsuming all the edge and fog computing substrate offered as a shared hosting environment for virtualised functions, services, and applications; and (ii) the Orchestration and Control System (OCS) responsible for managing and controlling the EFS, including its interworking with other (non-EFS) domains (e.g., transport and core networks, distant clouds, etc.). Through the 5G-CORAL solution, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be achieved, notably an ultra-low end-to-end latency in the order of milliseconds. Moreover, new business prospects arise with new stakeholders in the value chain, notably small players owning computing and networking assets in the local service area, such as in shopping malls, airports, trains and cars. These environments will be used to validate the system in three complementary end-to-end large-scale testbeds in Taiwan, supporting innovative applications such as augmented reality, car safety, and IoT gateway.","[""5G"", ""bluetooth""]"

"Title: MORPHEMIC - Modelling and Orchestrating heterogeneous Resources and Polymorphic applications for Holistic Execution and adaptation of Models In the Cloud Abstract: MORPHEMIC proposes a unique way of adapting and optimizing Cloud computing applications by introducing the novel concepts of polymorph architecture and proactive adaptation. The former is when a component can run in different technical forms, i.e. in a Virtual Machine (VM), in a container, as a big data job, or as serverless components, etc. The technical form of deployment is chosen during the optimization process to fulfil the user’s requirements and needs. The quality of the deployment is measured by a user defined and application specific utility. Depending on the application’s requirements and its current workload, its components could be deployed in various forms in different environments to maximize the utility of the application deployment and the satisfaction of the user. Proactive adaptation is not only based on the current execution context and conditions but aims to forecast future resource needs and possible deployment configurations. This ensures that adaptation can be done effectively and seamlessly for the users of the application. The MORPHEMIC deployment platform will therefore be very beneficial for heterogeneous deployment in distributed environments combining various Cloud levels including Cloud data centres, edge Clouds, 5G base stations, and fog devices. Advanced forecasting methods, including the ES-Hybrid method recently winning the M4 forecasting competition, will be used to achieve the most accurate predictions. The outcome of the project will be implemented in the form of the complete solution, starting from modelling, through profiling, optimization, runtime reconfiguration and monitoring. Then the MORPHEMIC implementation will be integrated as a pre-processor for the existing MELODIC platform extending its deployment and adaptation capabilities beyond the multi-cloud and cross-cloud to the edge, 5G, and fog. This approach allows for a path to early demonstrations and commercial exploitation of the project results.","[""5G""]"

The main driving factors of all the beneficiaries are reduced order modeling techniques for real-time, inverse and optimization problems. In fact, these issues are seen by industry as a major asset to increase performance and competitiveness. The ultimate goal is to produce the next generation of European research engineers, leaders in the use of these methodologies for industry related problems.
To achieve the ETN objectives, AdMoRe is based on training-through-research of ESRs with personalized frontier-research projects and active participation in network activities (viz. industrial placements, AdMoRe schools, conferences, dissemination, organization of events). Training will involve multi-disciplinary modeling (i.e. solids, fluids, structures, electromagnetics, acoustics), inter-disciplinary modeling (i.e. fluid-structure interaction, electro-magneto-mechanics, thermo-mechanics, aerodynamic noise) and new emerging scientific fields (i.e. geometrically enhanced finite elements/volumes, reduced order techniques, validation…), with a highlighted industrial edge bringing necessary transversal skills (i.e. through active involvement of the industrial partners). 
Furthermore, ESRs will be trained to develop core entrepreneurial skills to successfully move ideas into commercial practice through a series of transversal-entrepreneurship modules, as part of their training. The active involvement of industrial partners in AdMoRe ensures that both the research development and the ESR training will deliver research engineers that will be able to lead computer modeling in European industry and enterprise.","[""radar""]"
"Title: STUSOCSTA - Students, social change and the construction of the post-independence Algerian state, 1962-1978 Abstract: This project seeks to bring a new perspective to understanding state construction in Algeria after independence. Through a history of the first generations of Algerians who went to university in the 1960s and 1970s, it explores the intersections between political and institutional transformations and social, cultural and economic processes. These processes include increasing literacy, rural to urban migration, migration to study abroad and changes in gender relations and family structures. Bringing together concepts and methodologies from across a number of humanities and social science disciplines, the project will produce a case study setting out new approaches to studying state-building as a dynamic process which takes place at different levels of power (transnational, national and local) and which both shapes, and is shaped by, individual agency and wider processes. The goal is for this approach to be applicable to a range of other post-colonial contexts, challenging teleological readings of post-independence histories and homogenising understandings of post-independence states. 

The project is to be carried out in Algeria, France and the UK, with the researcher working with leading experts in the field in each of these countries to create a transnational, interdisciplinary network exploring the central research themes. Through extensive interviewing of former students, this project will create a new body of sources for researchers, which will also, with informants’ consent, be made accessible online. Public engagement is integral to the research design and process of data collection as well as dissemination, with Algerian students from the 1960s and 1970s invited to participate in group testimony sessions, alongside the wider public, throughout the project.","[""teleology""]"
"Title: 5G-MoNArch - 5G Mobile Network Architecture for diverse services, use cases, and applications in 5G and beyond Abstract: Motivation: The expected diversity of services and use cases in 5G requires a flexible, adaptable, and programmable architecture. While the design of such an architecture has been addressed by 5G-PPP Phase 1 at a conceptual level, it must be brought into practice in Phase 2. To this end, 5G-MoNArch will (i) evolve 5G-PPP Phase 1 concepts to a fully-fledged architecture, (ii) develop prototype implementations and (iii) apply these prototypes to representative use cases.

Approach: 5G-MoNArch architecture design will combine Phase 1 concepts (such as virtualisation, slicing and orchestration of access and core functions) with three enabling innovations that fill gaps not ad-dressed in Phase 1: (i) inter-slice control and cross-domain management, to enable the coordination across slices and domains, (ii) experiment-driven optimization, to leverage experimental results to design highly performing algorithms, and (iii) cloud-enabled protocol stack, to gain flexibility in the orchestration of virtualised functions.

Testbeds: The devised architecture will be deployed in two testbeds: (i) the sea port, representative of a vertical industry use case, and (ii) the touristic city, representative of a mobile operator deployment. For each testbed, 5G-MoNArch will instantiate the architecture and complement it with a use case specific functionality – the two functional innovations of 5G-MoNArch: (i) resilience and security, needed to meet the sea port requirements, and (ii) resource elasticity, to make an efficient use of the resources in the touristic city. 

Impact: 5G-MoNArch has a very high potential for commercial impact, including enhanced products (e.g., orchestrators or edge-cloud RAN), novel services (enabled by network slicing) and opportunities for new market players. To exploit this potential, 5G-MoNArch has elaborated a thorough and realistic innovation plan that includes patents and standards.","[""5G""]"

"Title: ROBORDER - autonomous swarm of heterogeneous RObots for BORDER surveillance Abstract: Border authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) across Europe face important challenges in how they patrol and protect the borders. Their work becomes more problematic considering the heterogeneity of threats, the wideness of the surveyed area, the adverse weather conditions and the wide range of terrains. Although there are several research tools and works targeting these areas independently for border surveillance, nowadays border authorities do not have access to an intelligent holistic solution providing all aforementioned functionalities.
Towards delivering such a solution, ROBORDER aims at developing and demonstrating a fully-functional autonomous border surveillance system with unmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles, capable of functioning both as standalone and in swarms, which will incorporate multimodal sensors as part of an interoperable network. The system will be equipped with adaptable sensing and robotic technologies that can operate in a wide range of operational and environmental settings. To provide a complete and detailed situational awareness picture that supports highly efficient operations, the network of sensors will include static networked sensors such as border surveillance radars, as well as mobile sensors customised and installed on board unmanned vehicles. 
To succeed implementing an operational solution, a number of supplementary technologies will also be applied that will enable the establishment of robust communication links between the command and control unit and the heterogeneous robots. On top of this, detection capabilities for early identification of criminal activities and hazardous incidents will be developed. This information will be forwarded to the command and control unit that will enable the integration of large volumes of heterogeneous sensor data and the provision of a quick overview of the situation at a glance to the operators, supporting them in their decisions.","[""radar""]"

"Title: VirtuWind - Virtual and programmable industrial network prototype deployed in operational Wind park Abstract: With anticipated exponential growth of connected devices, future networks require an open solutions architecture facilitated by standards and a strong ecosystem. Such devices need an easy interface to the connected network to request the kind of communication service characterized by guarantees about bandwidth, delay, jitter, packet loss or redundancy. In response, the network should grant the requested network resources automatically and program the intermediate networking devices based on device profile and privileges. Similar requirement also comes from business applications where application itself asks for particular network resources based on its needs. Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) provide promising combination leading to programmable connectivity, rapid service provisioning and service chaining.

"Title: CITYCoP - Citizen Interaction Technologies Yield Community Policing Abstract: Theories underlying community policing received new impetus with the recent advent of smartphones and social media and especially user-generated content (UGC) where citizens engage in closer interaction with their local community and law enforcement agency (LEA). The years 2010-2014 have seen a rapid upsurge of smartphone apps aimed at improving crime reporting and other forms of UGC and interaction associated with community policing. Yet these apps are characterised by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon approach with the largest number originating in the USA, a few in Canada, Australia and with the UK apparently the only major EU state where there has been some take-up of these technologies. CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining “local flavour” and diversity. These ICT solutions will also be designed from scratch to be fully compliant with strict privacy and data protection laws. A training scheme, including use of serious games, will be developed to assist training of officers and citizens in use of the app and portal.

"Title: SPOTLIGHT - Single Point Of aTtachment communications empowered by cLoud computing and bIG data analytics running on-top of massively distributed and loosely-coupled Heterogeneous mobile data neTworks Abstract: To handle the unprecedented demand for mobile data traffic, different vendors, operators and research programmes have aimed to develop radio access technologies (RATs) that boost physical-layer link capacity, utilize millimeter wave radio, or further densify network topology. Notable steps have also been made towards shifting baseband processing from the (currently) ultra dense network edge to a central location where coordinated resource management will be performed. Nonetheless, the today’s mobile network ecosystem includes vastly heterogeneous, evidently overlapping (in coverage) and fully isolated (in operation) attachment points that still handle most of the functions necessary for mobile data communications independently. Aiming to meet and surpass the requirements set for the 5G-and-Beyond mobile data network, in SPOTLIGHT we will create a fully-integrated and multi-disciplinary network of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) that will analyze, design, and optimize the performance of a disruptive new mobile network architecture: the SPOTLIGHT architecture. This architecture promises to break performance limitations present to the currently loosely inter-connected, resource-fragmented and isolated in operation mobile network ecosystem, by transforming the currently loosely-coupled multitude of heterogeneous and multi-layered RATs to a flat coalition of massively distributed antenna sub-systems that are optimally orchestrated by a cloud-empowered network core. Our primary aim will be to support for the first time self-including yet ultra-reliable radio communications at the edge network. To further reduce response time and enhance network resilience, all functions necessary for mobile communications will be subject of i) massive parallelization in cloud platforms at the network core and ii) big data analysis running on-top of a virtual pool of shared energy, radio, computing and storage resources at the network.","[""5G"", ""4G"", ""data networks""]"
"Title: COREGAL - Combined Positioning-Reflectometry Galileo Code Receiver for Forest Management Abstract: Biomass mapping has gained increased interest for bioenergy, climate research and mitigation activities, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (e.g. REDD initiative).

However, continuous deforestation activity and forest management requires frequent and accurate monitoring which can be expensive and difficult to attain. In Brazil, optical satellite data is typically used by government but even such does not allow accurate enough mapping due cloud coverage, requiring combination of other sources such as in-situ and air-borne measurements. Furthermore, satellite radar signals can penetrate clouds but still today the spatial resolution is not sufficient.

In COREGAL, a low cost unmanned fixed-plane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and service for biomass mapping will allow wide scale mapping in the Brazilian context of forest management. A first of a kind combined Position-Reflectometry Galileo receiver will be developed as main sensor for platform positioning and biomass estimation, the latter using reflected GNSS signals (also called GNSS-R) on tree canopies. High positioning accuracy (centimetre level) is required for surface point reflection determination, which is challenging for remote areas where no GNSS infrastructure is available as in the case of many forests in Brazil. However, Galileo AltBOC E5 signals offer unprecedented pseudorange measurement quality which can be used for novel high accuracy positioning.

The UAV will be equipped and tested with a COREGAL receiver and optical cameras for aerial mapping and biomass estimation, enabling wide scale low cost mapping: UAV mapping is at least one order of magnitude lower cost than manned air-borne missions while GNSS-R can be seen as bi-static radar replacing expensive, heavy and power consuming radars.

"Title: ImpactVision - A new standard for food safety and quality Abstract: ImpactVision is a machine learning company, applying advanced imaging technology to food supply chains in order to improve food quality, generate consistent products and reduce waste. Our software provides insights about the quality of foods and is aimed at food processors, manufacturers, distributors and retailers. For example, our system is able to determine the freshness of fish, the ripeness of avocados or the presence of foreign objects rapidly, non-invasively and at production grade speeds.

Hyperspectral imaging technology captures information our eyes cannot, in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our goal is to provide objective, real-time food quality data to the 30,000+ food processing facilities across the USA and improve efficiency of the global food supply chain. Currently, a third of all food produced is wasted. To illustrate the environmental impact at scale, managing food waste sustainably could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 500 million tonnes - the equivalent of taking all the cars off the road in the European Union. By digitizing food quality control, we improve yields and prevent waste, whilst increasing food companies’ revenues, which is particularly prescient considering the industry has razor thin profit margins.

ImpactVision combines a hyperspectral sensor installed above a conveyor belt with software that analyzes images and provides real time insights about quality.

By pursuing the present feasibility study, the management team aims to improve its understanding of international market conditions and the associated risks that need to be considered as the company develops a deeper business plan for rolling out, and scaling up ImpactVision as a marketable innovative solution. SME Instrument Phase-1 and Phase-2 will be extremely beneficial in helping the company to accelerate development and market penetration of the solution in target segments, boosting the company’s growth to 94 employees and $109M revenues by 2024.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: NOSY - New Operational Sensing sYstem Abstract: Organized crime investigation can greatly benefit from the availability of very small, concealable sensing devices to monitor, record and communicate criminal activity to remote surveillance stations. Acquired data can be used as proof in Courts of Justice only if the sensing device, the communication channel and the monitoring station are tamper proof and comply with all legal, integrity and chain-of-custody requirements. 
The NOSY project is focused on the development of a miniaturized yet highly sensitive platform, for the detection of illicit or suspicious substances. The platform includes the development of a miniature sensing device, a monitoring station and communication infrastructure for LEA network integration. The enabling technology of the system is an innovative microelectronics sensor that combines state of the art micro and nanotechnologies with advanced smart sensing materials, which will be integrated as part of the project. In addition there will be the development of complete devices for both stand alone and embeddable monitoring and recording. A critical requirement is that the recorded or transmitted data to be usable as proof in Court. The device will include proofing from any type of external tampering; the communication channel will be secure, compliant and integrated into the existing LEA data networks. As deemed necessary by LEAs, the project will develop prototype products to help tackle illegal drug trafficking and development of homemade bombs. Accurate and unambiguous identification of substances is fundamental to allow LEA to intervene with the most suitable action or counter measure. LEAs will be involved at all critical milestones of the project, from initial requirements, to a first prototype validation, to the extensive trial phase. The project will also propose a certification process tailored to the new sensing devices to enable their legal validation for forensics use while in compliance with European privacy requirements.","[""data networks"", ""mobile phones""]"
"Title: G MOTIT - Galileo-Enhanced MOTIT: an electric scooter sharing service for sustainable urban mobility Abstract: Causing peaks in pollution, wasted time and noise nuisance, traffic jams are one of the greatest challenges to overcome for the majority of large cities around the world. It’s a problem that affects the richest countries and developing countries alike, and the possible solutions are as slow to put in place as they are difficult to enforce. Moreover, the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. These facts highlight the need of efficient and environmentally sustainable urban mobility services that do not generate CO2 emissions and ease traffic congestion. 
Within this context, an innovative service has been developed in order to solve mobility problems in the city of Barcelona and potentially major metropolitan areas in Europe. MOTIT is a unique and innovative electric scooter sharing service, in which users may pick up and drop off vehicles wherever and whenever they want. MOTIT allows users to reserve a scooter with their smartphone, and some minutes before the start of the trip he receives a notification on his smartphone with the position of the vehicle assigned. 
Vehicle positioning performance is key for the success of the service, since the user is informed on where to pick up his vehicle based on this source. During initial pilot operations, supported by European Commission R&D funding , GPS-based solution (embedded on the tablet device of the vehicle) has proven not to be a reliable solution because of:
• Lack of availability in certain areas of the city (deep urban)
• Positioning errors, and therefore misleading scooter location information to user
Therefore, G-MOTIT project aims to overcome these problems by developing and integrating an EGNSS-based location technology. The location solution will be validated both functionally and operationally through a small-scale demonstration in Grand Paris region.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: 6G BRAINS - Bring Reinforcement-learning Into Radio Light Network for Massive Connections Abstract: Ubiquitous smart wireless connectivity is critical for future large-scale industrial tasks, services, assets and devices. Very significantly improved connectivity needs to be unlocked through novel spectrum combinations and the fully autonomous management of the underlying network resources by applying online AI at multiple decision layers. 6G BRAINS aims to bring AI-driven multi-agent Deep Reinforcement-Learning (DRL) to perform resource allocation over and beyond massive machine-type communications with new spectrum links including THz and optical wireless communications (OWC) to enhance the performance with regard to capacity, reliability and latency for future industrial networks. We propose a novel comprehensive cross-layer DRL driven resource allocation solution to support the massive connections over device-to-device (D2D) assisted highly dynamic cell-free network enabled by Sub-6 GHz/mmWave/THz/OWC and high resolution 3D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) of up to 1 mm accuracy. The enabling technologies in 6G BRAINS focus on four major aspects including disruptive new spectral links, highly dynamic D2D cell-free network modelling, intelligent end-to-end network architecture integrating the multi-agent DRL scheme and AI-enhanced high-resolution 3D SLAM data fusion. The proposed solution will be validated by proof-of-concept trials. The primary and secondary applications of THz and OWC technologies for a very broad spectrum of scenarios will be validated at BOSCH’s self-contained smart factory. The developed technologies will be widely applicable to various vertical sectors such as Industry 4.0, intelligent transportation, eHealth, etc. In particular, new business opportunities emerging in 6G BRAINS will be identified for follow-up exploitation activities. The results of 6G BRAINS are expected to create a solid basis for future projects and global standardisation for B5G and 6G technologies in areas relevant to industrial environments.","[""radio technology""]"
"Title: Playfields - Playfields: Prototyping a location based game for higher education. Abstract: The idea for this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to develop a prototype of a location-based game (LBG) that can be used for teaching fieldwork in a Higher Education (HE) setting. The rationale behind it is that location-based games, understood here as  pervasive games in which gameplay develops through a player's mobile location, are promising educational tools for fieldwork, as they:

-	Are close to student’s lifestyle as digital natives 
-	Offer innovative and creative technologies for using methods in vivo. 
-	Offers educators possibilities to monitor and supervise students’ progress 
-	Allow for different interactions between students, teachers and learning environments 
-	Allow for more creative learning processes for understanding environments and people 
-	Offer accessible and informal ways to break down barriers between researcher and “researched” 

The game we envisage to prototype will consist of an OpenStreetMap based GPS enabled mobile phone app that can be  used by students while conducting fieldwork. The game mixes spatial and qualitative approaches, that prompt students to complete certain educational tasks, plan routes , create narratives, or “claim” certain spots or areas. The app will then feed data created by the students (GPS check-ins, images, texts, recordings) back to a main computer where the findings and activities  are collected, scored with points and evaluated by the teachers of the course. Through this central interface organisers of the course as well as BOTs (automated tasks/non-playable entities in the game-world) can send messages, advise and tasks  to the participants, information that is also used to share and evaluate the results with students in the classroom. Likewise students can communicate with their supervisors while in the field through this central interface to ask for advise.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: iSCAPE - Improving the Smart Control of Air Pollution in Europe Abstract: The iSCAPE project aims to integrate and advance the control of air quality and carbon emissions in European cities in the context of climate change through the development of sustainable and passive air pollution remediation strategies, policy interventions and behavioural change initiatives. It will tackle the problem of reducing air pollution at target receptors with an innovative SME-led approach, focusing on the use of “Passive Control Systems” in urban spaces. Improvements in air quality, microclimate and behavioural aspects of urban dwellers will be achieved by applying real-world physical interventions on the urban tissue to alter ventilation rates and dispersion patterns in the selected cities assessed for future climate change scenarios and representative of different cultural&life styles in Europe. Through the approach of Living Labs the team will deploy a network of air quality and meteorological sensors (both stationary and mobile) and evaluate through analysis and a suite of up-to-date numerical modelling the benefits expected from the interventions on a neighbourhood and city-wide scale for several aspects ranging from quantification of pollutant concentration to exposure. iSCAPE encapsulates the concept of “smart cities” by promoting the use of low-cost sensors, engaging citizens in the use of alternative solution processes to environmental problems. iSCAPE will support sustainable urban development by promoting the sharing of results with policy-makers and planners using local test-cases, and providing scientific evidence ready-to-use solutions potentially leading to real-time operational interventions. This integrated approach will include the development and assessment of a framework aimed at changing the mobility behaviour of people by studying processes and dynamics that lead to more resilient, healthy, and sustainable cities, by bringing together theory from urban planning, public policy, urban and environmental sociology and urban geography.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: EXFILES - Extract Forensic Information for LEAs from Encrypted SmartPhones Abstract: ""Technological advances and development of sophisticated functions in mobile devices led to new usages and dependencies. Mobile phones are often a key factor in criminal cases, intrusions, intellectual property theft, security threats, and more. The data stored in these devices may contain critical evidence associated with the above-mentioned crimes. 
The latest generation of devices incorporate new security features and encryption schemes to """"protect"""" the device and its associated user data. The other side of the coin is that the rapid processing of critical evidence by various information retrieval techniques is slowed down, if not made impossible. The mobile device forensics field is a challenging area for forensic analysts, particularly given the increasing number of data encryption mechanisms.
The EXFILES project aims to provide law enforcement agencies (LEAs) with new tools to extract data and associated evidence from these devices in strict legal contexts. A unique consortium of five LEAs, universities and cyber security companies from the EU have joined forces to address these challenges. Together, they defined three areas of work on technical data extraction techniques, namely software exploitation, hardware methods and combined methods. In addition, tools and methods inspired by other areas of information security (e.g. security assessments based on common criteria) will lead to new judicial methods of accessing data for lawful investigations. Another unique dimension of EXFILES is the clear focus on the ethical and legal aspects of research and exploitation as well as dissemination and training activities for the next generation of forensic experts.
The main objective of EXFILES project is to improve Law Enforcement Agencies techniques and methods, to extract digital evidence from modern encrypted smartphones used by criminals based on holistic approach (both software and hardware).

"Title: ARTSFORMATION - Mobilising the Arts for an Inclusive Digital Transformation Abstract: Thirty years ago, the internet, social media and smartphones had not been invented. Yet a generation later, almost every facet of our individual, public and -now- online life are dominated by the fast-pacing digital transformation. Last year we saw the privacy and data of millions of social media users compromised with little to no accountability for those responsible, national elections influenced by users in different states, news outlets struggling to convince readers of facts, and the European Union taking proactive measure to protect the data privacy of its citizens in its first transnational regulatory action. Yet, the digital literacies and capabilities necessary for citizens to thrive in a digital society and act as responsible and effective participants, are unequally distributed across the European cultural, economic and social strata, with the public sphere consequently rapidly dissolving. ARTSFORMATION will respond through research, innovation and applied artistic practice to these societal challenges, by equitably developing the capacity of artists and citizens alike -including those from geographically remote, socio-economically excluded minority, refugee and migrant backgrounds- to respond cohesively in making their communities and groups resilient and adaptive in the 4th Industrial Revolution.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: EMPOWER - EMPOWERING a reduction in use of conventionally fueled vehicles using Positive Policy Measures. Abstract: The main objective of EMPOWER is to substantially reduce the use of conventionally fueled vehicles (CFV) in cities by influencing the mobility behaviour of CFV drivers and users towards fundamental change. To achieve this objective EMPOWER will create a set of tools for industry, policy makers and employers. These will empower them beyond the lifespan of this project to understand, help choose and successfully implement ‘positive’ evidence-based and cost-effective policy interventions, based on new and innovative mobility services, and in the context of already existing infrastructure, policy and measures. EMPOWER will reduce the use of CFV by: shifting trips to other modes/other vehicle types, promoting sharing and self-organisation and reducing demand overall e.g. through remote access to services. Undesirable impacts from CFV use will be reduced by: shifting CFV use to outside peak times and diversions to avoid particular areas/routes. The research will be multidisciplinary and involve: social science research with the public, 4 living lab experiments and 7 City demonstrators which will be chosen through an open 'bidding' process. The EMPOWER concept will be used in practice by: City stakeholders being able (through a software tool) to choose positive policy options based on their expected impacts and deliver incentives and social network sharing schemes to individuals using software. The innovation outputs of EMPOWER include an EMPOWER Toolkit to support industry, policy makers and employers to understand, choose and implement positive policy interventions. The Toolkit includes: new mobility services to provide innovative positive policy measures, new evidence on behavioural responses and impacts from positive incentives, improved organisational models for successful implementation of positive policy measures and innovation in the evaluation methodology for new mobility services. We expect at least 1 million persons to be impacted by EMPOWER.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: QUDOT-TECH - Quantum Dots for Photonic Quantum Information Technologies Abstract: Quantum physics has had a revolutionary impact on industry and society in the past century, giving birth to the semiconductor industry and the resulting first generation of quantum devices (computers, TVs, smartphones etc.). Whereas semiconductor physics has arisen from quantum science, the engineering principles of these first generation devices have remained anchored on classical physics. We are presently at the verge of a second revolution of quantum science, where quantum engineering based on direct exploitation of fundamental quantum mechanical abilities such as superposition and entanglement promises entire new technologies for society. However, lack of scalability of quantum information (QI) technology remains the fundamental technical challenge preventing most QI technologies from becoming a reality - a critical bottleneck to which a new generation of researchers is urgently needed. In QUDOT-TECH we build from the semiconductor QD - the most mature QI technology - and propose a solution to the scalability obstacle in the form of a quantum network based on QDs coupled efficiently to each other using optical waveguides. We will construct the world’s first platform for fully integrated on-chip QI processing, a cornerstone potentially equivalent to the silicon transistor in the first generation of quantum devices. As this is frontier research, current doctoral research programmes do not provide the required interdisciplinary skillset and the entrepreneurial-like mind-set required to secure application-oriented breakthroughs within the QI field. Hereto, we have gathered the best European academic and industrial partners to train 15 ESRs to an outstanding level, where they can act as Europe’s future leaders within QI technology. The QUDOT-TECH ESRs will fill in a much needed link between academia and industry and will make the new technology widely available through one or more spin-out companies - ultimately propelling Europe to leadership at the global scale.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: IntelliGen - Advanced control platform for next generation Free Piston Engines (FPEs) for clean and efficient power generation Abstract: Clean and efficient Free Piston Engines (FPEs) offer numerous advantages over traditional ICE architectures. Despite some high-profile attempts (Volvo, General Motors, Toyota), FPEs have not yet realised large scale commercial applications as it is very challenging to control the motion of the piston sufficiently. This is a substantial engineering challenge requiring multiple control operations to be performed repeatedly in a millisecond timescale to combat piston drift. There is a need for a flexible platform technology that enables FPEs to address the large range of potential use-cases, and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. IntelliGen is a ground-breaking platform technology for precise control of Free Piston Engines (FPEs), an emerging class of ICEs, which enables higher fuel efficiency, ultra-low emissions, and reduction in the operating cost of power. Furthermore, FPEs are compatible with low carbon and renewable fuels. Due to inherent problems with controlling the variable motion of the piston, commercial FPE development programmes had stalled, until now. IntelliGen enables precise control of piston motion and allows FPE architectures to be designed and scaled to suit any application including automotive and mobile power generation. The revolutionary platform unlocks the vast potential residing in FPEs, paving the way for the next 4 billion engines and a cleaner, more sustainable future. During the phase 1 feasibility study, Libertine will establish a sound go-to-market strategy and supply chain, and will outline further development plans. In the second phase of the innovation project, Libertine will optimise the platform, test and deploy a miniaturised FPE for automotive application, demonstrate medium volume production and obtain certification.","[""telecommunications""]"
"Title: ARIA-VALUSPA - Artificial Retrieval of Information Assistants - Virtual Agents with Linguistic Understanding, Social skills, and Personalised Aspects Abstract: The ARIA-VALUSPA project will create a ground-breaking new framework that will allow easy creation of Artificial Retrieval of Information Assistants (ARIAs) that are capable of holding multi-modal social interactions in challenging and unexpected situations. The system can generate search queries and return the information requested by interacting with humans through virtual characters. These virtual humans will be able to sustain an interaction with a user for some time, and react appropriately to the user's verbal and non-verbal behaviour when presenting the requested information and refining search results. Using audio and video signals as input, both verbal and non-verbal components of human communication are captured. Together with a rich and realistic emotive personality model, a sophisticated dialogue management system decides how to respond to a user's input, be it a spoken sentence, a head nod, or a smile. The ARIA uses special speech synthesisers to create emotionally coloured speech and a fully expressive 3D face to create the chosen response. Back-channelling, indicating that the ARIA understood what the user meant, or returning a smile are but a few of the many ways in which it can employ emotionally coloured social signals to improve communication.  
As part of the project, the consortium will develop two specific implementations of ARIAs for two different industrial applications. A ‘speaking book’ application will create an ARIA with a rich personality capturing the essence of a novel, whom users can ask novel-related questions. An ‘artificial travel agent’ web-based ARIA will be developed to help users find their perfect holiday – something that is difficult to do with existing web interfaces such as those created by booking.com or tripadvisor.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: mmChannel - millimeter Wave Channel Modelling Considering Environmental Factors Abstract: The Millimetre-wave (mmWave) frequency band offers wide available bandwidth for 5G and future wireless networks. However, due to the large propagation attenuation of the mmWave frequency, real-world environmental factors, including weather, foliage, humans, vehicles, have a significant impact on the channel path loss. In order to design and optimise 5G and future networks, a mmWave channel model considering the environmental factors is urgently required. In this project, we aim to equip a ray-tracing channel model with environmental factors in the mmWave band. The goal will be approached through 3 work packages (WPs). First, the ER will develop a parametric attenuation model by parameterising the environmental factors and integrate it with a ray-tracing simulation model. Second, the ER will acquire the channel data for each corresponding environment factor and extract parameters using machine-learning-based methods. Third, the developed channel model will be applied to evaluate and optimise mmWave wireless networks taking environmental factors into account. This project will be an extension of the ER’s previous work, which will develop him to be a mature researcher.","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"

"Title: LCODA - Electronic scanning MIMO Radar for railway level crossing obstruction detection  alerting Abstract: The overall project objective is to develop an innovative low cost, low maintenance, high performance, high reliability electronic scanning radar sensor system (ES24) for level crossing obstacle detection, capable of detecting objects ranging from large vehicles to bicycles & people, including people lying down. Key features are, only a single sensor is needed to identify the wide range of object sizes, the sensor has no rotating parts & operates in all weathers.ES24 will enable track operators to monitor whether the track is clear or an object has been detected, significantly improving safety for both train passengers & crossing users.
More than 2,000 significant accidents occur each year on EU member states’ railways. Accounted economic costs are as high as €1.7bn. In 2013, 25% of all significant railway accidents (8% involving pedestrians, 17% vehicles) occurred at level crossings (LC’s). LC safety a key focus area across EU & global rail networks. The European Rail Agency  report 573 significant LC accidents occurred in the EU in 2012, resulting in 373 deaths & 336 serious injuries. Each significant LC accident is estimated to cost €1.7m, i.e. €974m for 2012. LC accidents have damaging impact on the key rail transport strengths: safety, reliability & speed.
Current object detection (LCOD) systems are expensive, have limited capability in terms of the size of object detected, need combined laser & radar sensor solutions to meet operator needs & generally have rotating parts requiring on-going maintenance. There are currently about 120 000 LCs in the EU. Reducing system cost & improving the performance dramatically increases the addressable LCOD market.

"Title: REACH - Renewable Energy and Connectivity Hub Abstract: Being a world leader in e-learning, e-banking and remote healthcare, EU companies are yet struggle to access the potential market of 1.4 billion off-grid people in developing regions. Off-grid communities in these regions rely on mobile phones for communication and to access essential services such as money transfer, healthcare. Without viable renewable alternatives, off-grid power in developing regions is currently provided through highly unsustainable fossil fuelled methods, and internet connectivity is exceptionally limited. This creates a significant business opportunity for providing reliable, clean and affordable charging for mobile phones and internet access. BuffaloGrid has developed a unique solar power based Hub system and a patent-pending remote payment control mechanism by which mobile phones (or other devices) can be charged under the control of a central server to ensure accountability, transparency and market insights. By combining renewable power and internet connectivity, BuffaloGrid enables EU companies to deliver essential internet-based services (e.g., e-health, e-education, e-governance etc) in developing regions. BuffaloGrid supplies Hubs free to local agents, offering them opportunities to provide mobile charging and internet access to their local communities. This will stimulate local enterprise, encourage entrepreneurship and boost economic development. BuffaloGrid’s unique model of providing the Hub for free, and unlocking access to power, allows demand to be met without charging high fees. Powered by solar energy, BuffaloGrid Hubs are emission-free during use and BuffaloGrid will take back Hubs for upgrade/ remanufacture/recycling at EoL (End-of-Life). During this project BuffaloGrid will develop a detail design of cost-optimised, mass-producible BuffaloGrid Hub with EU supply chain.

"Title: 5G-CARMEN - 5G for Connected and Automated Road Mobility in the European UnioN Abstract: European mobility is drastically changing: growing urbanisation, environmental aspects, and safety are only a few of the key indicators pointing in this direction. Road infrastructures and vehicles are blending with the digital world, becoming always-connected, automated and intelligent, delivering optimal experience to passengers, and addressing societal goals (e.g., emission and accident reduction) and economic needs (e.g., vehicles as smart-living environments). In this respect, the European Union pushes for large-scale collaborative cross-border validation activities on cooperative, connected and automated mobility. 
5G-CARMEN addresses these challenges harnessing the concept of “Mobility Corridors”. In 5G-CARMEN important European industries, academics and innovative SMEs commit to achieve world-wide impact by conducting extensive trials across an important corridor (by people/goods traffic volumes), from Bologna to Munich, spanning 600 km of roads, connecting three European regions (Bavaria, Tirol and Trentino/South-Tyrol) across three countries. Vehicle manoeuvre negotiation (at various levels of automation), infotainment, and emission control in sensitive areas are the cross-border use cases targeted by 5G-CARMEN pilots in order to maximise the project commercial, societal, end environmental impact.
The project will build a 5G-enabled corridor to conduct cross-border trials and will deploy a mixture of 5G micro- and macro-cells for ubiquitous C-V2X connectivity. The 5G New Radio will be used to support latency sensitive and/or bandwidth hungry services and applications.

"Title: WIPE - Wafer scale Integration of Photonics and Electronics Abstract: The WIPE project aims at developing hybrid electronic-photonic chips as a key enabling technology for data transmission purposes. It aims at bringing photonics to a new level by developing a concept that can be well industrialised. This sustains EU leadership in photonics, as is the ambition of the work program.   

A new wafer-scale technology will thus be developed for direct and intimate attachment of III-V Indium-Phosphide (InP) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and BiCMOS electronic chips (ICs). The ICs contain the driver, receiver andcontrol electronics for the PIC and enable direct connection to polymer optical waveguides. This technology of ‘wafer scale heterogeneous integration’ enables high-performance and high-density photonic-electronic (photronic) modules are created having a lower energy consumption, lower packaging complexity and lower cost compared to modules using more traditional interconnection techniques like wire bonding and laser welding of fibre connections. 

Next to the new bonding technology, an integrated module design technology is developed for efficient co-design of hybrid photonic and electronic modules. A library consisting of photonic/electronic standard modules, is created leveraging the process design kits (PDKs) of the most important European foundries of photonic chips in combination with a powerful BiCMOS. These tools are of significantimportance to industry, since they offer photronic module designers a standardised approach that highly facilitates the module design for SMEs and affordable manufacturing by photonic and electronic foundries. The WIPE approach will be proven by showing the feasibility of a 400Gb/s transceiver for data centre application.","[""data networks""]"

"Title: TADFORCE - Strengthening and survey beyond the knowledge of the TADF emitters as materials  for superefficient OLED devices Abstract: The OLED worldwide market is growing rapidly and Europe needs experts possessing a comprehensive knowledge and practical experience in this technology. OLED technology is used in small devices such as smart phones and tablets but also in high-end TVs and lighting, as OLEDs are still relatively expensive compared to LCD. But with research progressing towards lower cost and longer lifetime, together with a growing trend to use flexible displays in smartphones etc., the OLED market is growing fast. Europe is a huge supplier of the materials for OLED displays, taking in to account that electronic market is changing very fast and companies are search for new cheaper materials the input of research in this area is needed. The flexible OLED display market is predicted to quadruple next year, with predicted global market revenue for flexible OLEDs to increase from $21.9 million in 2013 to $12 billion by 2020 and this project will help to maintain Europe place as a major supplier of OLED materials.
The high demand for flexible OLEDs will increase the need for very expensive and rare iridium. The TADFORCE project aims to explore exciplex emitters and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in OLEDs i) to replace currently used Ir complexes, and ii) to show how to easily tune emitter, resulting in reduced production cost, especially blue, where Ir based emitters fails.

"Title: NeMESIS - Neuron-based Monitoring Electrochemical Bio-Sensor Interface System Abstract: Reliable, real-time detection systems for in-vivo, continuous monitoring of biological and chemical processes consist a crucial aspect in personalised healthcare. Nevertheless, even nowadays, the medical practice still lacks of systems providing a rapid, reliable and ultra-sensitive sensing in a continuous way. Meanwhile, inflammatory markers consist a pivotal tool in clinical practice since they may be indicators of specific diseases, along with signalising the response of a patient to a specific medical treatment. Nanotechnology-based devices exhibiting memristive electrical properties show great potential for delivering highly scalable, resilient, power efficient and reconfigurable electronic systems. In addition, when those particular nanodevices are subjected to appropriate surface treatments and implemented in the role of bio-inspired sensors, they can bring solutions and introduce novelty to the bio-sensing field regarding highly sensitive and robust detection of biomarkers, while expanding and broadening the research field and applications involving memristive phenomena. In the framework of this fellowship, a flexible, low-cost miniaturised minimally invasive sensing platform will be developed, implementing memristive nanoscale devices as intelligent bio-interfaces, allowing reliable, continuous and real-time monitoring of inflammatory markers. This scheme will be accomplished by the fabrication of a memristor-based sensing platform conjugated with a sensing membrane and an accordingly designed binding assay. Validation of the sensing platform for continuous monitoring will be followed by the integration on flexible substrates for in vivo measurements and integration with readout circuitry enabling the sensing data readout and the wireless transmission to a tablet or smartphone. Finally, the sensing platform will be applied for in-vivo, real-time monitoring, for the detection of inflammatory markers and for indicating the response to an applied treatment.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: SUPERFLUIDITY - Superfluidity: a super-fluid, cloud-native, converged edge system Abstract: Superfluidity is “a state in which matter behaves like a fluid with zero viscosity”. Our project aims at achieving superfluidity in the network: the ability to instantiate services on-the-fly, run them anywhere in the network (core, aggregation, edge) and shift them transparently to different locations.
The SUPERFLUIDITY project tackles crucial shortcomings in today’s networks: long provisioning times, with wasteful over-provisioning used to meet variable demand; reliance on rigid and cost-ineffective hardware devices; daunting complexity emerging from three forms of heterogeneity: heterogeneous traffic and sources; heterogeneous services and needs; and heterogeneous access technologies, with multi-vendor network components.
The SUPERFLUIDITY solution is based on: a decomposition of network components and services into elementary and reusable primitives; a native, converged cloud-based architecture; the virtualization of radio and network processing tasks; platform-independent abstractions, permitting reuse of network functions across heterogeneous hardware platforms, while catering to the vendors’ need for closed platforms/implementations; and high performance software optimizations along with leveraging of hardware accelerators.
As a result, the 5G network will benefit from: i) location-independence: network services deployable in heterogeneous networks; ii) time-independence: near instantaneous deployment and migration of services; iii) scale-independence: transparent service scalability; and iv) hardware-independence: development and deployment of services with high performance irrespective of the underlying hardware.
Through these properties, SUPERFLUIDITY will provide a converged cloud-based 5G concept that will enable innovative use cases in the mobile edge, empower new business models, and reduce investment and operational costs.

"Title: SPRING - Setting the framework for the enhanced impact of SPIRE projects Abstract: Increasing industrial uptake of project findings is at the heart of project SPRING. It is the essential building block for ensuring greater impact of SPIRE projects and therefore progress towards the SPIRE roadmap goals of increased resource and energy efficiency in the EU process industries.

Instead of focusing on a small cluster of projects, SPRING has been developed to provide the mechanism to enhance the impact of all SPIRE projects. 

Project SPRING’s objective is to increase progress towards the SPIRE goals and enhance return on investment in projects by addressing the needs of those who make the decisions to adopt process innovations in industry and barriers to their adoption. It will do this by providing guidance to project participants, decision makers in industry and broader SPIRE stakeholders, enabling them collectively to: 
1. Improve the articulation of the value of project exploitable outputs 
2. Improve the articulation of industry needs and barriers-to-uptake of exploitable outputs 
3. Improve the mapping of project value to industry needs 
4. Identify policy gaps and recommendations to improve project impact

"Title: QUSON - Quantum Sensing with Quantum Optical Networks Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits effects such as entanglement to enhance the sensitivity of measurement devices. In the last decade we have witnessed a significant advance in experimental platforms such as trapped ion setups and superconducting circuits. These systems are never free from noise and dissipation, however, interactions between qubits and photons or phonons can be controlled with lasers or external fields. Even in strong dissipative regimes, cooperative effects may induce complex quantum dynamics with emergent phenomena such as non-equilibrium phase transitions and multistability. The question then arises whether we can exploit those many-body effects in robust metrological protocols. 
My project will address this question in two main scenarios corresponding to different limits of a network of qubits coupled to photonic cavities. Firstly, I will consider a limit of weak coupling, in which cooperative radiative decay leads to the generation of entanglement. Secondly, I will investigate networks of qubits strongly coupled to photonic cavities. I will identify, and systematically investigate, points close to non-equilibrium phase transitions in which the abrupt response of the system can be used to accurately measure properties of driving fields. The project requires a rigorous theoretical description of the qubit-cavity network. Approximations such as a mean-field theory can be used for a preliminary study. However, to achieve my goals I will need to properly describe quantum correlations across the system. I will address this challenge by using Matrix Product States methods - an advanced quasi-exact numerical technique. 
My reference systems will be trapped ion setups and superconducting qubits coupled to microwave resonators. In my project, I will systematically investigate their performance as quantum sensors under realistic conditions. My work will lead to proposals for the accurate measurement of microwave fields, magnetic fields and ultra-weak forces.","[""optical networks""]"
"Title: 5G-PICTURE - 5G Programmable Infrastructure Converging disaggregated neTwork and compUte REsources Abstract: The explosive growth of mobile internet traffic introduces the need to transform traditional closed, static and inelastic network infrastructures into open, scalable and elastic ecosystems supporting new types of connectivity, high mobility and new mission-critical services for operators, vendors and vertical industries.
5G-PICTURE will develop and demonstrate a converged fronthaul and backhaul infrastructure integrating advanced wireless and novel optical network solutions. Τo address the limitations of the current D-RAN and C-RAN approaches, 5G-PICTURE will exploit flexible functional splits that can be dynamically selected, to optimise resource and energy efficiency.
This results in a paradigm shift, from RAN and C-RAN to ʽDis-Aggregated RANʼ (DA-RAN). DA-RAN is a novel concept where HW and SW components are disaggregated across the wireless, optical and compute/storage domains. ʽResource disaggregationʼ allows decoupling these components, creating a common “pool of resources” that can be independently selected and allocated on demand to compose any infrastructure service. Key enablers for DA-RAN are 1) network ʽsoftwarizationʼ, migrating from the conventional closed networking model to an open reference platform, supported through 2) HW programmability, where HW is configured directly by network functions, to provide the required performance. This will enable provisioning of any service by flexibly mixing-and-matching network, compute and storage resources without sacrificing performance and efficiency as is the case in today’s NFV-based solutions.
To validate these capabilities, 5G-PICTURE will demonstrate converged fronthaul and backhaul services in: a) a smart city environment, b) a 5G railway experimental testbed showcasing seamless service provisioning and mobility management in high-speed moving environments and c) a stadium with ultra-high user density, supporting media services.

"Title: MorpheuS - Hybrid Machine Learning – Optimization techniques To Generate Structured Music Through Morphing And Fusion Abstract: State-of-the-art music generation systems (Continuator, OMax, Mimi) produce music that sounds good on a note-to-note level but lacks critical structure/direction necessary for long term coherence. To tackle this problem, we propose to generate compositions based on structural templates at varying hierarchical levels. Our novel approach deploys machine-learning methods in an optimization context to morph existing pieces into new ones and to fuse different styles.

We aim to develop a framework that combines machine learning techniques that learn style, with a powerful optimization method, the variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm, for generating music. This approach allows the learned model to incorporate a wide variety of constraints, including those for preserving long term coherence and structure. It promises to effect a step-change in automatic music generation by moving the field in the new direction of generating structured music using hybrid machine learning-optimization techniques.

The applicant is an operations researcher-musician, ideal for this work. A first step combines her VNS music generation algorithm with machine learning methods to ensure proper style evaluation. In previous work, the applicant has shown that VNS outperforms genetic algorithms when generating counterpoint with a rule-based objective function. In a preliminary study, the applicant has demonstrated the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques as evaluation metrics for optimisation methods. The applicant has extensive web development experience; to reach the widest possible audience, the resulting system will be made available in an interactive website where users can morph and fuse musical pieces.
This work is situated in the area of digital media, with a European consumer expenditure of over €33 billion in 2011, projected to increase. Music generation in digital music has direct applications in game music, interactive arts, and stock-music for advertising/videos.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: LPGPU2 - Low-Power Parallel Computing on GPUs 2 Abstract: Low-power GPUs have become ubiquitous, they can be found in domains ranging from wearable and mobile computing, to automotive systems. With this ubiquity has come a wider range of applications exploiting low-power GPUs, placing ever increasing demands on the expected performance and power efficiency of the devices.  Future low-power system-on-chips will have to provide higher performance and be able to support more complex applications, without using any additional power.

The strict power limitations means that these demands cannot be met through hardware improvements alone, however, but the software must better exploit the available resources.  Unfortunately, programmers are hindered when creating low-power GPU software by the quality of current performance analysis tools.  In low-power GPU contexts there is only a minimal amount of performance information, and essentially no power information, available to the programmer.  As software becomes more complex it becomes increasingly unmanageable for programmers to optimise the software for low-power devices.

This project proposes to aid the programmer in creating software for low-power GPUs by building on the results of the first LPGPU project to provide a complete performance analysis process for the programmer.  This project will address all aspects of performance analysis, from hardware power and performance counters, to a toolchain that processes and visualises information from these counters, to applications that will be used as use-cases to drive the entire design.  To access the new hardware performance counters a standardisable API will be produced to interface to a prototype hardware implementation.  This will let the analysis and visualisation tool connect to any GPU driver that implements the API.  The consortium's expertise will be used not only to drive the initial design of the API and analyses, but also multiple application use-cases will be developed to demonstrate the efficacy of the toolchain.","[""mobile phones""]"
"Title: ECoWeB - Assessing and Enhancing Emotional Competence for Well-Being (ECoWeB) in the Young: A principled, evidence-based, mobile-health approach to prevent mental disorders and promote mental well-being Abstract: Although there are effective mental well-being promotion and mental disorder prevention interventions for young people, there is a need for more robust evidence on resilience factors, for more effective interventions, and for approaches that can be scalable and accessible at a population level. To tackle these challenges and move beyond the state-of-the-art, ECoWeB uniquely integrates three multidisciplinary approaches: 
(a) For the first time to our knowledge, we will systematically use an established theoretical model of normal emotional functioning (Emotional Competence Process) to guide the identification and targeting of mechanisms robustly implicated in well-being and psychopathology in young people; 
(b) A personalized medicine approach: systematic assessment of personal Emotional Competence (EC) profiles is used to select targeted interventions to promote well-being: 
(c) Mobile application delivery to target scalability, accessibility and acceptability in young people. 
Our aim is to improve mental health promotion by developing, evaluating, and disseminating a comprehensive mobile app to assess deficits in three major components of EC (production, regulation, knowledge) and to selectively augment pertinent EC abilities in adolescents and young adults. It is hypothesized that the targeted interventions, based on state-of-the-art assessment, will efficiently increase resilience toward adversity, promote mental well-being, and act as primary prevention for mental disorders. The EC intervention will be tested in cohort multiple randomized trials with young people from many European countries against a usual care control and an established, non-personalized socio-emotional learning digital intervention. Building directly from a fundamental understanding of emotion in combination with a personalized approach and leading edge digital technology is a novel and innovative approach, with potential to deliver a breakthrough in effective prevention of mental disorder.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: Smartphone-ANCIH - Smartphone A new concept in hearing…”: an interactive real-time embedded audio solution that offers a significant/disruptive change in hearing technology and market. Abstract: Effective hearing ability influences individuals’ overall quality of life, particularly in situations (such as in work-places, meetings, classrooms, social gatherings, or using audio devices) where unwanted noise constantly tests and challenges our audio processing capabilities. In these situations all existing hearing aids share a common underlying concept flaw due to the fixed position of the microphone and the lack of user interactivity. Coupled with inelegant and unfashionable designs, this causes many hearing-impaired individuals to opt out of using hearing aids and withdraw from these social/work group situations.
The Smartphone platform is an excellent example of technology with the potential to enhance the audio experience of individuals with hearing loss whilst blurring the distinction between hearing and consumer technologies. Combined with our innovative audio separation techniques and pioneering wireless technology, it removes the social stigma and provides a significant step change in hearing market accessibility, dispensing and affordability allowing everyone to live fuller normal lives. Auriplex’s Smartphone “A new concept in hearing…” is innovative not only in technology but also in the market reach strategy: the solution would be aimed at a new market that is distinctly different from current hearing aid offerings but at the same time will be familiar as a consumer product and a logical next step with most technology users not only in the hard-of-hearing but also in the hearing world.

Current networks will be unable to face the future demands and their increasingly diverse set of services, users, applications and requirements what is forcing network operators to transform them. At the centre of this network transformation is the broad-scale deployment of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). 
5GTANGO puts forth the flexible programmability of 5G networks with i) a NFV-enabled Service Development Kit (SDK), ii) a Store with advanced validation and verification mechanisms for VNFs/Network Services qualification (including 3rd party contributions) and iii) a modular Service Platform in order to bridge the gap between business needs and network operational management systems.  We propose an integrated vendor-independent platform where the outcome of the development kit, that is a packaged NFV forwarding graph, is automatically tested and validated in the Store for their posterior deployment with a customizable orchestrator compatible with common existing Virtual Infrastructure Managers (VIM) and SDN controllers in the market. This end-to-end ecosystem for the agile development and deployment of services realises an extended NFV DevOps model between service developers, telecom operators and vertical industries, increasing operational efficiency, facilitating the implementation and validation of new services and accelerating the adoption of NFV technologies.

"Title: ROAM - Revolutionising optical fibre transmission and networking using the Orbital Angular Momentum of light Abstract: The overall objective of the ROAM project is to investigate and demonstrate the use of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes of light for communications and networking. Two are the primary objectives.
The firs objective is to exploit the use of OAM modes in optical fibres as a disruptive means of increasing optical fibre transmission capacity for short-reach high data density applications. A transmission testbed utilising OAM multiplexing and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) dimensions will be demonstrated. The target will be a 10x or more capacity increase by employing 10 or more OAM multiplexed channels over a conventional WDM system. The combination of 10x OAM states with 16 wavelength channels will provide a total of 160 multiplexed channels. Full compatibility with legacy technologies will be demonstrated. Speciality fibres will be employed to support OAM modes transmission in the range up to 2 km.
The second objective is to exploit the use of OAM domain as a switching resource in conjunctions with the wavelength domain to significantly improve the scalability and the power consumption of the switches in data-centres applications. A 10x improvement of the scalability of the data-centre switches will be targeted with the study and development of an OAM-based switch compatible with the WDM layer. A switch exploiting 10 OAM modes and 16 wavelengths as switching domains will be implemented.

"Title: ACTiCLOUD - ACTivating resource efficiency and large databases in the CLOUD Abstract: Despite their proliferation as a dominant computing paradigm, cloud computing systems lack effective mechanisms to manage their vast amounts of resources efficiently, leading to severe resource waste and ultimately limiting their applicability to large classes of critical applications that pose non-moderate resource demands. This creates a significant need to lift existing technological barriers of actual fluidity and scalability of cloud resources towards promoting cloud computing as a critical cornerstone for digital economy.

ACTiCLOUD proposes a novel cloud computing architecture for drastically improved management of cloud resources, targeting 1.5x increase in resource efficiency and more than 10x in scalability. By utilizing modest investments on hardware intelligence that enables true resource disaggregation between multiple servers, we will progress current state-of-the-art in hypervisors and cloud management systems promoting holistic resource management at the rack scale and across distributed cloud sites. On top of this, we will evolve the ecosystem around in-memory databases, a core component for extremely demanding and highly critical classes of applications that up to now have faced severe difficulties in matching their resource requirements with state-of-the-art cloud offerings, with a final goal to provide cost-efficient and highly performant DataBase-as-a-Service (DBaaS) cloud platforms.

ACTiCLOUD builds on top of cutting-edge European technologies for cloud servers brought into the project by Numascale and Kaleao, and extends OnApp's MicroVisor, an innovative hypervisor to virtualize resources at the rack-scale. Furthermore it joins the forces of highly acclaimed academic institutions to address key research challenges and extend the capabilities of OpenStack and JVM.

"Title: 5G-CLARITY - Beyond 5G multi-tenant private networks integrating Cellular, WiFi, and LiFi, Powered by ARtificial Intelligence and Intent Based PolicY Abstract: The first generation of 5G networks launching commercially in 2019 will focus on the eMBB service for the retail sector. Thus, public 5G networks will not be able to address, in the short term, the promise of novel critical communication services required by vertical users. Private 5G and beyond 5G networks are seen as a promising way to bridge this gap, allowing private venues to deploy the required 5G capabilities early on. Factories and private venues, like stadiums or transportation hubs, are seen as key early adopters of these technologies.
5G-CLARITY puts forward a beyond 5G architecture for private networks, which features a novel access network integrating 5G, WiFi, and LiFi, compute and transport resources, and novel management components to enable AI driven network automation. Based on this architecture, 5G-CLARITY will define communication services that deliver measurable enhancements with respect to the eMBB and URLLC services defined by 3GPP in Release 16, in terms of low latency, area capacity, reliability, and accurate positioning and synchronization capabilities. In addition, 5G-CLARITY will develop a management plane featuring SDN/NFV components together with an AI engine that will automate network management by receiving high level intent policies from the network administrator.
5G-CLARITY brings together an ambitious consortium that ensures the delivery of the project innovations to standard bodies, where 3GPP, O-RAN, IEEE802.11bb, and ETSI-ZSM, have already been identified as preferential targets.

"Title: LocationWise - LocationWise Payment Card Validation: A cloud based location verification system that will significantly lower cost of payment card cyber security Abstract: The vision of LocationWise project is to lower fraud costs incurred by banks from €1.03 to €0.55 per transaction and thus saving Europe ca. €456 million annually. Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. €1.44 billion annually and €14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to €13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user’s mobile device to determine his/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%. Among other things, the purpose of Feasibility Study is to better understand the target market, determine optimum platform resources required to handle a given volume of transactions and to further refine IP strategy.","[""mobile network"", ""mobile phones""]"

"Title: PeTSoC - Lightweight and Flexible All-Perovskite Triple-junction Solar Cells Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources of the 21st century. For solar cells, the most important aspects for commercialization are power conversion efficiency and cost which can be combined into a €/W metric. Today, over 90% of the global solar industry is comprised of single-junction crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, however, c-Si solar cells have some limitations. The first is their non-mechanically flexible nature and second, their single-junction limit of efficiency which can be surpassed by multijunction technology. Lead-halide perovskites are generating substantial scientific and industrial interest because they are low-cost, highly efficient and bandgap tunable, key criteria for multijunction solar cells. Furthermore, perovskites can be deposited via thermal co-evaporation meaning that the devices in this project, can be made from start-to-finish entirely from industrially attractive vacuum deposition techniques. Unlike conventional c-Si, perovskites are a thin-film technology, which means they can be made into lightweight and flexible solar cells with a high power-to-weight ratio. Thus, they have additional applications for (1) portable electronic devices including smartphones and displays, (2) vehicles, drones and aircraft, (3) wearable textiles, and more. The project draws from two distinct areas of photovoltaics research, specifically lightweight and flexibility with high-efficiency achieved by multijunction technology, allowing it to compete competitively with crystalline silicon in conventional solar energy generation and niche applications. The experienced researcher will be joining StranksLab to build a strong fundamental photophysical understanding of thermally co-evaporated perovskite layers via state-of-the-art spectroscopy tools to target the development of a lightweight and flexible all-perovskite triple-junction solar cell with an efficiency >30%.","[""mobile phones""]"

This leads to complexity, weight penalty and increased exposure to intended (cybersecurity) and unintended (ElectroMagnetic Compatibility) interference. Overcoming these barriers requires an interdisciplinary cooperation and, in this context, the ADENEAS project emerged, aiming at paving the way for a safe, light, self-configuring, autonomous and modular power and data distribution network that is scalable to all aircraft sizes. To achieve this long-term objective, ADENEAS will define new architecture concepts, develop advanced Artificial Intelligence-based design tools, enabling technologies for intra-aircraft data communication and for power network and a cooling system. The project will also demonstrate the integration of the data and power network and cooling system, initiate standardisation activities and ensure commercial viability.
To achieve these objectives, ADENEAS will start from solid foundation of partner’s background, previous and ongoing R&D activities and will implement a stepwise approach from the definition of requirements and reference case (for small, medium and large aircraft) up to the assessment and evaluation of the developed, tested and demonstrated technologies. This includes strong involvement of an Industrial Advisory Board as well as standardisation perspective.
The ADENEAS future proof power and data network, scalable to all aircraft size, will support the Flightpath 2050 objective by allowing to save 0.7% block fuel burn and >156,000 kg of CO2 emitted per aircraft per year and secondary by optimizing maintenance and providing novel technologies to be deployed for increased passenger experience.","[""data networks""]"
"Title: AMBER - AMBER - enhAnced Mobile BiomEtRics Abstract: Over recent years the ubiquity of mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets devices has rapidly increased. These devices provide a range of untethered interaction unimaginable a decade previously. With this ability to interact with services and individuals comes the need to accurately authenticate the identity of the person requesting the transaction many of which carry financial/legally-binding instruction. Biometric solutions have also seen increased prominence over the past decade with large-scale implementations in areas such as passport and national ID systems. The adoption of specific biometric sensors by mobile vendors indicates a long-term strategy as a means of authentication. This adoption is is at critical point – users need to be confident of biometrics in terms of usability, privacy and performance; compromise in any one of these categories will lead to mistrust and a reluctance to adopt over and above conventional forms of authentication. The design, implementation and assessment of biometrics on mobile devices therefore requires a range of solutions to aid initial and continued adoption. The EU needs to have experts trained specifically in the field to ensure that it participates, competes and succeeds in the global market. 

AMBER comprises 11 partners with recognised expertise from across the EU. The specific objectives are to:

• Address a range of current issues facing biometric solutions on mobile devices requiring timely research and development.
• Collate Europe-wide complementary expertise to investigate these issues and provide a structure and environment to effectively facilitate training.
• Train and equip the next generation of researchers to define, investigate and implement solutions, and provide transferable skills to enable effective planning, management and communication of research ideas and outcomes.
• Develop solutions and theory to ensure secure, ubiquitous and efficient authentication whilst protecting privacy of citizen.","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: ProTego - Data-protection toolkit reducing risks in hospitals and care centers Abstract: Health care is an essential service that uses a great deal of sensitive personal data which has a high black market value being a lucrative target for data theft and ransomware attacks.The EU NIS Directive (EU 2016/1148) and GDPR (EU 2016/679) will harmonize and improve information security in Europe. Both require relevant ICT infrastructure operators to perform risk assessments, introduce appropriate security measures to manage identified risks, and report security breaches. Unfortunately, risk-based approaches are notoriously difficult to implement in a consistent and comprehensive fashion. They depend on a high level of understanding of both cybersecurity and of the system or network to be protected, are labour intensive and costly and typically done by small teams. This is increasingly inappropriate as health care providers introduce IoT systems, cloud services and (in the near future) 5G networks to provide services in which patients are more engaged, may own some of the devices used, and want access in hospitals, on the move or at home. The ProTego project will develop a toolkit and guidelines to help health care systems users address cybersecurity risks in this new environment by introducing 3 main advances over current approaches: Extensive use of machine intelligence: a combination of machine inference exploiting a priory knowledge for security-by-design, and machine learning from data for run-time threat detection and diagnosis; Advanced data protection measures: advanced encryption techniques and hardware based full memory encryption, and multi-stakeholder IAM to control access to and by user devices, to protect data at rest and provide ultra-secure data exchange portals; Innovative protocols for stakeholder education: using security-by-design analysis to target training and support stakeholders to contribute to networok overall security.The toolkit will be integrated and validated in IoT and BYOD-based case studies at two hospitals.","[""5G""]"
"Title: TalkingHeads - TalkingHeads: Audiovisual Speech Recognition in-the-wild Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition refers to the problem of recognizing speech using both audio and video information. Speech is not a purely auditory process but the way that the listener perceives it is also through the recognition of the visual patterns associated with the mouth movement. This correlation of the audio-visual information has been occasionally explored in literature in order to develop more robust automatic speech recognition systems for cases in which the auditory environment is noisy (e.g. background noise, multiple speakers). However, the problem of audio-visual speech recognition has been mainly studied in controlled, laboratory conditions. TalkingHeads proposes, for the first time, the problem of audio-visual speech recognition in unconstrained (in-the-wild) videos collected from real-world multimedia databases and a set of methodologies that will work well under the assumed in-the-wild setting. 

TalkingHeads brings together a talented but experienced researcher (ER) with expertise in speech analysis (diarization and recognition) and the Supervisor with large research experience in Computer Vision for face analysis in-the-wild (recognition, detection, alignment and tracking, and facial expression analysis). TalkingHeads will establish the ER as an independent and internationally recognized researcher in the area of audio-visual fusion and speech recognition. Through TalkingHeads’ achievable work plan, the ER will attain a high level of research maturity by (a) complementing his expertise on speech analysis through extensive training in Computer Vision, (b) conducting research on a challenging research problem (audio-visual speech recognition in-the-wild) with significant career opportunities in both the academia and the industry, (c) publishing at high impact factor  conferences and journals, (d) establishing a network of research collaborators, and (e) enhancing personal skills (e.g. supervisory experience, leadership and management skills).","[""mobile phones""]"

"Title: VESAFE - Enhanced 5G Vehicle to Vehicle Technologies for Safe and Reliable Connected Autonomous Vehicles Applications Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) holds great potentials for road safety and efficiency, but two major barriers need to be removed before its potentials can be fully unleashed: significantly enhanced vehicle to vehicle (eV2V) services with millimetre wave (mmWave) communications and reliable cooperative perception with autonomous vehicles (AV) sensors. However, the directional connectivity of mmWave presents new challenges for the whole protocol stack of V2V networks, while reliable cooperative perception requires novel design of deep learning (DL) models for object detection and fusion of sensor data from neighbour AVs. The above challenges underpinned by CAV demand a holistic design and tight integration of connected vehicles (CV) and AV technologies. 
This innovative and multi-disciplinary project VESAFE will train the outstanding Fellow candidate to tackle the key challenges with complementary expertise and realize the full potentials of CAV. A novel cross-layer design is proposed for the research of 5th generation (5G) eV2V schemes with mmWave and reliable cooperative perception for advanced CAV safety applications: the eV2V schemes are AV oriented and greatly assisted by the AV cooperative perception, and the reliable cooperative perception is boosted by the awareness of V2V network conditions. And this project propose a novel integrated evaluation of 5G eV2V and CAV applications to support system design and performance characterization. Through the cutting-edge research, this innovative project will produce robust eV2V schemes and reliable cooperative perception solutions, make breakthrough on 5G V2V and CAV safety applications.

"Title: Pearls Constellation - A next generation telecommunication platform based on a nano-satellites constellation Abstract: Despite broad expansion of mobile networks, coverage gaps remain due to a lack of ICT infrastructure: 0.72bn people globally still lack access to basic voice and text services, with around 3.9bn (53% of the world’s population) lacking access to the internet at 3G speeds. The majority of these uncovered populations are low income and live in rural regions of Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Current solutions for communication service in rural areas are based on large communication satellites (3,000 kg), leading to lengthy and costly development, as well as high costs of production, launch and operation. The central challenge in reaching uncovered communities is overcoming the unfavorable cost- benefit equation related to installing an operative communication infrastructure (with launch, maintenance and operating costs), whilst providing reliable and affordable communication. 
With a sophisticated and revolutionary telecommunication network infrastructure leveraging nanosatellite technology, the Pearls constellation of 200 nano-satellites will provide affordable and reliable communication services anywhere within the Equatorial band. An advanced space technology, combined with a complex software infrastructure, provides a robust satellite communication platform that can be accessed at a low price and from any commercial cell phone. SAS’s goal is to provide affordable communication services and coverage to billions of people living along the equator who currently have no access to simple communication service. 
During the feasibility assessment, a detailed scale-up plan to the constellation of 200 nano-satellites will be set up, and a supply chain will be established, as well as plan for the launch of 200 nano-satellites will be drafted.

"Title: SAFE-10-T - Safety of Transport Infrastructure on the TEN-T Network Abstract: The SAFE-10-T project will develop a Safety Framework to ensure high safety performance while allowing longer life-cycles for critical infrastructure across the road, rail and inland waterway modes. Moving from considering critical infrastructure such as bridges, tunnels and earthworks as inert objects to being intelligent (self-learning objects) the SAFE-10-T project will provide a means of virtually eradicating sudden failures. This will be achieved by:

•	The Safety framework will incorporate remote monitoring data stored in a BIM model that feeds into a decision support framework (DST) that enables decisions to be made automatically with maintenance prioritised for elements exhibiting stress.
•	A major advance that will be achieved in the project is that the algorithms at an object level and at a network level will incorporate machine learning to train the system to evolve with time using available monitoring data. 
•	A trans-disciplinary approach with experts in Artificial Intelligence and big data management working with owners, engineers with expertise in risk and modelling and sociologists  to make decisions.
•	Our major European infrastructure managers (Rijkswaterstaat for roads and inland waterways and Network Rail) will undertake demonstration projects at critical interchanges and nodes of the TEN-T transport network.

The project will achieve significant impact in asset management by:

(i)	By moving to intelligent objects that communicate their safety condition during extreme events we will provide a means of virtually eradicating sudden catastrophic failure of infrastructure objects.
(ii)	The project will use Open Linked Data formats to manage all data and inputs from other sources. Mitigation actions can be taken and warnings of the increased risk level can be transmitted to other agencies and the public.

"Title: UPDWMI - Ultra-low Power Digital circuits for Wireless Medical Implants Abstract: Advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to implant ultra-small electronic sensors in the human body. Interfacing with organs and nervous system, these devices will be a key part of future healthcare technologies. One of the most important components in such a device is the electronic integrated circuit (IC) located right at the signal source. This determines the overall power consumption and size of an implant. However, due to the need for sensitive analog circuits and toxicity concerns, very advanced silicon technology nodes (as in consumer electronics) cannot be used in such ICs. Hence, the power & area consumption is of significant concern. The primary aim of the project is to develop custom, novel ultra-low power digital cells for efficient signal processing and communication circuits for miniature wireless medical implants. This goal fits ideally with the ongoing IMPACT project (in the same group) that aims to develop rice-grain size bio-electronic sensor to monitor cancer tumors. This project will be able to use custom digital cells to optimize this tradeoff between data compression and transmission bandwidth in such a device. The researcher will  interact with a multidisciplinary team working on the IMPACT project,  including IC designers, physicist, biochemist and clinicians. The highly interdisciplinary work will consider the limitations of such an implant in terms of its sensor functionality and physiological acceptance before deriving the electrical specifications.

A new networking paradigm known as Network Slicing has emerged for 5G as the most promising approach to address this challenge by enabling per slice management of virtualized resources. 5G-TRANSFORMER aims to bring the “Network Slicing” paradigm into mobile transport networks by provisioning and managing MTP slices tailored to the needs of vertical industries. Specifically: automotive, healthcare and media. The technical approach is twofold: (1) Enable Vertical Industries to meet their service requirements within customised MTP slices; and (2) Aggregate and Federate transport networking and computing fabric, from the edge up to the core and cloud, to create and manage MTP slices throughout a federated virtualized infrastructure. The proposed solution defines three novel building blocks that will be developed and demonstrated integrating the aforementioned three vertical industries:
(1) Vertical Slicer as the logical entry point (i.e., one stop shop) for verticals to support the creation of their respective transport slices in a short time-scale (in the order of minutes).

"Title: ARDITO - Access to rights data via identification technologies optimisation Abstract: Everything is digital today in the creative industries value network. The production process, often the products, the supply chains, and the communication with end users.
The digital world calls for fast and cross-border re-use of creative content in different contexts, at different levels of granularity, for different purposes.
However there is a dark lacuna when it comes to the digital content value network – everything is digital except the actual functioning of the rights supply chains to enable such re-use. When users wish to re-use content, it is very hard to find information on who to ask for permission, which licenses are available, and on which terms and conditions.
This is where the ARDITO project comes into play. The project vision is that any user should be able easily to access such rights information. To obtain this, we need a Rights Data Network (RDN), a network of connected e-infrastructures to automate the exchange of information about rights. We do not start from scratch. The Linked Content Coalition initiative has defined the framework. The RDI project has demonstrated how such RDN could implement the LCC framework; and the Copyright Hub has provided a first implementation of such principles.
The time to go live with actual services is now. A group of SMEs, well established in different creative sectors (books, audio-visual and images), a research centre and the Copyright Hub Foundation decided to promote the ARDITO idea to accelerate the development of the RDN, through optimising a range of content identification technologies (watermarks, content recognition, DOIs) for use in the RDN, integrating them into the Copyright Hub ecosystem, and developing new services, ready to bring to the market.
The services are varied but share the same vision: to be an access point to the RDN offered to different markets. The final aim is to support SMEs in European creative industries in promoting new business ideas through monetising the re-use of their content.","[""data networks""]"

"Title: ICT4CART - ICT Infrastructure for Connected and Automated Road Transport Abstract: ICT4CART, totally aligned with the work programme, is providing an ICT infrastructure to enable the transition towards road transport automation. To meet this high level objective ICT4CART is bringing together, adapting and improving technological advances from different industries, mainly telecom, automotive and IT. It adopts a hybrid communication approach where all the major wireless technologies, i.e. cellular, ITS G5 and LTE-V, are integrated under a flexible “sliced” network architecture. This architecture will ensure performance and resilience for different groups of applications according to the needs of higher levels of automation (L3 & L4). On top of that, a distributed IT environment for data aggregation and analytics will be implemented. This offers seamless integration and exchange of data and services between all the different actors, allowing 3rd parties to develop, deliver and provide innovative services, thus creating new business opportunities. Cyber-security and data privacy aspects will be duly considered throughout the whole ICT infrastructure. In addition, novel accurate localisation services, exploiting the cellular network and information from other sources, such as on-board sensors, especially in complex areas (e.g. urban), will be addressed. Standardisation and interoperability are of high interest within ICT4CART in order to ensure the impact of the project towards enabling the transition to higher levels of automation. In this context issues related to the frequency spectrum will be investigated, while through the organisation of relevant workshops the engagement of policy makers and public authorities is ensured. To achieve its objectives ICT4CART, instead of working in generic solutions with questionable impact, it builds on four specific high-value use cases (urban and highway) which will be demonstrated and validated under real-life conditions at the test sites in Austria, Germany, Italy and across the Italian-Austrian border.","[""mobile network""]"
"Title: BEATRICE - Beyond Massive MIMO: Living at the Interface of Electromagnetics and Information Theory Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MaMi) is now a core technology for 5G networks. With MaMi, we refer to systems with an unconventionally large number (e.g. hundreds or even thousands) of base station antennas simultaneously serving tens (or even hundreds) of users. To date, the development of MaMi has been exclusively based on information theory (IT) tailored towards cellular communications. While IT is undoubtedly a versatile mathematical tool, it is based on mathematical logic. This theoretical framework now needs to be extended and reshaped to: (i) account for the unique electromagnetic (EM) properties and (ii) incorporate the main feature of future MaMi-based communication systems, namely their capability of sensing the system’s response to the radio waves, and thereby informing its modification. Looking ahead, MaMi will have far more general applications: optical communications, radar, and wireless power transfer to name a few. The grand question that the proposed research will address is: Are the existing IT tools sufficient to understand the physical phenomena and develop the upcoming generation of MaMi-based systems in ten years from now? BEATRICE will address this fundamental question by unifying EM theory and IT and pave the way for an extended range of applications supported by massive antenna arrays after 2025.

The specific project objectives are to:

O1)	Redefine the information theoretic modelling of concurrent and future MaMi-based systems using knowledge of unique EM characteristics, thereby quantifying their realisable potential. 
O2)	Develop new topological designs and modulation techniques for robust communication by harnessing knowledge about the EM properties of the transceivers and the propagation medium.
O3)	Leverage the world-class T&M facilities at QUB, to design, fabricate and measure novel array topologies which will be able to support a plethora of MaMi-based applications.","[""5G"", ""radar""]"
"Title: SICIS - Secure Indoor Communication empowered by Intelligent reflecting Surface Abstract: Due to the broadcast nature of transmission in the air, wireless communications are particularly vulnerable to security threats. Being an emerging wireless communication technology, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is able to achieve fine-grained passive reflect beamforming to constructively enhance the desired signal power at legitimate users and destructively deteriorate the reception at eavesdroppers. Therefore, IRS represents an excellent opportunity to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless communications in indoor environments, where over 80% of wireless traffic takes place. In order to achieve the full potential of IRS for secure indoor communications, breakthroughs in the fundamental theory and key techniques for IRS-aided secure indoor communications are urgently needed, including 1) channel estimation and MIMO channel modelling for indoor environments in presence of IRS; 2) joint beamforming design at both transmit antennas and IRS to maximise the secrecy performance; and 3) performance evaluation and optimisation of key parameters of IRS for secure indoor communications at a system level. In this project, we aim to make breakthroughs in these directions and bring the benefits of secure indoor wireless communications empowered by IRS to billions of users (people and things).","[""radio technology""]"

"Title: Do CHANGE - Do Cardiac Health: Advanced New Generation Ecosystem Abstract: The primary objective of Do CHANGE is to develop a health ecosystem for integrated disease management of citizens with high blood pressure and patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure. The system will give them access to a set of personalized health services in a near real-time fashion. This disruptive system will incorporate behavior change methods, such as “Do Something Different”, in conjunction with new innovative wearable/portable tools that can scan nature and volume of food and fluid intake, monitor behavior and clinical parameters in normal living situations. 
The objectives will be achieved by empowering patients with (1) tools and services, made available on smartphone or tablet and (2) the full control over the personal data they share with carers. To that extend a cyclic co-design methodology with end-users and health care professionals will be followed during the entire project. 
At the same time innovative end-user tools, including (1) a smart spatula for salt measurement, (2) a new artifact for fluid measurement and (3) a wearable food scan micro-spectrometer device, will be tested, (re-)designed and evaluated with patients and health professionals in Spain, NL and Taiwan. In view of the better balanced patient-care relationship, the traditional e-health telemonitoring will be enhanced with end-to-end trust assured transactions, secure storage, and ethical analytics of personal health data, making the patient an genuine stakeholder in his own cure processes and the ethical integration point of his own data. 
The proposal will be highly relevant to PCH 26 (ii): citizens’ life-style, socio-cultural values are continuously taken into account and a new range of mHealth tools is developed including a disruptive one from Taiwan. By providing concrete behavioral alternatives the new system will help patients to adhere to medical recommendations.

"Title: ORACLE - ORigin determination and improved detectAbility of Celestial-to-Local phEnomena by the VLF technique Abstract: The lower ionosphere (70–90 km), a ionized region in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, can be understood as a membrane acting as a sensor to different kinds of phenomena originating at Earth (e.g., lightning) or in space (e.g., space weather). Unexpected strong changes in this region can influence dramatically the performance and reliability of navigation and communication. However, the impact of those phenomena in this region is difficult to quantify accurately. On one hand, this region is too high for balloons and on the other hand it is too low for satellites. In this project, Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio waves will be used because they propagate between the Earth surface and the ionosphere with low attenuation. The researcher will push forward novel scientific understanding of the properties of the lower ionosphere and magnetosphere. She will: (1) determine whether the day-to-day variability of the VLF signal during sunrise can be explained by the ozone variability at its upper boundary, (2) find the yet unknown generation mechanism of VLF banded emissions, and (3) improve the detectability of galactic gamma-ray bursts, known as the most energetic phenomena in the universe. The project is strongly multidisciplinary, involving perspectives and concepts from astrophysics, magnetospheric, ionospheric, atmospheric physics and big data handling. This will be developed by the researcher within the frame of interaction and cooperation with the host and secondments. The results of this proposal have the potential to convey new perspectives in ionospheric and magnetospheric studies and provide some answers to long standing issues within the field of space weather, which has become of central importance in many aspects of human life and industry. As a consequence, by completing this action, Europe will improve its know-how in the topic of this proposal and reinforce its position on a global scale.

LSAAs will increase the physical dimension of the base station (BS), generating negative consequences on weight, wind load and visual impact. A potential solution of deploying LSAA indoors is to embed it into building structures, e.g., concrete walls. However, how the concrete impacts the wireless performance of concrete embedded antenna array (CEAA) has not been well studied. In this project, we will investigate how the electromagnetic (EM) properties of concrete will impact the wireless performance of CEAAs, and how to design and optimise the building properties of concrete to achieve both desirable mechanical and wireless performance. First, we will define metrics so that the wireless performance of CEAA can be measured. EM properties of concrete and the inhomogeneity of EM properties will be taken into account. Then, we will establish the relationship between the ratio and layout of admixtures and the EM properties of concrete. Three simplified concrete model, i.e., multilayer, lattice and 3D Poisson point process (PPP) models, will be proposed and verified through simulations and measurements. Finally, we will design concrete with desirable EM properties by changing the ratio and layout of admixtures under the constraint of mechanical performance to obtain an optimal wireless performance. After the completion of this project, we will be able tell how to optimize wireless performance of concrete under the constraint of its mechanical performance for typical building structures.","[""mobile network"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: ViSionRF - ViSionRF: Vital Signal Monitoring using Radio-Frequency Technologies – Standard IF-RI Abstract: Dementia is a syndrome in which there is cognitive function deterioration and memory loss. Alzheimer's disease consists or contributes to 60–70% of dementia cases. At present, worldwide around 50 million people have dementia, but nearly 10 million new cases are added every year. The total number of people suffering from dementia is projected to reach 82 million in 2030 and 152 million by 2050 – a 3-fold increase. This puts tremendous pressure on the healthcare system and society as a whole. Equally important, dementia is overwhelming for patients' families and their carers, as they require full-time care and watch. For all these reasons it timely and imperative to develop a low-cost and efficient full-time health monitoring solution.

The goal of this research is to develop an unobtrusive system Suite (ViSionRF) that will be able to capture the vital physiological signals of users (breathing, heart rate, heart beat shape, body position), remotely by using low-power radar, Wi-Fi and RFID signal technologies.  Envision a home with a single remote and unobtrusive device that acts as a stethoscope, heart monitor, irregular breath detector, and posture sensor. Such a home would have the ability to monitor your breathing, your heart (rate and pulse shape), and your position and alert your doctor when an emergency occurs. Such a home would help tremendously impaired citizens (e.g. dementia patients) and their carers.

Unlike traditional patient monitoring systems that require users to ‘wear’ devices and sensors, the proposed system does not require wearing any wearable electronic or on-body sensor. This maximizes mobility and makes the system completely transparent to the user. This is important as dementia sufferers repeatedly forget or decline to ‘wear’ their sensors. The goal will be achieved by developing a hybrid technology that merges Wi-Fi, radar and RFID responses with advanced signal processing algorithms that are further trained using powerful machine learning.","[""radar"", ""WiFi""]"
"Title: SMARTER-2 - Surveillance of MARiTime surroundings through lasER technology Abstract: Contact and collision incidences are now the most increasing, most frequent and overall the most costly type of accidents in the maritime transport sector, representing 40% of yearly insurance claims and force 1 out of 10 ships to an unplanned dry dock every year costing on average €400,000 per incident. Semi and fully submerged objects are particularly causing havoc to shipping and offshore platforms because they go undetected by state-of-the-art sensors (radars, sonars, optical sensors) presenting an acute need for improved observation capability of the ocean surface layer. A major concern considering the importance of shipping in general (90% of world’s trade), their asset value (up to € 1 Billion cost to build) and the number of people at sea (about 2 Billion transported yearly). Similarly, the maritime security situation is worsening forcing vessels in average to spend €170,000 a year on security related solutions. The project opportunity arises from today’s inability to observe this challenging ocean layer, causing unsatisfying operational risks in a greatly expanding market (with more frequent and more costly security and safety incidents in line with the strong industry expansion). These incidents can be reduced by an appropriate observational sensor like a ladar. It can detect for example drifting growlers (ice floes) or floating containers ahead of a vessel, preventing damaging collisions. The information that the sensor collects can also be directly used for operators to reduce operational cost, for example by accurately observing the sea state as to optimize sail plan models and vessel trim for fuel and emission savings. Such benefits have value for the operators, allowing them to purchase a relatively low cost sensor compared to the costs of an offshore or maritime incident. Moreover, the ladar is complementary to radar, sonar, and other maritime sensors. It would therefore fill a market gap rather than outcompeting existing sensor technologies.","[""radar""]"
"Title: OxfordNano - Implementing Special Nanomaterials in Ultra-performance Mobile Radomes Abstract: OxfordNano aims to enhance the EU manufacturing capability in aerospace composite structures using special nanomaterials (NMs) technology derived from ERC research. The target application for this capability is ultra-performance radomes for airborne sensors systems and a growing opportunity to deliver digital services to users on the move e.g. passengers in civil aircraft and trains.
Mobile radomes for the aviation industries need to be strong in structure and impact, lightweight and easily formed to aerodynamic shapes, and be resistant to erosion and lightning. Above all the radome must be transparent i.e. have the minimum insertion losses for that operational frequency range.
In the last 40 years, a range of insulating materials such as ceramics and resin composites have been used to optimise properties such as durability against environment yet possessing maximum and/or tunable radio frequency transparencies. However, in advanced high-mobility applications utilisation of modern lightweight nanocomposites as structural materials for radomes with superior toughness, thermal properties and other functionalities are essential.
OxfordNano’s European Industry project partners in the areas of advanced materials, composite manufacturing and radome design will apply speciality NMs to solve the formidable technical problems in engineering multifunctional composites for radomes, where conventional materials and engineering approaches are reaching the limit of their impact.
There has been much recent progress in understanding NMs formation and scaled-up production techniques from laboratory scale to industrial scale manufacturing. Many technical barriers have been identified in this area of research. At present there is no known commercial technology using h-BN multi-wall nanotubes (BNNTs) at scale.

This high-level objective is detailed as four major technical objectives: (i) create a standardised Europe-wide piloting environment for automated driving (ii) coordinate activities across the piloting community to acquire the required  data (iii) pilot, test, and evaluate automated driving functions and connected automation (iv) innovate and promote AD for wider awareness and market introduction. The European automotive sector must remain competitive in vehicle automation in the face of increasing competition from the US and Asia. Only by joining forces in pilot testing and evaluation of AD systems with real users will European industry meet the challenge coming from overseas. The project will focus on large-scale piloting of SAE Level 3 functions, with additional assessment of some Level 4 functions. The functionality of the systems used is exposed to variable conditions in 11 European countries, 100 vehicles and 1000 test drivers. The approach will be to adapt the FESTA methodology for testing automated driving needs. The tested functions cover a wide range from parking to overtaking, and urban intersection driving. Due to its large coverage of driving situations, L3Pilot is unique, and the first project which will demonstrate and test such a comprehensive menu of automated driving functions. The data collected will also be made available for third parties outside the consortium, for further use. The evaluation of the data will focus on technical, user acceptance, driving and travel behaviour, impact on traffic and society. The project promotion will include user outreach campaigns with four showcases, and the creation of a comprehensive guideline - a Code of Practice - with best practices for the development of automated driving functions.","[""5G""]"
"Title: ThoR - TeraHertz end-to-end wireless systems supporting ultra high data Rate applications Abstract: Data traffic densities of several Tbps/km2 are already predicted for 5G networks. To service a fully mobile and connected society networks beyond 5G must undergo tremendous growth in connectivity, data traffic density and volume as well as the required multi-level ultra-densification. The ThoR project will provide technical solutions for the backhauling/fronthauling of this traffic. The ThoR consortium brings together the leading Japanese and European players from industry, R&D and academia, whose prior work defines the state-of-the-art in high data rate long range point-to-point THz links. This team has been instrumental in defining and implementing the new IEEE 802.15.3d Standard “100 Gbps Wireless Switched Point-to-Point Physical Layer.” ThoR’s technical concept builds on this standard, in a striking and innovative combination using state-of-the-art chip sets and modems operating in the standardized 60 and 70 GHz bands, which are aggregated on a bit-transparent high performance 300 GHz RF wireless link offering >100 Gbps real-time data rate capacity. ThoR will apply European and Japanese state-of-the-art photonic and electronic technologies to build an ultra-high bandwidth, high dynamic range transceiver operating at 300 GHz combined with state-of-the-art digital signal processing units in two world-first demonstrations:  a)>100 Gbps P2P link over 1 km at 300 GHz using pseudo data in indoor and outdoor controlled environments b)>40 Gbps P2P link over 1 km at 300 GHz using emulated real data in a live operational communication network.This will require specific THz PHY technology advances (KETs) in photomixers, amplifiers including Travelling Wave Tube amplifiers, receivers, upconverters and channel aggregation. The success of ThoR will represent the first operational use of THz frequencies in ICT and this influential and powerful consortium will directly influence and shape the frequency regulation activities beyond 275 GHz through agenda item 1.15 of WRC 2019.","[""5G"", ""radio technology""]"
"Title: ORPHEUS - Object-based broadcasting – for European leadership in next generation audio experiences Abstract: Object-based media is a revolutionary approach for creating and deploying interactive, personalised, scalable and immersive content, by representing it as a set of individual assets together with metadata describing their relationships and associations. This allows media objects to be assembled in groundbreaking ways to create new user experiences. Based on this paradigm, ORPHEUS specifically identified the, often neglected, audio sector to have high innovation potential.

ORPHEUS will develop, implement and validate a completely new end-to-end object-based media chain for audio content. The partners will lay the foundation for facilitating infinite combinations of audio objects in ways that are flexible and responsive to user, environmental and platform-specific factors. This includes innovative tools for capturing, mixing, monitoring, storing, archiving, playing out, distributing and rendering object-based audio.

Many media companies, including partners of this project, are ready to adopt this next-generation media representation but the challenges of real-world implementation and integration are yet to be tackled.

ORPHEUS will deliver a sustainable solution, ensuring that workflows and components for object-based audio scale up to enable cost-effective commercial production, storage, re-purposing, play-out and distribution. The ultimate aim is to bring the fascinating experience of object-based content to mass audiences at no added cost. ORPHEUS will demonstrate the new prodigious user experience through the realisation of close-to-market workflows, proofing the economic viability of object-based audio as an emerging media and broadcast technology. Collectively, the project partners encompass all knowledge and skills necessary to achieve these objectives.

To further foster the development of new capabilities in the European content creation industry, ORPHEUS will publish a reference architecture and guidelines on how to implement object-based audio chains.","[""radio and television"", ""telecommunications""]"
"Title: ARCADIAN-IoT - Autonomous Trust, Security and Privacy Management Framework for IoT Abstract: The deployment of IoT systems are increasing worldwide, but so does security incidents like ransomware and cyber-extortion, which are not sufficiently covered by current cybersecurity practices and will proliferate with upcoming technologies like 5G. At the same pace, attacks are becoming more sophisticated, requiring reinforced cybersecurity competencies, as well as more effective mechanisms for detection and mitigation of attacks. ARCADIAN-IoT established the goal to develop and make available an innovative, advanced framework for trust, security and privacy management in IoT systems to promote trustworthy IoT systems. ARCADIAN-IoT will accelerate the development towards decentralized, transparent and user controllable privacy in three real use cases: Emergency and vigilance using drones and IoT; Monitoring of grid infrastructure; and medical IoT devices for telemonitoring and follow-up of cancer patients. ARCADIAN-IoT aims to fill a gap in the IoT threat intelligence landscape by providing a novel IoT- specific Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) approach, which supports integrated, automated and privacy- preserved IoT threat information sharing. ARCADIAN-IoT will research distributed ledger technologies to enable decentralized trust management and will leverage on federated AI for effective cybersecurity solutions complying with privacy regulations. ARCADIAN-IoT will act as an enabler of IoT systems in future networks by including eSIM technology with over the air management support for devices, and to enhance identity management through trusted hardware – Root of Trust (RoT).
