As AVs are likely to be deployed in mixed traffic, they need to interact safely and efficiently with other (non-equipped) users, including manually driven vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. Although obstacle detection by AVs is almost flawless, these vehicles cannot communicate their intentions to other road users. This limitation currently reduces their appeal and value to the user. To ensure intuitive and cooperative interaction between the AV and others, and a smooth flow of all traffic, it is essential that there is good means of communication between all actors. The main objective of interACT is to substantially improve this communication and cooperation strategy. interACT will provide an overview of current human-machine interactions in mixed traffic, and increase chances of safe deployment of AVs by developing novel software and HMI hardware components for reliable and user-centric communication between an AV with its users. interACT will: \n1) Use social-psychological models to compile a catalogue of interactions, identifying the main communication needs of road users in current and future traffic scenarios \n2) Improve software algorithms and sensor capabilities for assessing intention recognition and behaviour prediction of surrounding road users \n3) Use a Cooperation and Communication Planning Unit to integrate planning algorithms, providing synchronized and integrated communication protocols \n4) Ensure safety of road users by developing easy-to-verify software for a safety layer, and novel methods for fail-safe trajectory planning. \nPrototypes will be developed and evaluated in multi-actor simulators and two test vehicles, assessing ease-of-use, acceptance, safety and reliability. The impact of this successful communication on reduction of crashes, improvement of traffic flow and acceptance of AVs by society will be investigated.",

Owing to growing underwater activities, e.g., undersea oil & gas exploration, and Internet of underwater things, reliable water-to-air wireless communications are urgently needed by the industry, military, and scientific communities. As it is difficult to use a single type of signal, e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), or optical, for communication across a water-air interface, most existing water-to-air communications rely on sonobuoys to relay acoustic signals from underwater transmitters to RF receivers on/above the water surface. The global sonobuoy market is predicted to reach $595.9 million at a 6.62% CAGR over the period 2018-2023. Since sonobuoys might not be recovered from remote, hostile areas of the ocean, battery-powered sonobuoys (which have battery packs full of toxic metals) are posing a great threat to the marine environment. Although energy-harvesting technologies (e.g., photovoltaic, wave action, or seawater based semi-fuel cell) have been developed for sonobuoys to charge onboard energy storage systems, the challenge of miniaturizing and incorporating these technologies into the sonobuoy volume constraint remains a dominant issue. \nThis project will develop novel water-to-air backscatter communication (WABCom) technology to enable the design of lightweight, battery-free sonobuoys by leveraging RF backscatter communications, where the RF energy harvested by the sonobuoy from an unmanned aerial vehicle\u2019s (UAV) transmission is used to support the circuit operation at the sonobuoy, and the sonobuoy forwards the received underwater signal to the UAV via an RF backscatter link (i.e., by modulating the signal on the RF waveform reflected back to the UAV). Such miniature battery-free sonobuoys can be flexibly deployed (e.g., air-dropped by UAVs) where and when needed and are disposable with minimum impact on the marine environment.",

However, vertical industries today can only verify use cases in small scales in commercial environments, before investing in large scale deployments. Through ICT-17 projects 5G infrastructures become available to verticals to test their applications, however large-scale trials are still not possible. 5G-VICTORI will conduct large scale trials for advanced vertical use case verification focusing on Transportation, Energy, Media and Factories of the Future and cross-vertical use cases. It leverages 5G network technologies developed in 5G-PPP Phase-1 and Phase-2 projects 5G-XHaul and 5G-PICTURE and exploits extensively existing facilities interconnecting main sites of all ICT-17 infrastructures i.e. 5G-VINNI, 5GENESIS and 5G-EVE and the 5G UK test-bed in a Pan-European Infrastructure.

Still, the current Internet can only evolve adequately, if its infrastructure can be devised to accommodate the emerging services. The increased cost of adding new infrastructure and capacity has a drastic effect on rural and remote communities as well as nomadic users as they become marginalized by not gaining access to crucial Internet services. Our goal is to make the Future Internet universally pervasive supporting a diverse set of services. To achieve this, we develop a universal mobile-centric and opportunistic communications architecture, which integrates the principles of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking (ICN) in a common framework. We utilize the benefits of both ICN and DTN to enable resource exploitation at minimal bandwidth, opportunistic access to information and more localized access to information through novel caching strategies. UMOBILE focuses on assisting users in getting access to the content they want or content that may be of shared interest to their trust circles. By relying on an instance of the UMOBILE architecture, users are able to share information directly with other peers without relying on infrastructure or expensive connectivity services. The proposed architecture targets the mobile part of the networks, extends Internet connectivity to regions that are not typically covered enhancing network resilience and is fully backward compatible with the current Internet architecture.

My project addresses that problem by adopting a highly successful approach hat has been employed in (opto)electronics, which has led to the explosion of a new prolific scientific field, new technologies, and new products: the development of solution-based processing methods. Specifically, I propose to produce a step change in the photonics field through the employment of the Dynamic Templating Process (DTP), an elegant, fully solution-processing method, which exploits the self-assembly of water microdroplets, to create micro-honeycombs, i.e. 2D photonic crystals. As solution-processable material, I propose to use an organic:inorganic hybrid, which shows refractive indexes above 2. Then, I aim to create novel 2D hierarchical and 3D photonic structures based on thy hybrid honeycombs for optical field management. In the last stage I will transform the DTP into an industrially scalable process for photonic crystal and device manufacturing. Thereby, I propose an ambitious, multidisciplinary and self-consistent project, which encompasses the synthesis of novel materials, the development of microprocessing methods, the production and characterisation of a new class of photonic elements, and the development of industrial production processes.

Previous attempts to either grow NCs inside glass by a glass heat treatment or incorporate NCs during glass formation showed unconvincing results. In our nanosintering process, key enabling steps include reducing the sintering temperature, developing specialized NC core-shell structures and adjusting the glass composition, thus achieving a chemically inert environment and matching the refractive index of NCs and glass. This technology will be exploited to produce low-loss, NC-functionalized glass fibres. Fibre lasers are energy efficient and compact and offer maintenance-free operation, ultra-short pulses, high power, and low noise. Today\u2019s commercial fibre lasers are fabricated from robust, durable silica glass. The operation of oxide fibre lasers can be extended to an enormous spectral range (~400\u20133000 nm) by doping oxide glasses with laser-active nanocrystals optimized for particular laser wavelengths, thus enabling a huge variety of new applications.

Secondly it ranks critical alerts based on the potential damage the attack can inflict on the threatened assets and hence to the organisations business. High impact alerts that target important hosts will have a higher priority than other alerts.

From radio-frequency ion traps to optical tweezing of colloidal particles, existing methods to trap matter in free space or solution rely on the use of external fields that often strongly perturb the integrity of a macromolecule in solution. Recently, I invented the \u2018electrostatic fluidic trap\u2019, a \u201cfield-free\u201d principle that supports stable, non-destructive confinement of single macromolecules in room temperature fluids, representing a paradigm shift in a nearly century-old field. The spatio-temporal dynamics of a single electrostatically trapped molecule reveals fundamental information on its properties, e.g., size and electrical charge. The charge of a macromolecule is in turn a strong function of its 3D conformation - the molecular basis of biological function. I now aim to develop a new platform to study 3D macromolecular structure and temporal conformation by measuring the electrical charge of a single trapped molecule in real time, using both optical microscopy and electrical detection. Beyond the conformational dynamics of a single molecule, we will also examine interactions between two or more molecules, and the detection of minute structural differences between closely related molecular isoforms. We will further develop a novel approach to electrical transport measurements on single molecules aimed at generating for the first time a catalog of \u2018electrical signatures\u2019 for biomolecules in solution.

It is a major contributor to EU GDP and its size continues to grow fueled by demand from consumers to many industries. Despite its many positive impacts, the industry also faces some challenges connected with the enormous quantity of raw materials that it needs for sustainability, the huge quantity of Waste Electrical, Electronics Equipment (WEEE) generated and the threat of competition from Asia. To sustain its growth, to manage the impact of WEEE and to face the competition from Asia, the industry needs innovations in key areas. One such area is the drive for ultra-miniaturisation/ultlra-functionality of equipment. The key current road block/limitation to achieving the goal of ultra-miniaturisation/functionality is how to increase the component density on the printed circuit board (PCB). This is currently limited by the availability of hyper fine pitch solder powder pastes. FineSol aims to deliver at first stage an integrated production line for solder particles with size 1-10 \u03bcm and to formulate solder pastes containing these particles. Thus, by proper printing methods (e.g. screen and jet printing) the fabrication of  PCBs with more than double component density will be achieved. Consequently, this would effectively enable more than a doubling of the functions available on electronic devices such as cell phones, satellite navigation systems, health devices etc. The successful completion of the FineSol project would lift the ultra-miniaturisation/functionality road block and also enable reduction in raw material usage, reduction in WEEE, reduction in pollution and associated health costs and also a major reduction in EU energy demand with all its indirect benefits for environment and society.",

Such a setting is mostly unexplored and this proposal will demonstrate the unique features of these waves and their general impact in broader physics. Eventually, this study will pave the way to a class of robust micro-combs which can be controlled with user-friendly machine learning approaches.",

The new compounds are particularly suitable for the fabrication of OLEDs via cheap solution-processing techniques and have so far reached 27% external quantum efficiency, a record for any solution-processed device. The new complexes have a linear, rotationally flexible structure, and it is this rotation that allows 100% of the excitation energy to be harvested, by a new emission mechanism (\u201crotationally accessed spin-state inversion\u201d, RASI). OLEDs are widely used as flat-screen displays (TVs, smartphones), a multi-billion dollar market worldwide.

Our emitters are compounds of copper, silver and gold, suitable as \u201cslot-in\u201d replacements of iridium. IPR is protected by two UK and one PCT World patent applications. The key discovery is that in certain types of coordination complexes based on carbene ligands the excited singlet state sinks below the excited triplet state during molecular rotation. To our knowledge this is the first realization of \"\"spin-state inverted\"\" materials, until now discussed only as a theoretical concept. The result is efficient, very fast light harvesting with highly desirable short (sub-microsecond) excitation lifetimes, leading to high display brightness (in prototypes 20 times brighter than a HD TV screen), with potential lighting applications.\"",

Moreover, the traditional radar distribution networks are realized with conventional cables or space-feeds that results in a massive, complex and inflexible system. To overcome these issues, the hybrid photonic-based radar system (PHRAD) emerges as a promising candidate, providing low-loss, immunity to EM interference and high bandwidth capacity. These robust properties of photonics play a vital role in realization of PHRAD transceiver with improved navigation and detection. Although, the possibility of multiband PHRAD, capable to work in both S-and X-band, becomes feasible that reduces the weight, size and cost of the system. Alternatively, the state-of-the-art electronic techniques have not the required potential to make such radars feasible. The key goal of the proposed project is to develop a PHRAD transceiver tunable over a wide frequency range (\u2265 40GHz) and immune to phase fluctuations in order to realize a robust navigation and detection system capable of providing high imagery-resolution and accuracy.  The proposed work will be carried out in three phases.  In phase I, Mode lock Lasers will be cultivated to generate wide-range and phase-stable radar signals in MMW. These wide-bandwidth signals (40-80GHz) will help to provide high imagery-resolution with accurate speed-computation of objects that lead to a reliable and secure navigation to the autonomous vehicles. In phase II, a multiband PHRAD transceiver will be designed to provide high frequency-flexibility that provides capability to track any frequency signal within S-or X-band. The phase III is dedicated to the implementation of the developed multiband PHRAD in real-time environment, especially in intelligent transport system (ITS), for its testing and evaluation.",

The ability to map signals efficiently from the microwave to optical regime becomes paramount for distant systems to communicate with each other using low loss telecom fibers. Both classical (radio over fiber systems) and quantum (linking two superconducting qubit processors in two dilution fridges) information processing systems will benefit greatly from the development of an efficient RF to optical signal transducer.\n I have been developing efficient RF to optical transduction schemes in GaAs cavity optomechanical systems (KC Balram et al., Nature Photonics (2016)) by exploiting its favorable piezoelectric (for coupling RF signals to propagating acoustic waves) and elasto-optic (for engineering strong acousto-optic interactions) properties. In this project, I would like to extend this work and address the issue of weak RF signal detection by up-converting RF signals to the optical domain using integrated Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and shot-noise limited optical detection. Piezoelectric SBS systems can also be used to build high frequency, high gain RF amplifiers with noise figures that can be lower than conventional RF amplifiers. Working in a novel GaAs on insulator platform helps provide some unique advantages (tightly confined acoustic and optical modes with large modal overlap and a large elasto-optic coefficient leading to significant Brillouin gain) while holding the potential for interfacing complex circuitry in a well-established III-V materials platform.",

Although over the years, these systems have become increasingly complex, the quality of optical system performance is still affected by the same key physical features: chromatic dispersion, fiber Kerr nonlinearity, and optical noise. Most of the current optical networks exploit the techniques that were originally developed for linear channels. Thus, it is not surprising that nonlinearity has a detrimental impact on such systems. It has been predicted that, within the next decade the existing optical fibre technology will approach the \"\"nonlinear transmission limit'', which caps the achievable rate of error-free data transmission.  Thus, in order to reach a the higher capacity of optical fibres it is necessary to shift the relevant information and communications technology paradigm by introducing truly nonlinear modulation, transmission, and signal processing techniques. The aim of this project is to develop ground-breaking visionary concepts and approaches to unlock the capacity of fiber-optic communications beyond the limits of current technology by treating optical fiber as the inherently nonlinear medium it is. Our paradigm-shifting approach is based on the concept mathematical notion of integrability and the related nonlinear Fourier transform-type processing of optical signal, which allow us to use of the fibre nonlinearity in a constructive way. This multidisciplinary project, grouping together the mathematical theory of intergability, advanced signal processing, the physics of nonlinear waves evolution, solitons, and noise interaction with nonlinear excitations, combined with the optical transmission methods and purposes, is aimed at the development of fundamentally new communication technologies to satisfy current and future technology challenges.\"",

It is well recognized nowadays that rapidly increasing data rates in the core fibre communication systems are quickly approaching the limits of current transmission technologies, many of which were originally developed for communication over linear (e.g. radio) channels. It is widely accepted that the nonlinear transmission effects in optical fibre represent now a major limiting factor in modern fibre-optic communication systems. Nonlinear properties make optical fibre channels considerably different from wireless and other traditional linear communications channels. There is a clear need for development of radically different methods for coding, transmission, and (pre & post) processing of information that take the nonlinear properties of the optical fibre into account and for training of a new generation of engineers with expertise in: optical communications, nonlinear science methods, digital signal processing (DSP), design of implementable algorithms.

Accurate forecasting of volcanic eruptions is problematic because 1) it relies on human interpretation at individual volcanoes, 2) a volcano can behave in unexpected ways not previously seen at that location, and 3) most volcanoes are not instrumented. DEEPVOLC will address this by i) applying artificial intelligence, ii) using data for all volcanoes worldwide, and iii) exploiting advances in satellite monitoring. A key indicator of potential volcanic activity is deformation of a volcano's surface due to magma migrating beneath. Surface movements as small as a few millimetres can now be measured from space, using satellite-borne radar. A recently-launched European satellite mission, Sentinel-1, has transformed our ability to measure surface deformation at all of the world's volcanoes, acquiring data at least twice every twelve days. However, forecasting how deforming volcanoes will behave in the future remains challenging. In this project I will apply recently developed deep learning approaches to the satellite data. This is an entirely new approach to forecasting volcanic activity, which currently relies on the individual expertise available at each observatory, and which is only now made possible due to the launch of Sentinel-1 and advances in deep learning algorithms. DEEPVOLC will combine knowledge from all volcanoes that have been active in the era of satellite deformation observations, and will continue to improve as it ingests data from new activity. The main deliverable will be a system for volcano observatories that uses knowledge of how volcanoes behave globally to automatically identify deformation at volcanoes locally, and forecast how the deformation will evolve, indicating the probability of eruption.",

In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than \u20ac60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector.

This trend is set to continue, as Europe further considers visa liberalization agreements in a bid to sustain their competitive stance in the global tourism market.

We will use non-thermal plasma, which has large potential to convert these small (low reactive) molecules under near ambient temperature and pressure, particularly for distributed processes based on renewable energy. The new processes have drastically lower carbon footprint (up to over 90% with respect to current ones). Furthermore, CO2 conversion is crucial for a world-based distribution of renewable energy. However, the selectivity and energy efficiency of plasma technologies for these reactions are too low, making radically new approaches necessary. \n\nThe Project idea is to realize a highly innovative approach for non-thermal plasma symbiosis with catalysis.

Access networks are essential part of the communication infrastructure as bridge between end-users and core networks. Their design must make possible the provision of real-time high-bandwidth access to Internet, essential for advanced communication services as immersive video and ubiquitous cloud computing. It is clearly foreseen that the only long-term solution to the problem involves optical fiber as transmission medium, the so called optical access networks. Passive optical network (PON) is the most widely employed technology because of the cost reduction it entails, but the capacity of actual time-division multiplexed PONs will be exhausted eventually as more bandwidth-hungry applications become available in the near future. Telecommunications carriers face the challenge of meeting the unprecedented bandwidth demand by end users at the same time the capital and operating expenditures requirements are reduced.\nINVENTION project targets the development of cost-effective and high capacity communication architectures for their employment on optical access/metro networks. The proposed concept will be based on the employment of coherent detection with low-cost and simplified optical receiver architectures, making sure that the proposed approaches meet the cost requirements of these optical networks. The proposed concepts will be implemented by a suitable combination of optical signal processing techniques and digital-signal-processing (DSP) algorithms, keeping the required DSP at realizable levels. The final scope of INVENTION is the proposal of mid-term and long-term solutions for the achievement of the objectives included in the digital agenda 2020 for the ICT strategy.",

The positive association between the rise in consumption of food prepared outside the home and the increasing prevalence of obesity has been described as a major health and wellbeing societal challenge. Attempts to increase public awareness of appropriate ways to eat more healthily unfortunately do not seem to have led to significant changes in patterns of food purchase and consumption especially from an eating \u2018out-of-home\u2019 situation. It has become obvious that the development of effective measures for improvement requires further systematic research and a radical approach. The aim of FoodSMART is to develop an innovative technical (ICT) menu solution that enables informed consumer choice when eating out that takes into account individual characteristics (such as culture, dietary requirements and age group) as well as product (specification) and environmental cues (choice architecture and consumption setting). \nThis aim will be achieved through the evaluation of consumer orientated intelligence (what information consumers require/trust i.e. information quality); the assessment of industry orientated intelligence (impact of customisation) and the subsequent development of data analytics and Quick Recognition (QR) coding for personalised food recommendation; thereby, facilitating the consumption of healthy and appropriate dishes. Results will be gathered and modelled to provide strategic intelligence for menu design and decision-making (by Industry) and for policy purposes (by the EU); further, this translational research will be disseminated both at scientific and consumer levels. Increasing the pace and scale of innovation within out-of-home eating is fundamental to this proposal.",

One of the treats to the maritime coast are small Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) which can carry explosives or which can be used for smuggling drugs, boats and human intruders on the sea shore. \n\nThe SafeShore core solution for detecting small targets that are flying at low attitude is to use a 3D LIDAR that scans the sky and creates above the protected area a virtual dome shield. SafeShore will also integrate the 3D LIDAR with passive acoustic sensors, passive radio detection and video analytics.\n\nOne of SafeShore specific objectives will be to cover 1500-m1800m along the coastal border. This will be done with 3 mobile platforms. Each one of those will cover itself with a dome-shaped virtual detection shield with a radius of about 250m to 300m. There will be approximately 50 meters overlapping between the platforms. The overlapping will create a continuous  detection shield along the shore. \n\nThe SafeShore objective will be to demonstrate the detection capabilities in the missing detection gaps of other existing systems such as costal radars, thereby also ensuring the fusion of information and increasing the situational awareness and better implementation of the European Maritime Security Strategy based on the information exchange frameworks, EUROSUR and EUCISE 2020. \n\nAll SafeShore objectives are measurable, realistic and achievable within the duration of the project, as the SafeShore project will build 3 prototypes that are going to assess the accomplishment of the objectives.

Microwave technology has tremendous simplification potential by condensing experimental effort from an optical table with several square meters of accurately aligned optical components down to an engineered conductor microstructure embedded into a chip surface and a few off-the-shelve microwave components. Thus, this technology can be the key enabling step for addressing the formidable challenge of a scalable quantum processor. Although the field is still in its infancy, there is rapid progress: a fidelity of over 99.9999% has been achieved for single-qubit gates and 99.7% for two-qubit gates. This technology allows execution of quantum gates by the application of a voltage to a microchip potentially replacing millions of laser beams and it can operate at room temperature or mild cooling. There are still enormous technical challenges in scaling ion trap (or any other) systems up to the millions of qubits required to implement meaningful full-sale quantum computation and simulation. The main objective of MicroQC is to demonstrate, through state-of-art quantum engineering, fast and fault-tolerant microwave two-qubit and multi-qubit gates and to design scalable technology components that apply these techniques in multi-qubit quantum processors. The successful accomplishment of these objectives, in a combined effort by five leading groups in this field \u2013 three experimental groups, including the pioneers in microwave quantum logic with static and oscillating magnetic gradients, and two leading theory groups \u2013 will make large-scale quantum computation and simulation with microwave-controlled microfabricated ion traps possible.

Small cell is a promising technology to address capacity crunch problem in-building. Glass is a popular material widely used in modern buildings. Considering the factors of aesthetics and stability, embedding antennas into glass can be a good choice for deploying small cells indoors. However, how the glass impacts the wireless performance of a glass embedded antenna has not been well investigated. In this project, we will study the influence of EM properties of glass on the wireless performance and will design and optimise glass to achieve desirable wireless performance while maintaining acceptable optical and thermal properties. First, we will define measurable wireless performance metrics for glass embedded antennas, where the radiation efficiency, bandwidth, radiation pattern, coverage, and signal to interference plus noise ratio will be taken into account. Then, we will bridge the gap between ingredient ratios and structures of glass and the wireless performance of the embedded antenna. Three glass structures including coated glass, laminated glass and doping glass will be modeled. Finally, we will develop a method that can obtain a trade-off among wireless, optical and thermal performances of glasses. The ingredient ratio and structure of glass will be optimised in term of wireless performance under the constraints of optical and thermal performances, so that the glass can be multifunctional and smart. After this project, the benefits and feasibility of glass embedded antenna arrays can be assessed and the key technology of optimising glass embedded antennas can be established.",

Abstract: To meet the high throughput demands envisaged for 5G networks, with increased user densification and bandwidth-hungry applications, while at the same time reducing energy consumption, iCIRRUS proposes an intelligent Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) that brings together optical fibre technology, low-cost but highly flexible Ethernet networking, wireless resource management for device-to-device (D2D) communication (incl. the use of mm-wave spectrum) and the use of virtual mobiles in the cloud. The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure. Finally, the intelligent network functions in ICIRRUS can interact with mobile cloud processing, and further offloads of infrastructure communications can be realised through virtualising mobiles in the cloud as clones, and performing communication tasks between clones.",

Compared to the conventional battery-powered communication networks, WPCN is in general more convenient by eliminating the hassle of connecting cables, more cost-effective by enabling on-demand energy supplies and maintenance-free operations, more environmental-friendly by avoiding tons of battery disposal yearly, and is sometimes essential for scenarios where manual battery replacement/recharging is too dangerous (e.g., in hazardous environment) or even impossible (e.g., for biomedical implants).  However, the practical deployment of WPCN is hampered by several critical issues, such as the low end-to-end WPT efficiency over a long  distance, the inter-play between power and information transmissions within the same network, and the challenges of scalability in large networks. This project aims to resolve the above issues by paving the way for the practical deployment of WPCN. Towards this end, a comprehensive study on WPCN will be pursued, ranging from the networking architecture and protocol designs to optimized resource allocation. A number of innovative techniques will be proposed and thoroughly investigated in this project, including the new heterogeneous networking architecture for WPCN, the harvest-and-transmit protocol facilitated by the concept of energy-and-information full-duplexing, and the distributed energy beamforming technique with the idea of WD-initiated WPT. The results obtained in this project will find a wide range of applications in the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication system, which involves numerous low-power WDs, including those in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), internet of things (IoT), and massive machine-type communications.",

Due to media convergence and global competition, media organizations now face challenges from disruptive technology and business models. New policy agendas require their proactive and coordinated attention.\nDespite these challenges, EU media players have many advantages: they produce much of the quality content shared on social media, invest heavily in R&D, and are well placed to launch dynamic collaborative innovations.\nTo further this substantial legacy, a consortium of public and commercial broadcasters, creative producers and research bodies now proposes to launch MediaRoad, a highly innovative coordination project with three interconnected Hubs:\n- The Sandbox Hub will enable media organizations to create a series of interlinked incubators, or Sandboxes, where SMEs can test and scale innovative concepts in operational environments. Each Sandbox will offer workspace, infrastructure and internal support for short periods. The Hub will create a toolkit, support Sandbox launches, and attract startups.\n- The Policy Hub will develop a policy vision for the whole radio and AV sector on topics such as the EU research agenda, data, 5G, security, immersive media, investment, training and regulatory issues. It will hold workshops, share updates, draft vision documents and link to other research projects.\n- The Network Hub will create a series of events to bring together broadcasters, researchers, content creators, technologists and entrepreneurs to inspire collaborations and share knowledge. Topics will include social media, post-convergence radio, multi-platform content, new audience measurements and robot journalism.\nMediaRoad will turn EU diversity into opportunities, help organizations become more competitive and ultimately benefit audiences with better content, better delivered.",

Horses and ponies are principally identified by a paper based \u2018passport\u2019, and/or micro-chip, or branding.  Passports are hand written and therefore prone to error, falsification and fraud. They can easily be \u2018recycled\u2019 from dead animals allowing contaminated horsemeat to enter the human food chain. Likewise, micro-chips can easily be removed or cloned. Purchasers of equidae have little assurance that \u2018their animal\u2019 is the one in the passport.\n\nEquine Register Ltd. are developing an exciting new equine identification method for vets, government agencies, welfare organisations and horse owners - EQR-Equid. Our solution uses an inclusive secure, remote-access data system underpinned by smart behavioural pattern recognition algorithms, that can automatically identify disease spread, criminal activity, missing animals and compliance issues. Via an intuitive interface, EQR-Equid allows equine sector stakeholders to identify and track an animal securely from anywhere, at any time, whilst enabling enforcement agencies to target their resources. EQR-Equid\u2019s accuracy, connectivity and immediacy will deliver increases in animal welfare, animal value, compliance and data confidence whilst reducing the opportunity for fraudulent activity.\n\nThe objective of our overall innovation project is to develop EQR-Equid for sale to those involved in the trade, enforcement, and welfare of equidae. The specific objectives of our Phase I project are to carry out a feasibility study to enable us to create a clear path for market replication.  Our sales forecast shows a projected turnover of \u20ac6.3m by 2023, 5 years after launch. The revenue will allow us to extend the concept to other animals, and grow Equine Register Ltd. as an SME.",

These biosensors will be designed as self-powered disposable test strips that combine the simplicity of lateral flow tests with quantitative readout, which is enabled by the implemented electrochemical detection method. As an application example, we will fulfil the consumer need for fast point-of-care discrimination between bacterial and viral infections.\nIn particular, IMPETUS will combine screen-, flexo- and inkjet-printing in a seamless roll-to-roll pilot line compatible to high-throughput fabrication. Here, the paper is employed as substrate for the printed circuits and a microchip, but also as active component of the printed battery as well as of the biosensor. This we will achieve by developing new technologies for paper manufacturing, coating and surface modification, and the respective processing will work hand in hand with the ink development (cellulose-based inks for fabricating the printed battery as well as bio-inks for surface functionalization and reagent deposition). A highly integrated and energy-efficient silicon microchip will be developed that enables electrochemical data acquisition, storage and contactless NFC transmission, and the microchip will be mounted onto the paper substrate by an inline placement process. \nIn summary, the IMPETUS pilot line will pave the way towards the real world application of paper-based quantitative electrochemical diagnostic test strips, thereby clearly advancing the current state-of-the-art, which up to now has mostly focussed on individual fabrication processes and device concepts.

However, the shortage of sufficient skilled labour and entrepreneurs capable of handling the highly multi-disciplinary nature of KETs remains a major problem in the EU. Tailoring of semiconductors at the nanoscale is an important enabling technology for a wide range of photonics and electronics applications in diverse areas. In the training network proposed here, a cohort of 15 early stage researchers will be trained in the full range of skills required for a career in photonics, including materials growth, device fabrication, characterisation, design, theory, and commercialisation. A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 8 academic partners, 2 full industry partners and 7 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be developed within four burgeoning research areas; Semiconductor Metamaterials & Plasmonics, Dilute Nitride semiconductor nanostructures, Hydrogenated Semiconductors and Metamorphic structures. The outcomes of this enabling fundamental research are well focused to deliver advances in sources for secure communications, sensitive detectors for security applications, more efficient solar cells for energy generation, LEDs and sensors for environmental gas and bio-sensing.

Reductions in the productivity of dryland savannahs have major social and political implications, and the United Nations (UN) has labelled the accurate quantification of savannah degradation as of high priority.\n\nMonitoring the woody component of savannah land cover is, therefore, needed to enhance the understanding of broad-scale changes in savannahs & their relationship with ecosystem degradation. Over large scales, this can only be achieved in a cost-effective manner using Earth Observation (EO) technologies. The development of SAV-EO is, therefore, proposed which will employ novel remote sensing methodologies, based on thousands of freely-available optical & radar satellite data for the mapping & monitoring of fractional woody cover over the entire southern African savannah region (1,500,000km2). A monitoring tool that identifies underlying land degradation processes, such as bush encroachment & deforestation, will also be devised based on a dense time-series analysis approach using all available data from the 45-year long Landsat archive. Another objective of SAV-EO is to provide an advancement in the design of operational indicators for the assessment & monitoring of land degradation, within the Land Degradation Neutrality framework suggested by the UN, in order to achieve the target of the Sustainable Development Goals to combat desertification by the 2030.\n\nThe innovative algorithms, data & outputs will be made available open-access via a bespoke web-GIS platform & numerous dissemination & communication activities, thus providing an invaluable resource for scientists & policy makers alike.",

However, the use of Photonics is currently restricted to a few demonstrations in non-critical equipment, due to their perceived immaturity compared to RF. RETINA will develop several key RF-photonic building blocks to TRL5-6, designing, fabricating and testing 1) multi-beam TTD phased array antennas for X band operation, 2) a photonic integrated beamforming network, 3) novel configuration active X-band antenna array and 4) miniaturized space-grade components and subsystems. Miniaturization will be achieved by integrating lasers and external modulators with electronics in the Tx side, integrating photodiodes, amplifiers and electronics at the Rx side and by fabricating a PIC beamformer.

For example, radar is too sensitive to metallic material, Lidar is too expensive and it does not work well on absorbing/reflective surfaces, GPS based methods are difficult in cities with high buildings, vehicle to vehicle communication cannot detect pedestrians or any objects unconnected, segmentation based vision methods are too computing power thirsty to be miniaturized, and normal vision sensors cannot cope with fog, rain and dim environment at night.

DOWN2EARTH is composed of a multidisciplinary project team that will deliver state-of-the-art and community relevant climate services that focus on water scarcity and its consequences at or near the Earth\u2019s surface (hence DOWN2EARTH) to increasingly vulnerable agro-pastoral populations in HAD. The project is designed to bolster existing climate services frameworks, improve decision support to governments and NGOs in the most vulnerable HAD countries (Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia), and to improve community-centric adaptation and resilience to climate change. The project will: assess the socio-economic dimensions and human dynamics of climate change including feedbacks between climatic shocks, human behavior, and policy implementation; characterize historical trends and future projections of water scarcity, food insecurity, population, and land use; develop and enhance multi-level decision-support tools that emphasize the translation of climate information into critical land and water information required for adaptation and resilience by end users and state/regional governments; and strengthen regional climate services through capacity building, citizen science, information dissemination, expansion of data networks, and policy implementation.",

This can be inefficient and cumbersome \u2013 clinic visits may be too infrequent to identify individuals at risk of significant changes in disease state (e.g. relapse) and place unnecessary burden on patients and providers.\n\nSmartphone and wearable technologies have led to an exponential growth in the amount of information which can be collected on patients unobtrusively and at low cost. Sensors collect data passively, and active monitoring, using experience sampling, provides information on multiple parameters. Such technologies could monitor long term outcomes of patients, at scale, and provide fine-grained information on outcomes, available in real time and at low-cost, enabling services to offer more responsive and efficient care. \n\nWhilst there is growing interest in the application of RMT in health, the field is in its infancy. The private-public partnership fostered by IMI2 is an ideal way to overcome the inherent challenges of this field.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through remote assessment. To achieve this we will create a pipeline for developing, testing and implementing RMT in depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. The pipeline will include a data management and modelling infrastructure applicable to other disorders and with the flexibility of design to be future-proofed against further technological innovation. We will provide data on implementation barriers and facilitators gleaned from patients, clinicians, regulator and payers which will optimise the pathways for regulatory approval and uptake. \n\nProgram of Work: In order to test the feasibility and predictive power of RMT four main components are required: (1) Excellent project oversight, management, and a dissemination and exploitation strategy;",

Abstract: All infrastructure that underpins life as we know it runs underground in some form whether it be telecoms, water, gas or electricity. All underground infrastructure is only accessible through one method \u2013 inspection chambers. These inspection chambers are common and 100s can exist within a small area. To prevent criminal damage to infrastructure and ensure safety, all of these chambers are covered with access covers. There have been no major innovations of access covers in recent times and most remain completely unsecure and vulnerable. Requests to increase security has resulted in simple measures taken in the form of padlocks and key-locks, which still leave significant vulnerabilities. Alongside these vulnerabilities, covers in strategic sites need daily monitoring. This is currently done manually with physical inspections. There is a significant cost incurred for this.\n\nWe are Hugslock Systems and have developed a solution that will secure all underground infrastructure. We have created iNTelligent Access Cover Technology \u2018iNTACT\u2019 that will truly revolutionize the security of underground critical infrastructures. iNTACT is the world\u2019s first remote lockable access cover. It is secure, impenetrable and intelligent. Intelligence is embedded within the cover in the form of sensors that can offer various monitoring capabilities such as gas, heat, water sensors, Infrared CCTV, motion, bio-hazard and seismic.\n\niNTACT completely removes the need for any physical inspections, as the remote-operated locks can be remotely monitored from a central control room. We have strong market-pull from utility providers such as SITEL of the Czech Republic and organizations such the Ministry of Defence. Based on early interest we have built bottom-up 5 year forecasts to generate cumulative turnover of \u20ac28.9m to generate \u20ac15.1m PBIT. Based on total investments of \u20ac1.85m, this will achieve a ROI of 7.2:1 and payback on investment in 29.8 months.",

Abstract: Most Cultural Heritage objects housed by museums are often stored under unsuitable climate conditions. APACHE will develop a cutting edge technology to control and prevent the degradation of such patrimony. The novel approach is based on three pillars: 1) advanced sensing and absorbing materials to control the artifacts\u2019 environment; 2) modeling to define the threshold of artifacts\u2019 degradation and to discriminate between the need for preventive or remedial conservation; 3) remote control of the works of art stressors. The unique combination of these pillars will reduce to the lowest possible level the costs actually required by conventional technology for art conservation. New generation of active and intelligent display cases, crates, and storage boxes, will be implemented thanks to: i) The unique APACHE partnership, comprising the most important experts in the three aforementioned pillars; ii) The development of easy-to-use sensing devices able to communicate through Wireless Sensor Networks and Radio Frequency Identification Devices thanks to Industry 4.0-5.0 ICT technologies, granting the optimal environmental conditions around the art objects. Multiscale models integrated in an open simulation environment will be used to predict the degradation of artefacts and set the properties of sensors (detection limits) and polyfunctional absorbents. APACHE includes small, medium, and large museums exhibiting representative variety of display and storage conditions. For instance, the Venice Peggy Guggenheim Collection features one of the most important collections of modern/contemporary art, which experiences highly unfavorable environmental conditions, difficult to control with conventional tools. Centre Pompidou and National Museum of Hungary possess a vast amount of artefacts stored in deposits (e.g. in crates and boxes). Moreover, a decision-making tool composed by a modular set of decision trees will be offered to end-users to guide them through the best solutions.",

In many applications however, fibres are now being operated very close to fundamental physical limits of the glass that forms their core, and this is already providing hard limits, for example, to the maximum data capacity or optical intensity that can be transmitted through them. A transformative new technological step is required to help increasing the information capacity and power delivery capability of optical fibres to keep up with the 1.5dB/year growth in global data traffic and with the 2dB/year raise in laser output power. Air guiding hollow core fibres can provide a natural solution, but the state of the art technology suffers from conceptual physical limitations that bound their minimum loss, maximum information capacity, and transmitted optical power and energy. This proposal addresses these global challenges by developing the \u2018ultimate\u2019 hollow core optical fibre technology based on nested antiresonant nodeless fibres. Based on a recent discovery of the PI yet to find experimental demonstration, these fibres exploit antiresonances and multiple coherent reflections from the glass membranes to achieve, unlike any other known air-guiding optical waveguide, simultaneous minimisation of surface scattering and leakage loss. By targeting a 10 times increase in data capacity and power handling and a 5 times reduction in transmission loss as compared to state-of-the-art technology, all in an ultra-low nonlinearity fibre with excellent modal purity and spectral transparency, the outcomes of this project have the potential to revolutionise telecommunications 45 years after the development of ultra-low loss glass optical fibres and to produce a step-change in many industrial and scientific high power laser delivery applications.",

Ice sheet model simulations demonstrate high sensitivity to their basal sliding parameterisation which is governed by basal roughness, the thermal state of the bed, and lithology (presence or absence or deformable sediments). Compiling observations of the current state of the glacier bed is therefore crucial for the accuracy of ice sheet modelling and future predictions of sea level change. Radio-echo sounding (RES) is the only existing geophysical technique that has sufficient data coverage to enable ice-sheet-wide information to be obtained from the bed. In general, however, quantitative analysis of radar sounding data, and integration with electromagnetic and geostatistical approaches, lags significantly behind the data availability.\n         In this fellowship I will develop an integrated framework for characterising the roughness of glacier beds; exploiting information from the electromagnetic scattering of the radar pulse and the statistics of the basal topography. This approach will enable an unprecedented characterisation of the scale dependence of basal roughness from the kilometre to the metre scale - the scale that is most relevant for basal sliding.  Via a synthesis with ice sheet models I will challenge assumptions that are made regarding basal roughness and its relationship with other geophysical data fields, enabling new radar-derived constraints to be placed upon the bed of ice sheets. Subsidiary goals include: adapting electromagnetic scattering models for fractal surfaces to ice penetrating radar; identifying and mapping regions of deformable bed; and developing a framework for combining electromagnetic scattering information from different radar systems. This fellowship represents a unique opportunity to transfer knowledge and techniques from the US geophysical radar community to European glaciology.",

The engineering of large scale heterogeneous networks that are guaranteed to be robust and scalable. \n\nII. The reverse engineering of biological networks.\n\nA distinctive feature of the networks we would like to engineer, which falls outside more traditional domains in systems and control, is that of scalability, i.e. the ability to guarantee robust stability for an arbitrary interconnection by conditions on only local interactions. The methodologies that will be developed will have a significant impact in various applications where scalability is important, such as data network protocols, group coordination problems and power distribution networks, as they can lead to network designs with guaranteed robustness, thus avoiding conservative schemes with poor performance. The proposed project will also make a contribution towards the reverse engineering of biological networks at the molecular level. Life in the cell is dictated by chance; noise is ubiquitous with its sources ranging from fluctuating environments to intrinsic fluctuations due to the random births and deaths of molecules. The fact that a substantial part of the noise is intrinsic provides a major challenge in control theoretic methodologies. How can feedback be used to suppress these fluctuations, what are the associated tradeoffs and limitations, and how does nature manage to handle these so efficiently?
