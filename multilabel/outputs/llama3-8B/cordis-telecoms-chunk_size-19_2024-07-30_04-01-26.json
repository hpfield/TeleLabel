{"text":"Title: interACT - Designing cooperative interaction of automated vehicles with other road users in mixed traffic environments Abstract: There is currently a high desire by manufacturers to introduce Automated Vehicles (AVs), SAE level 3 and above, to the market. As AVs are likely to be deployed in mixed traffic, they need to interact safely and efficiently with other (non-equipped) users, including manually driven vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. Although obstacle detection by AVs is almost flawless, these vehicles cannot communicate their intentions to other road users. This limitation currently reduces their appeal and value to the user. To ensure intuitive and cooperative interaction between the AV and others, and a smooth flow of all traffic, it is essential that there is good means of communication between all actors. The main objective of interACT is to substantially improve this communication and cooperation strategy. interACT will provide an overview of current human-machine interactions in mixed traffic, and increase chances of safe deployment of AVs by developing novel software and HMI hardware components for reliable and user-centric communication between an AV with its users. interACT will: \n1) Use social-psychological models to compile a catalogue of interactions, identifying the main communication needs of road users in current and future traffic scenarios \n2) Improve software algorithms and sensor capabilities for assessing intention recognition and behaviour prediction of surrounding road users \n3) Use a Cooperation and Communication Planning Unit to integrate planning algorithms, providing synchronized and integrated communication protocols \n4) Ensure safety of road users by developing easy-to-verify software for a safety layer, and novel methods for fail-safe trajectory planning. \nPrototypes will be developed and evaluated in multi-actor simulators and two test vehicles, assessing ease-of-use, acceptance, safety and reliability. The impact of this successful communication on reduction of crashes, improvement of traffic flow and acceptance of AVs by society will be investigated.","gt":["radar","mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0.3,"mobile phones":0.4,"bluetooth":0.2,"WiFi":0.2,"data networks":0.6,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.3,"mobile radio":0.2,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.5,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: 5GCITY - 5GCITY Abstract: Delivering on the 5G promise of increased data rates, and ubiquitous coverages, poses stringent requirements on traditional vertically integrated operators. In particular, telecom operators are expected to massively  roll out Small Cells, which requires finding appropriate urban spaces with both backhaul and energy availability. Network sharing becomes essential to unlock those commercial massive deployments. The open access model, or neutral host, will come to play a key role on the deployment of 5G networks, especially in urban scenarios where very dense Small Cell deploymens are required. \nIn parallel recent trends are paving the way towards the development of new, heterogeneous and distributed cloud paradigms that significantly differ from today\u2019s established cloud model: with edge computing, cloud architectures are pushed all the way to the edge of the network, close to the devices that produce and act on data. We posit that there are two sets of players perfectly poised to take advantage of both trends since they already own the infrastructure needed to build edge deployments: telecommunication providers and municipalities. 5GCity focuses on how common smart city infrastructure (i.e.,small cells and processing power at the very edge of networks) can bring benefit to both players based on resource sharing and end-to-end virtualization, pushing the cloud model to the extreme edge. \n5GCity will design, develop, deploy and demonstrate a distributed cloud and radio platform for municipalities and infrastructure owners acting as 5G neutral hosts. 5GCity\u2019s main aim is to build and deploy a common, multi-tenant, open platform that extends the (centralized) cloud model to the extreme edge of the network, with a demonstration in three different cities (Barcelona, Bristol and Lucca). 5GCity will directly impact a large and varied range of actors: (i) telecom providers; (ii) municipalities; and (iii) a number of different vertical sectors utilizing the city infrastructure","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0.6,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.2,"cognitive radio":0.1,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}

The groundbreaking innovation that will enable this breakthrough will be based on the realization of a so-called \u201cwide quantum well\u201d in high quality atomically thin materials in which the ultrafast formation of a charge dipole upon light absorption will lead to a fast on\/off optical modulation of the electrical signal in transistor geometries. Atomically thin materials will be engineered ad hoc by exploiting surface chemistry to heal defect and to exert a superior control over their energy band structure in order to obtain well-suited electronic, optical, and physical properties. \nThis ambitious interdisciplinary exploration will thrive on the unique synergy of the complementary expertise and skills by the applicant and host group encompassing nano-chemistry, material science, engineering and physics. Hence, this project will address a forefront research program pioneering (1) the development of a scalable solution-phase scheme for chemical engineering of defect states in atomically thin semiconductors; (2) the implementation of defect-free atomically thin semiconductors in ultrafast photodetector; and (3) the realization of atomically thin ultrafast photodetectors onto technological relevant flexible substrates.","gt":["radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0.9,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0.9,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.1,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

However, exploring such networks usually engages substantial computational resources requiring specific programing skills and dedicated facilities. In our main project NETSIGNAL, we have developed computational environment ARACHNE aiming to facilitate high-end neural network exploration among scientific and industrial users. ARACHNE enables an investigator to construct and explore cellular networks of arbitrary biophysical and architectural complexity using a simple interface on a local computer or a mobile device. Through small-file exchange via the internet, the interface controls a pre-configured computational kernel installed on a remote computer cluster or cloud. Uniquely, ARACHNE can integrate traditional wired network connections with diffuse, volume-transmitted type of inter-cellular signalling, to reflect the emerging role of glia in brain processing. ARACHNE thus affords a flexible neural network design and incorporates latest advances in neuroscience while providing a portable console suitable for IT-untrained explorers. ARACHNE has passed a feasibility and novelty test by independent experts (Aleksin et al, PLoS Comp Biology 2017, in press), its test version is available on-line (https:\/\/github.com\/LeonidSavtchenko\/Arachne\/).

{"text":"Title: WABCom - Water-to-Air Backscatter Communications Abstract: Over 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered by water, while the majority of the underwater areas are unexplored yet. Owing to growing underwater activities, e.g., undersea oil & gas exploration, and Internet of underwater things, reliable water-to-air wireless communications are urgently needed by the industry, military, and scientific communities. As it is difficult to use a single type of signal, e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), or optical, for communication across a water-air interface, most existing water-to-air communications rely on sonobuoys to relay acoustic signals from underwater transmitters to RF receivers on\/above the water surface. The global sonobuoy market is predicted to reach $595.9 million at a 6.62% CAGR over the period 2018-2023. Since sonobuoys might not be recovered from remote, hostile areas of the ocean, battery-powered sonobuoys (which have battery packs full of toxic metals) are posing a great threat to the marine environment. Although energy-harvesting technologies (e.g., photovoltaic, wave action, or seawater based semi-fuel cell) have been developed for sonobuoys to charge onboard energy storage systems, the challenge of miniaturizing and incorporating these technologies into the sonobuoy volume constraint remains a dominant issue. \nThis project will develop novel water-to-air backscatter communication (WABCom) technology to enable the design of lightweight, battery-free sonobuoys by leveraging RF backscatter communications, where the RF energy harvested by the sonobuoy from an unmanned aerial vehicle\u2019s (UAV) transmission is used to support the circuit operation at the sonobuoy, and the sonobuoy forwards the received underwater signal to the UAV via an RF backscatter link (i.e., by modulating the signal on the RF waveform reflected back to the UAV).

{"text":"Title: INSTINCT - Inhibiting Stress in the Construction Industry Abstract: Work-related stress is costing the UK economy about 10 million man-hours and \u20ac16 billion. An intervention to curb the advent of stress is proposed: \u2018Stress-Blocker\u2019 (Streblo). Cognitive psychology identifies five main personalities (Big-5): extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness. How these Big-5 differ in the dynamics of stress are unexplored, particularly in the field of construction where stress is also prevalent. Behavioural science explains differences in the coping abilities of people. Thus Part A of the study is an empirical investigation of the impacts of stressors on the Big-5 and their different coping behaviours. Data from at least 1500 UK construction personnel will be collected using a questionnaire, and analysed using multiple inferential statistical techniques: hierarchical regression, factor analysis and sequential equation modelling. The findings will then inform Part B: the development of Streblo, a cloud-based IT tool for the effective recognition and deterrence of stress. Streblo will operate on artificial intelligence and its initial simulation will be carried out using of the WEKA software. Data from 1200 respondents will be used to train Streblo while the remaining 300 pseudo responses will be used to pilot (validate) the performance of the product. Streblo will also be validated with the partner organisations and project managers, through focus group meetings which will be recorded, transcribed and analysed using the \u2018Nvivo\u2019 software. Streblo will then be launched as a simple, quick-to-use and free IT app which will be accessible on mobile devices, PCs and laptops. Streblo will exploit advanced technologies to prevent stress in different construction job profiles as well as other sectors of the economy. It will be the first worldwide integrated system that is based on personality profiling and associated coping skills to empower individuals to manage event-related stress in the context of their job roles.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Inaccuracies are difficult to spot and information given to stakeholders about the trajectory is limited, arriving late, and full of inconsistencies and wrong assumptions. Military Flights are currently not integrated in the ATM-system, so demanding special treatment.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lack of complete, updated, unique and coherent aeronautical and meteorological information at European level, which again limits the accuracy of the predicted trajectory and so difficult detecting incoming issues and designing optimum solutions.\n\nThis project addresses solutions for the above limitations. Harmonized and global trajectory information sharing, including improved negotiation mechanisms, will enable significant operational benefits on flight management.

{"text":"Title: COHERENT - Coordinated control and spectrum management for 5G heterogeneous radio access networks Abstract: The exponential growth of mobile traffic, drastically increasing of network complexity, and the strong need for inter-network coordination of wireless network resources call for breakthroughs in control, coordination and flexible spectrum management  in 5G heterogeneous radio access networks. The COHERENT project aims to address these problems by researching, developing and validating a novel control framework for future mobile networks. The key innovation of COHERENT is to develop a unified programmable control framework to coordinate the underlying heterogeneous mobile networks as a whole. The COHERENT control framework has two unique features to deal with the insufficiency of current control solutions for inter-network coordination. First, theories and methods to abstract the low layer network states and behaviors of different underlying mobile networks are developed, which provides a simplified but sufficient abstracted network view for network-wide control and resource coordination. Network abstraction will significantly reduce the signaling overhead, making scalable network-wide control solutions feasible, and enable more flexible spectrum management, which are key for the success of 5G networks. Second, based on the abstracted network view, common interfaces and software-development kits will be developed to enable programmability in controlling and coordinating heterogeneous mobile networks. The programmable control will provide operators a flexible and cost efficient way to implement new control functions and thus to support new services. The innovative impact of the COHERENT project is in enabling a unified control and coordination framework for heterogeneous mobile networks by combining innovative approaches on abstraction of low layers in underlying mobile networks, software defined networking, and flexible spectrum management.

If even one of the parts fails the controls won\u2019t work and car models could be recalled by the factory to have to fix the issue. The assembled components are difficult to take apart and need to go through a timely, costly process to be recycled and not be turned into e-waste. The main problem behind in-car controls are that they cause significant distractions to drivers which has been found the cause of 80% of road traffic accidents. The problem is only becoming worse with infotainment displays imbedded with multiple lights and sensors and controls being inputted through a large touch-screen device.\nTangi0 have developed a new method for operating controls in the cockpit of cars through an intuitive, tactile material with distinctive shapes that allow drivers to operate it eye-free.

{"text":"Title: LPGPU2 - Low-Power Parallel Computing on GPUs 2 Abstract: Low-power GPUs have become ubiquitous, they can be found in domains ranging from wearable and mobile computing, to automotive systems. With this ubiquity has come a wider range of applications exploiting low-power GPUs, placing ever increasing demands on the expected performance and power efficiency of the devices.  Future low-power system-on-chips will have to provide higher performance and be able to support more complex applications, without using any additional power.\n\nThe strict power limitations means that these demands cannot be met through hardware improvements alone, however, but the software must better exploit the available resources.  Unfortunately, programmers are hindered when creating low-power GPU software by the quality of current performance analysis tools.  In low-power GPU contexts there is only a minimal amount of performance information, and essentially no power information, available to the programmer.  As software becomes more complex it becomes increasingly unmanageable for programmers to optimise the software for low-power devices.\n\nThis project proposes to aid the programmer in creating software for low-power GPUs by building on the results of the first LPGPU project to provide a complete performance analysis process for the programmer.  This project will address all aspects of performance analysis, from hardware power and performance counters, to a toolchain that processes and visualises information from these counters, to applications that will be used as use-cases to drive the entire design.

{"text":"Title: ComRad - Combining MIMO Radar with MU-MIMO Communications: More than Coexistence (ComRad) Abstract: Frequency spectrum has nowadays become one of the most valuable assets, as the wireless communications devices and services are growing explosively. Realising the scarcity of the spectrum, future wireless systems are exploring the feasibility to use the spectrum that is currently occupied by radar systems, such as 3.4GHz and 5.6GHz bands used by airborne and shipborne radars. With the allocation of available spectrum to newer communication technologies, the interference in radar bands is on the rise consequently. Therefore, effective interference management approaches are needed for achieving the spectral coexistence between the current radar and communication services. More fundamentally, dual-functional systems that can simultaneously perform remote sensing and transmit useful information via classical communications could be an essential solution in the future, which not only ensures the spectral coexistence but also the improvement for both radar and communication\u2019s performance. The goal of ComRad is to develop novel signal processing techniques for transmit and receive beamforming, waveform design, signal classification\/recognition, and channel estimation, to enable the exploitation of radar spectrum for communication applications, with particular focus on 1) coexisting communication and radar systems (C-ComRad), and 2) Dual-functional Communication-Radar Systems (D-ComRad). The main research approaches that will be employed include the cutting-age concepts of interference exploitation, manifold based optimization and machine learning. The research outputs will have a significant impact on the applicant\u2019s career prospects enabling him to obtain a leadership position in academia or industry. More importantly, it will also contribute to the efficient usage of the spectrum, which is closely related to the economic future of the European Union (EU), especially the digital communication for essential public services such as defense, police and emergency services.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0.9,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0.6,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.1,"cognitive radio":0.9,"fixed wireless network":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0.1}}

{"text":"Title: TUNEMODE - TUNABLE MODE RANDOM FIBER LASER FOR MODE DIVISION MULTIPLEXING LASER SOURCE Abstract: The evolution of the bandwidth demand in optical fiber communication system in the Europe region keeps increasing year after year. As for now, most of these demands are supported by the WDM system of optical communication network. It is forecasted that this increasing bandwidth demand could not be supported any more data traffics in the future due to the consumption growth of new applications. In this regards, a new system for solving this issue is becoming all the necessary. An alternative which is forecasted to be able to fulfill this demand is Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM). MDM basically is based on a concept developed for increasing the optical data transmission capacity within the optical fiber itself. Thus, this project will be carried out to investigate the mode tuning of random fiber laser for the application in MDM system. The main objective of this project is to generate a laser with various modes which can be tuned by using few mode fiber and will be using random fiber laser. The purpose of using random fiber laser is because the conventional rare earth based fiber laser such as Erbium and Ytterbium are not optimized for lasing at higher order mode than the fundamental mode LP01. Investigation on mode tunability will be carried out using micro fiber technology and also fiber Bragg grating technology whereby the combination of these two technologies will be functioning as the tunable and filtering element. Also, in this project, new ideas and concepts will be developed whereby the generation of a laser with various modes will probably generate new concepts and findings, not only for MDM system, but also for the device to support this application in the future. In this regards, this research is very significant, in conjunction with the growth of the bandwidth demand in the Europe region as well as in the world.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"telecommunications":0.9,"optical networks":0.8,"data networks":0.7,"radio technology":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0.9,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

To tackle this problem, we propose to generate compositions based on structural templates at varying hierarchical levels. Our novel approach deploys machine-learning methods in an optimization context to morph existing pieces into new ones and to fuse different styles.\n\nWe aim to develop a framework that combines machine learning techniques that learn style, with a powerful optimization method, the variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm, for generating music. This approach allows the learned model to incorporate a wide variety of constraints, including those for preserving long term coherence and structure. It promises to effect a step-change in automatic music generation by moving the field in the new direction of generating structured music using hybrid machine learning-optimization techniques.\n\nThe applicant is an operations researcher-musician, ideal for this work. A first step combines her VNS music generation algorithm with machine learning methods to ensure proper style evaluation. In previous work, the applicant has shown that VNS outperforms genetic algorithms when generating counterpoint with a rule-based objective function. In a preliminary study, the applicant has demonstrated the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques as evaluation metrics for optimisation methods. The applicant has extensive web development experience; to reach the widest possible audience, the resulting system will be made available in an interactive website where users can morph and fuse musical pieces.\nThis work is situated in the area of digital media, with a European consumer expenditure of over \u20ac33 billion in 2011, projected to increase.

In 5G-CARMEN important European industries, academics and innovative SMEs commit to achieve world-wide impact by conducting extensive trials across an important corridor (by people\/goods traffic volumes), from Bologna to Munich, spanning 600 km of roads, connecting three European regions (Bavaria, Tirol and Trentino\/South-Tyrol) across three countries. Vehicle manoeuvre negotiation (at various levels of automation), infotainment, and emission control in sensitive areas are the cross-border use cases targeted by 5G-CARMEN pilots in order to maximise the project commercial, societal, end environmental impact.\nThe project will build a 5G-enabled corridor to conduct cross-border trials and will deploy a mixture of 5G micro- and macro-cells for ubiquitous C-V2X connectivity. The 5G New Radio will be used to support latency sensitive and\/or bandwidth hungry services and applications. The project will leverage on a distributed mobile edge cloud spanning from the vehicle itself to the centralised cloud. Multi-tenancy and neutral host concepts will be leveraged upon to deliver a final platform capable of enabling new business models. 5G-CARMEN will complement C-V2X with LTE and C-ITS technologies, targeting interoperability and harnessing a hybrid network.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":1,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: SmarterEMC2 - Smarter Grid: Empowering SG Market Actors through Information and Communication Technologies Abstract: Power systems undergo massive technological changes due to the ever increasing concerns for environmental and energy sustainability. The increase of RES and DG penetration is one of the main goals in Europe in order to meet the environmental targets. However these goals will require new business cases and must be based on innovative ICT tools and communication infrastructure. On parallel, following the M\/490 EU Mandate, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI proposed a technical report describing the Smart Grid Reference Architecture and the Smart Grids Architecture Model (SGAM) framework. A key objective of new Research and Innovation projects should be to provide solutions and ICT tools compatible with the SGAM and the standardization activity in Europe. Such new projects should also support the standardization activity by proposing additions or changes related to their objectives. Another key issue to address is whether the existing telecommunication infrastructure is sufficient to support in mass scale the new business cases and Smart Grid services. SmarterEMC2 implements ICT tools that support Customer Side Participation and RES integration, and facilitate open access in the electricity market. These tools take into account the SGAM as well the future structure of the Distribution Network as described by the relevant EU bodies and organizations. The project supports standardization activity by proposing adaptation to data models of market-oriented standards (IEC 62325-351) and field level standards (IEC 61850). Moreover, the project is fully dedicated towards achieving a maximum of impact. To validate the proposed technologies, the project includes 3 real-world pilots and large-scale simulation in 3 laboratories. The former will demonstrate the impact of Demand Response and Virtual Power Plants services in the real world settings, while the latter will reveal the ability of the communication networks to support massive uptake of such services.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.2,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: UMOBILE - Universal, mobile-centric and opportunistic communications architecture Abstract: Cars, sensors, home appliances, every device in the daily life of citizens is becoming a constituent in Future Internet, adding to the need to reconsider requirements and assumptions in terms of network availability and affordability to support the ever increasing traffic demand. Still, the current Internet can only evolve adequately, if its infrastructure can be devised to accommodate the emerging services. The increased cost of adding new infrastructure and capacity has a drastic effect on rural and remote communities as well as nomadic users as they become marginalized by not gaining access to crucial Internet services. Our goal is to make the Future Internet universally pervasive supporting a diverse set of services. To achieve this, we develop a universal mobile-centric and opportunistic communications architecture, which integrates the principles of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking (ICN) in a common framework. We utilize the benefits of both ICN and DTN to enable resource exploitation at minimal bandwidth, opportunistic access to information and more localized access to information through novel caching strategies. UMOBILE focuses on assisting users in getting access to the content they want or content that may be of shared interest to their trust circles. By relying on an instance of the UMOBILE architecture, users are able to share information directly with other peers without relying on infrastructure or expensive connectivity services. The proposed architecture targets the mobile part of the networks, extends Internet connectivity to regions that are not typically covered enhancing network resilience and is fully backward compatible with the current Internet architecture. We will validate our architecture in a real world trial as well as participate strategically in carefully planned dissemination, standardization and exploitation activities to ensure that our architecture transcends from the lab to real world deployments.","gt":["data networks","mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.7,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.5,"WiFi":0.8,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.6,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.9,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0.7,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0.6,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

Specifically, I propose to produce a step change in the photonics field through the employment of the Dynamic Templating Process (DTP), an elegant, fully solution-processing method, which exploits the self-assembly of water microdroplets, to create micro-honeycombs, i.e. 2D photonic crystals. As solution-processable material, I propose to use an organic:inorganic hybrid, which shows refractive indexes above 2. Then, I aim to create novel 2D hierarchical and 3D photonic structures based on thy hybrid honeycombs for optical field management. In the last stage I will transform the DTP into an industrially scalable process for photonic crystal and device manufacturing. Thereby, I propose an ambitious, multidisciplinary and self-consistent project, which encompasses the synthesis of novel materials, the development of microprocessing methods, the production and characterisation of a new class of photonic elements, and the development of industrial production processes.

{"text":"Title: HarvestAll - Development of multi-source micro energy harvesting power management devices Abstract: Many IoT market leaders incl. ARM Holdings (the world's leading semiconductor IP supplier) predict that the IoT will begin to free itself from battery power in 2018.  Without reducing the reliance on battery power, there is a significant roadblock in reaching trillions of devices. Future devices will need to be self-sufficient and operate without any battery swaps or any human intervention for decades. This will be made possible through harvesting of all the available ambient energy in the environment, for example:\nThermal energy associated with static and dynamic temperature differences;\nVibration energy e.g. from vehicles driving over a bridge or oil following through a pipe;\nLight energy from indoor artificial lighting. \nFor these predictions to be realised, the current roadblock is micro energy harvesting systems that can effectively capture all available energy using just one energy management device. The technical challenge is that these ambient energy sources have widely different electrical characteristics that must be managed e.g: photovoltaic and thermoelectric harvesters are low-voltage DC, resistive, \u201ctrickle\u201d sources; electrodynamic harvesters are high-voltage, inductive, \u201cpulsed\u201d sources whilst piezoelectric harvesters are high-voltage AC, capacitive, \u201cbursty\u201d sources.\nTrameto is a UK-based fabless semiconductor business that is focusing on bringing \u2018HarvestAll\u2019 to market.

{"text":"Title: NCLas - NanoCrystals in Fibre Lasers Abstract: The NCLas project will introduce and develop a disruptive technology for the synthesis of glasses containing functional nanocrystals (NCs). It is based on a novel hybrid nanosintering process, which allows for the incorporation of a large variety of NCs and functionalization of glasses in different formats for various applications. Previous attempts to either grow NCs inside glass by a glass heat treatment or incorporate NCs during glass formation showed unconvincing results. In our nanosintering process, key enabling steps include reducing the sintering temperature, developing specialized NC core-shell structures and adjusting the glass composition, thus achieving a chemically inert environment and matching the refractive index of NCs and glass. This technology will be exploited to produce low-loss, NC-functionalized glass fibres. Fibre lasers are energy efficient and compact and offer maintenance-free operation, ultra-short pulses, high power, and low noise. Today\u2019s commercial fibre lasers are fabricated from robust, durable silica glass. The operation of oxide fibre lasers can be extended to an enormous spectral range (~400\u20133000 nm) by doping oxide glasses with laser-active nanocrystals optimized for particular laser wavelengths, thus enabling a huge variety of new applications. We will demonstrate two highly relevant fibre lasers: (i) a Ti3+:sapphire-NC fibre laser tuneable around 800 nm for bio-photonic applications; (ii) a Pr3+:yttria-NC 1300-nm fibre laser enabling a much-awaited wavelength extension in telecommunications and also fitting into one of the biophotonic windows.

Abstract: This European Training Network aims to produce the next generation of early stage researchers who will enable Europe to take a leading role in the development of future devices, systems and networks supporting the 5G high-speed wireless internet. To do this, researchers must be able to work in interdisciplinary teams, integrate their activities, share expertise, and promote a vision of a converged wireless and optical devices and networks that efficiently supports the services and applications being demanded. A large number of technologies and devices will need to converge, co-exist and interoperate, and most importantly, cooperate, if this vision is to be efficiently and cost-effectively realised. A key area within this next generation jigsaw is the integration of optical fibre networks and radio networks at mm-wave frequencies, to provide high-bandwidth front\/backhaul services and enable scalable and manageable networks without a highly complex interface structure and multiple overlaid protocols.\n\nFIWIN5G aims to provide doctoral students with the exposure to the range of skills, necessary to address these challenging demands. Deep technical knowledge but also key transferable skills common in entrepreneurship, management, financing as well as communication, and societal outreach. While becoming expects in one particular sub-domain, they must understand the broad context of their work, whether it is systems\/network engineers understanding the devices and technologies that make up the networks or device engineers understanding the networks in which their devices will function.\n\nWe draw together a range of world-leading partners, selected for their complimentary and excellence to offer a vital opportunity to advance industry\u2019s understanding and uptake of the key technologies in this area. To provide excellent training and diverse experience of research environments, all project involve a significant period of secondment and collaboration with an industry partner.","gt":["5G","radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0.8,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0.9,"microwave technology":0.8,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.6,"LiFi":0.8,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.9,"cognitive radio":0.1,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}
{"text":"Title: VRACE - VRACE - Virtual Reality Audio for Cyber Environments Abstract: \u201eVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have the potential to become the next big computing platform, and as we saw with the PC and Smartphone, we expect new markets to be created and existing markets to be disrupted.\u201c (Understanding the Race for the Next Computing Platform, Goldman Sachs 2016). While its technology is still considered in the early stages of development, it is already mature in the video game area.\nVR\/AR has the potential to change the way we do business, social interactions or education, but its applicability beyond gaming requires further development. An important field of research is the audio part. The importance of sound becomes evident when considering how people orientate themselves in space. Unlike seeing, hearing allows us to perceive instantly from all angles, and plays a leading role in giving us clues where to look at. To support natural orientation in VR\/AR, the visual and auditory information has to closely match, as otherwise the illusion is shattered and the experience is not convincing.\nVRACE aims at providing physically correct and perceptually convincing soundscapes in VR. This goal is pursued through dedicated training of ESRs in all VR-related domains, namely physical modelling, sound propagation, audio rendering and psychoacoustics. Specific research projects involve modelling of sound sources, such as musical instruments, voices, vehicles, colliding objects or environmental sound sources, studying sound propagation in complex interior spaces like concert halls and in outdoor environments such as urban or rural areas and investigating human perception and localisation of sounds.\nWith an estimated revenue of $80bn by 2025 (G&S) the demand for trained VR audio experts will increase rapidly. Besides advancing methodologies in this cutting-edge technology, VRACE will train 15 ESRs who will multiply and spread this knowledge in industry and academia. VRACE thus gives European industry a competitive edge in this global race.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: VESAFE - Enhanced 5G Vehicle to Vehicle Technologies for Safe and Reliable Connected Autonomous Vehicles Applications Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) holds great potentials for road safety and efficiency, but two major barriers need to be removed before its potentials can be fully unleashed: significantly enhanced vehicle to vehicle (eV2V) services with millimetre wave (mmWave) communications and reliable cooperative perception with autonomous vehicles (AV) sensors. However, the directional connectivity of mmWave presents new challenges for the whole protocol stack of V2V networks, while reliable cooperative perception requires novel design of deep learning (DL) models for object detection and fusion of sensor data from neighbour AVs. The above challenges underpinned by CAV demand a holistic design and tight integration of connected vehicles (CV) and AV technologies. \nThis innovative and multi-disciplinary project VESAFE will train the outstanding Fellow candidate to tackle the key challenges with complementary expertise and realize the full potentials of CAV. A novel cross-layer design is proposed for the research of 5th generation (5G) eV2V schemes with mmWave and reliable cooperative perception for advanced CAV safety applications: the eV2V schemes are AV oriented and greatly assisted by the AV cooperative perception, and the reliable cooperative perception is boosted by the awareness of V2V network conditions. And this project propose a novel integrated evaluation of 5G eV2V and CAV applications to support system design and performance characterization. Through the cutting-edge research, this innovative project will produce robust eV2V schemes and reliable cooperative perception solutions, make breakthrough on 5G V2V and CAV safety applications. It will significantly improve the Fellow\u2019s employability and career prospects, strengthen knowledge transfer, boosting the research and innovation (R&I) capacity and research quality, therefore contributing to Europe\u2019s competitiveness and growth in critical sectors of 5G\/6G and AV.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.6,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: ORACLE - ORigin determination and improved detectAbility of Celestial-to-Local phEnomena by the VLF technique Abstract: The lower ionosphere (70\u201390 km), a ionized region in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, can be understood as a membrane acting as a sensor to different kinds of phenomena originating at Earth (e.g., lightning) or in space (e.g., space weather). Unexpected strong changes in this region can influence dramatically the performance and reliability of navigation and communication. However, the impact of those phenomena in this region is difficult to quantify accurately. On one hand, this region is too high for balloons and on the other hand it is too low for satellites. In this project, Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio waves will be used because they propagate between the Earth surface and the ionosphere with low attenuation. The researcher will push forward novel scientific understanding of the properties of the lower ionosphere and magnetosphere. She will: (1) determine whether the day-to-day variability of the VLF signal during sunrise can be explained by the ozone variability at its upper boundary, (2) find the yet unknown generation mechanism of VLF banded emissions, and (3) improve the detectability of galactic gamma-ray bursts, known as the most energetic phenomena in the universe. The project is strongly multidisciplinary, involving perspectives and concepts from astrophysics, magnetospheric, ionospheric, atmospheric physics and big data handling. This will be developed by the researcher within the frame of interaction and cooperation with the host and secondments. The results of this proposal have the potential to convey new perspectives in ionospheric and magnetospheric studies and provide some answers to long standing issues within the field of space weather, which has become of central importance in many aspects of human life and industry.

The total economic cost of premature deaths in the WHO European Region has been estimated at \u20ac1.47 trillion each year. Emissions from petrol and particularly diesel vehicles (esp. \u2018PM2.5\u2019) are a major contributor to this crisis.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are well suited for modern Smart City environments; they produce zero emissions at point of use and less noise pollution compared with gasoline-powered vehicles. However, the growth of charging infrastructure has not kept momentum with vehicle development, limiting the widespread uptake of EVs. The currently available unreliable, slowcharging infrastructure is ineffective, making longer journeys uncertain, causing \u2018range anxiety\u2019. Slow chargers take 9 hours or more to charge a car, but upgrading slow chargers to rapid charging posts (involving inflexible sub-station upgrades and associated disruption over a long period) is impractical and costly for local authorities.

{"text":"Title: CAMELOT - C2 Advanced Multi-domain Environment and Live Observation Technologies Abstract: The creation of the Schengen area has been one of the major achievements of the EU. However, this agreement requires countries to cooperate tightly in order to keep a high level of security at their internal borders, as well as to share the responsibility of managing external borders. Such a variety of borders (land, sea and air) and current challenges requires a consistent approach to border surveillance, based on a plethora of heterogeneous assets. These can be manned or unmanned, ranging from sensors (optical, radar, IR) to unmanned platforms (UAV, UGV, USV or UUV), and need to be combined to offer an integrated situational picture of the area under surveillance and of their location. In order to effectively control their operation and manage the large amounts of data collected by them, new approaches for command and control need to be considered, allowing efficient interaction between the operator and the different assets in the field. CAMELOT proposes to develop and demonstrate different advanced command and control service modules for multiple platform domains, based on a SOA architecture that specifies internal and external interfaces, allowing the development of a modular and scalable command and control station, customisable to the user needs. This architecture can be based on results of previous studies and work or open architectures that may prove more suitable and the interfaces can take advantage of the standardisation work that has been done already. After the definition, CAMELOT partners will prototype service modules according to their expertise, background individual technologies and practitioner needs. These will be integrated progressively in specific testing along the project. This prototype development approach will culminate in 2 final demonstrations involving end users and relevant stakeholders, to achieve a maturity of TRL6 (for most individual technologies supporting the functionalities for border surveillance) and an IRL of 7 for CAMELOT.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.7,"radar":0.9,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0.7,"microwave technology":0.6,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0.6,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0.5,"satellite radio":0.4,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.5,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: PROTECTIVE - Proactive Risk Management  through Improved Cyber Situational Awareness Abstract: PROTECTIVE is designed to improve an organisations ongoing awareness of the risk posed to its business by cyber security attacks. PROTECTIVE makes two key contributions to achieve this enhanced situational awareness. Firstly it increases the computer security incident response team\u2019s (CSIRT) threat awareness through improved security monitoring and increased sharing of threat intelligence between organisations within a community. Secondly it ranks critical alerts based on the potential damage the attack can inflict on the threatened assets and hence to the organisations business. High impact alerts that target important hosts will have a higher priority than other alerts. Through the combination of these two measures organisations are better prepared to handle incoming attacks, malware outbreaks and other security problems and to guide the development of the prevention and remediation processes.\nThe PROTECTIVE system is designed to provide solutions for public domain CSIRTs and SME\u2019s who both have needs outside the mainstream of cyber security solution provision. Public CSIRTs needs arise in part because commercial tools do not address their unique requirements. This has created a shortfall, clearly articulated by ENISA, of tools with the required analytical and visualisation capabilities to enable public CSIRTs provide optimised services to their constituency. SME\u2019s also are vulnerable to cybercrime as they have limited resources to protect themselves and often a limited understanding of what needs to be done. Two pilots will be conducted to evaluate and validate the PROTECTIVE outcomes with CSIRTs from 3 National Research and Educational Networks (NRENs) and with SMEs via a managed security service provider (MSSP). \nThe PROTECTIVE consortium is constituted of 3 NRENs, 3 academic and four commercial partners from 8 countries so as to maximise the technical and commercial impact of the outputs and the dissemination and uptake of the results.","gt":["telecommunications networks"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: SINHOPSI - Single-Hole Pumping in Silicon Abstract: A globally consistent system of measurement units and reference standards is a necessary underpinning feature of most technological, industrial and economic activities. In fact, to perform measurements of physical quantities, record and compare them in a consistent way, systems of units and standards have been historically developed and agreed upon. However, in the last few decades, the ever-increasing need for stability and reliability has determined a shift from standards based on material artefacts or prototypes towards those based on physical phenomena and true constants of nature. The focus of this proposal is the development of a novel quantum technology to generate highly accurate electric currents directly linked to the elementary charge. This could serve as the practical implementation for a quantum-based standard for the SI unit ampere, which is a long-standing goal in electrical metrology. Semiconductor nano-scale charge pumps have been used in the last three decades to generate accurate electric currents by clocking the transport of single electrons with driving oscillators. The main limitation to the fidelity of the charge transfer is ultimately ascribable to the poor spatial confinement of electrons that produces errors during the pumping cycle. In this project silicon-based nanotechnology will be employed to realize and operate the world-first charge pump based on the transfer of single holes rather than electrons. A hole carries the positive equivalent of an elementary charge, but its effective mass can be significantly larger than the electron's. The resulting tightly confined charge carrier wavefunction is expected to provide significant benefits in suppressing pumping errors. The primary objectives will be to develop the underpinning technology to fabricate and operate the first single-hole pump, and experimentally assess its performances in comparison to the well-established electron-based technology.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: NARRATIVENSCIENCE - Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives Abstract: The aim of this project is to understand the role of narrative in modern science. Narratives have appeared in many places in the human, social and natural sciences over the past two centuries. They can be found both in accounts of real situations and in simulations of virtual situations, in empirical work and in theorizing. It is clear that narratives have played important roles for scientists well beyond the simple act of reporting. Yet we lack an account of what kinds of thing scientists know from using narrative and how such \u2018narrative knowing\u2019 is constituted. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of medicine and evolutionary biology, even the study of those field narratives, as narratives, has been largely ignored by both historians of science and narrative scholars.\nWhat do scientists gain from using narratives, what functions do narratives play? Initial research shows that scientists have used narratives to figure out what fits together with what, and to create coherence amongst the elements in their research.  But the means of such ordering vary - from site to site, and from science to science. Narratives used to explore a path dependent system in nineteenth century biology used a different mode of ordering both from the configuring narratives of mid-twentieth century case studies in sociology, and from the \u2018how possibly\u2019 narratives of modern computer-based simulations. Such variety requires a broad project, using many case studies to explore the critical role that scientists\u2019 narratives have played in modern science. Making sense of such variety offers an ambitious challenge. But while there is surely no simple answer to why scientists use narratives, all these notions of narrative ordering do have something in common. They suggest that narratives function not just to describe and report as one might expect, they play a much more important role in answering scientists\u2019s own questions and so - in various ways - in providing scientific explanations.","gt":["teleology"],"preds":{"teleology":0.9,"telecommunications":0.1,"radio frequency":0.1,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"data networks":0.1,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.1,"mobile radio":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.1,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Such species have evolved to display recognition units on their surfaces which may interact with considerable affinity with glycan structures displayed on cellular surfaces. This molecular recognition constitutes a key step in the processes of infection or toxicity, and is therefore an attractive target for the development of diagnostic devices. In this project, Dr Clare Mahon proposes to develop surface-tethered polymer brushes which will mimic the glycocalyx in terms of facilitating adhesion of pathogens. Through the incorporation of different fluorophores, the surfaces will be used to construct sensing arrays which will enable the rapid and cost-effective identification of water-borne pathogens and common respiratory pathogens.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: ELVER - Engineering with Logic and Verification: Mathematically Rigorous Engineering for Safe and Secure Computer Systems Abstract: Computer systems have become critical to modern society, but they are pervasively subject to security flaws and malicious attacks, with large-scale exposures of confidential data, denial-of-service and ransom attacks, and the threat of nation-state attackers: they are trusted, but are far from trustworthy. This is especially important for the major pan-industry components of our information infrastructure: processors, programming languages, operating systems, etc.\n\nThe basic problem is that conventional engineering techniques suffice only to make systems that *usually* work. The usual test-and-debug development methods, with poorly specified abstractions described in prose, lack the mathematical rigour of other engineering disciplines - yet the huge investment in legacy systems and skills makes it hard to improve.\n\nELVER will develop *mathematically rigorous* methods for specifying, testing, and reasoning about *real systems*, focussed on the core mechanisms used by hardware and software to enforce security boundaries.  It will establish mathematical models for the industry ARM architecture, used pervasively in mobile phones and embedded devices, and the CHERI research architecture, which protects against many attacks. Using these, ELVER will build tools for analysis of system software, develop techniques for mathematical proof of safety and security properties, and explore improved systems programming languages.  ELVER will build on successful collaborations with ARM, IBM, and the C\/C++ ISO standards committees.  It will directly impact mainstream processor architectures, languages, and development methods, smoothly complementing existing methods while simultaneously enabling longer-term research towards the gold standard of provably secure systems.\n\nELVER will thus demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a more rigorous approach to system engineering, putting future systems on more solid foundations, and hence making them safer and more secure","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0.9,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

Through an experienced interdisciplinary consortium, MAZI delivers a DIY networking toolkit that offers tools and guidelines for the easy deployment and customization of local networks and services. MAZI toolkit is designed to take advantage of particular characteristics of DIY networking: the de facto physical proximity between those connected; the increased privacy and autonomy; and the inclusive access. Such characteristics are used to promote information exchanges that can develop the location-based collective awareness, as a basis for fostering social cohesion, conviviality, knowledge sharing, and sustainable living. To achieve this objective, MAZI brings together partners from different disciplines: computer networks, urban planning and interdisciplinary studies, human-computer interaction, community informatics, and design research. These academic partners will collaborate closely with four community partners to ensure that MAZI toolkit benefits from the grounded experience of citizen engagement. MAZI draws from the diverse mix of competencies of its consortium to develop a transdisciplinary research framework, which will guide a series of long-term pilot studies in a range of environments, and enhanced by cross-fertilization events.

{"text":"Title: MolCellTissMech - Molecular and cellular determinants of cell monolayer mechanics Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are amongst the simplest tissues in the body, yet they play fundamental roles in adult organisms where they separate the internal environment from the external environment and in development when the intrinsic forces generated by cells within the monolayer drive tissue morphogenesis. The mechanics of these simple tissues is dictated by the cytoskeletal and adhesive proteins that interface the constituent cells into a tissue-scale mechanical syncitium. Mutations in these proteins lead to diseases with fragilised epithelia. However, a quantitative understanding of how subcellular structures govern monolayer mechanics, how cells sense their mechanical environment and what mechanical forces participate in tissue morphogenesis is lacking.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, my lab devised a new technique to study the mechanics of load-bearing monolayers under well-controlled mechanical conditions while allowing imaging at subcellular, cellular and tissue resolutions. Using this instrument, my proposal aims to understand the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics as well as the cellular behaviours that drive tissue morphogenesis.  I will focus on four objectives: 1) discover the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics, 2) characterise monolayer mechanics, 3) dissect how tension is sensed by monolayers, and 4) investigate the biophysics of individual cell behaviours participating in tissue morphogenesis.\n\nTogether these studies will enable us to understand how monolayer mechanics is affected by changes in single cell behaviour, subcellular organisation, and molecular turnover. This multi-scale characterisation of monolayer mechanics will set the stage for new theoretical descriptions of living tissues involving both molecular-scale phenomena (cytoskeletal turnover, contractility, and protein unfolding) operating on short time-scales and rearrangements due to cell-scale phenomena (cell intercalation, cell division) acting on longer times.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: Airport IQ - Situation-Aware Mobile Platform for Airport Collaborative Decision-Making Abstract: The economic costs of aircraft delays in Europe have been estimated at 1.25Bn Euros per year. Aircraft delays also result in environmental costs: aircraft holding or queuing with engines on, resulting in excess environmental emissions and air quality or noise impact, unnecessary ground movements and activation of auxiliary power units.\nAirport IQ will develop a mobile information sharing system connecting back-end A-CDM systems with mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and other wearable devices) carried by ground staff. The system will provide the right information at the right place and time to the right people, making it easier for planners to make optimal use of resources. This will help reduce primary and reactionary delays, improve the reliability of estimates, and allow airlines to make smarter decisions about turnaround buffers, that will be shorter than before.  Airport IQ will also offer a simple way to simulate turnaround activities, making it possible to run operational exercises using the same mobile tools, which will simplify and improve the quality of training, as well as providing the basis for designing longer-term improvements in ground handling processes. \nThe solution has the potential to create significant economic and environmental savings for the entire air transport value chain, as demonstrated by pilot trials  to be organized in 3 European airports (Lisboa, Heathrow and Targu Mures), involving real end-users (i.e. ground handling and other airport staff) using \u201clive\u201d onsite data.

{"text":"Title: COSMOS - Control and measurement of single macromolecules in space and time Abstract: The desire to \u201cfreely suspend the constituents of matter\u201d in order to study their behaviour can be traced back over 200 years to Lichtenberg\u2019s diaries. From radio-frequency ion traps to optical tweezing of colloidal particles, existing methods to trap matter in free space or solution rely on the use of external fields that often strongly perturb the integrity of a macromolecule in solution. Recently, I invented the \u2018electrostatic fluidic trap\u2019, a \u201cfield-free\u201d principle that supports stable, non-destructive confinement of single macromolecules in room temperature fluids, representing a paradigm shift in a nearly century-old field. The spatio-temporal dynamics of a single electrostatically trapped molecule reveals fundamental information on its properties, e.g., size and electrical charge. The charge of a macromolecule is in turn a strong function of its 3D conformation - the molecular basis of biological function. I now aim to develop a new platform to study 3D macromolecular structure and temporal conformation by measuring the electrical charge of a single trapped molecule in real time, using both optical microscopy and electrical detection. Beyond the conformational dynamics of a single molecule, we will also examine interactions between two or more molecules, and the detection of minute structural differences between closely related molecular isoforms. We will further develop a novel approach to electrical transport measurements on single molecules aimed at generating for the first time a catalog of \u2018electrical signatures\u2019 for biomolecules in solution. The ability to experimentally link electrical charge and molecular structure will not only open up a new physical dimension in our understanding of macromolecules, but also advance the development of ultrasensitive, high-throughput molecular sensors for biomedical detection and analytics, potentially enabling an optical or electrical \u201csingle-snapshot\u201d read-out of the proteome or transcriptome of a single cell.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Market fragmentation has resulted in a multitude of network operators each focused on different countries and regions. This makes it difficult to create infrastructure services spanning multiple countries, such as virtual connectivity or compute resources, as no single operator has a footprint everywhere.\n\n5GEx aims to enable collaboration between operators, regarding 5G infrastructure services, with the view to introducing a unification via NFV\/SDN compatible multi-domain orchestration by producing (i) an open platform enabling cross-domain orchestration of services over these multiple domains, with a set of open source software tools and extensions that can be utilised outside the scope of 5GEx; (ii) a Sandbox Network enabling experimentation and validation of the devised architecture, mechanisms, and business models; (iii) a proof-of-innovation multi-domain platform enabling multiple 5G use-cases and realistic scenarios that demonstrate the orchestration of complex end-to-end Infrastructure as a Service across multiple carriers; (iv) contributions to standards bodies of concepts learned during the development and experimentation of the project; (v) input to stimulate the telecom and IT industry stakeholders by actively promoting adoption of 5GEx\u2019s open solutions.\n\nSuch 5G infrastructure services will provide a crucial role in making 5G happen as they provide the foundation of all cloud and networking services. 5GEx aims to enable, through operator collaboration, a unified European infrastructure service market integrating multiple operators and technologies, where service provisioning is fast and automated and which results in stronger economy via economies of scale.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"telecommunications":0.9,"data networks":0.8,"mobile network":0.8,"5G":0.9,"radio technology":0.7,"mobile radio":0.7,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

It is a major contributor to EU GDP and its size continues to grow fueled by demand from consumers to many industries. Despite its many positive impacts, the industry also faces some challenges connected with the enormous quantity of raw materials that it needs for sustainability, the huge quantity of Waste Electrical, Electronics Equipment (WEEE) generated and the threat of competition from Asia. To sustain its growth, to manage the impact of WEEE and to face the competition from Asia, the industry needs innovations in key areas. One such area is the drive for ultra-miniaturisation\/ultlra-functionality of equipment. The key current road block\/limitation to achieving the goal of ultra-miniaturisation\/functionality is how to increase the component density on the printed circuit board (PCB). This is currently limited by the availability of hyper fine pitch solder powder pastes. FineSol aims to deliver at first stage an integrated production line for solder particles with size 1-10 \u03bcm and to formulate solder pastes containing these particles. Thus, by proper printing methods (e.g. screen and jet printing) the fabrication of  PCBs with more than double component density will be achieved. Consequently, this would effectively enable more than a doubling of the functions available on electronic devices such as cell phones, satellite navigation systems, health devices etc. The successful completion of the FineSol project would lift the ultra-miniaturisation\/functionality road block and also enable reduction in raw material usage, reduction in WEEE, reduction in pollution and associated health costs and also a major reduction in EU energy demand with all its indirect benefits for environment and society.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: VISMEM - Visualising memories of violence in urban places: gender and wellbeing in Istanbul Abstract: Evidence shows that violence in urban areas affects women of all ages, socio economic and cultural backgrounds in particular (WHO 2014). The immediate and extensive costs of violence targeting women perpetuate the existing gender hierarchies by setting boundaries on women\u2019s movement, mobility, presence: that is, on their use of urban space. In addition to restrictions in mainstream social life, gendered violence is a systemic source of experiencing helplessness, humiliation, and distress which overall are a fundamental component of women\u2019s wellbeing. VISMEM will investigate the impact of place-based memories of violence among diverse women for their use of urban space, and interrogate the utility of visual methods for understanding that impact. More precisely, the study uses visual methods to explore diverse women\u2019s everyday negotiations of space in Istanbul, focusing in particular on their movements in relation to three research sites where forms of violence against women have occurred. VISMEM\u2019s overall objective is to develop a conceptual framework and visual tools for multisector policy and research engagement with memory as a key means to locate, assess, and ameliorate women's differential experience of violence and wellbeing in the city. Women in different social and spatial settings remember (and forget) the physical and mental effects of violence through personal experience and through popular accounts of its effects. The differential workings of memory in turn have implications on the lived experiences and wellbeing of a city's current (and future) residents\/visitors. Yet, the nexus of memory, place, gender remains disconnected from the multisector urban agenda on difference, inclusion, and wellbeing. VISMEM will provide transferable knowledge and policy-related results on the relation between gendered violence, memory, and will greatly improve our understanding of place memory as a focus in achieving gender-goals in urban social and spatial integration.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: MEESST - MHD Enhanced Entry System for Space Transportation Abstract: (Re-)entry into planetary atmospheres represents one of the most critical phases of space missions, involving high thermal loads on the vehicle surface and radio communication blackout which can last for minutes. As demonstrated with previous scientific studies, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) provides a framework for tackling both issues: high enough electromagnetic (EM) fields can be used to reduce heat fluxes and create a magnetic windowing able to mitigate the blackout. However, the translation of those ideas into an operational radically-new science-enabled technology to be used onboard spacecrafts has not been achieved yet. MEESST aims at filling the gap between science and technology towards the development of a first demonstrator implementing active magnetic shielding. To this end, a disruptive device consisting of a compact cryostat integrating a superconductive magnet able to generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields will be designed, manufactured, tested in on-ground experimental plasma facilities and via numerical simulations relying upon improved models. The latter will take into account, for the first time, all relevant EM-plasma interactions, thermochemical nonequilibrium and radiation effects for both Earth and Mars atmospheres. As a result, a radically-new science-enabled proof-of-concept technology will be developed and deployed, together with enhanced experimental techniques and modelling tools which can contribute to push European space technology one step ahead the competition, worldwide. The success of MEESST can introduce a paradigm shift in aerospace science and technology by turning active magnetic shielding (i.e. a futuristic concept traditionally associated to science fiction) into reality and potentially into the spotlight, not just for space travel but also for future hypersonic transportation systems, radar imaging, surveillance and GPS navigation, all requiring accurate knowledge of EM signal propagation characteristics through plasmas.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.2,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0.9,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.6,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.3,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: DECADE - Deploying High Capacity Dense Small Cell Heterogeneous Networks Abstract: Broadband mobile networks are experiencing exponential traffic growth. It is predicted that this trend will continue in the next five to ten years with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 0.6 to 1.0. Hence the traffic (mostly data) carried by a mobile operator\u2019s network in 2022 could be over 1000 times of that in 2012. This traffic growth presents a huge challenge to both the mobile industry and to academic researchers.\n\nAlong with increased spectrum efficiency, spectrum bandwidth expansion and traffic offloading through WiFi, small cell deployment is regarded as one of the most promising ways to meet the use of broadband mobile service in both outdoor and in particular indoor scenarios in the next decade. The deployment of small cells in a macrocell coverage area leads to a multi-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), in which a mix of access node types, such as macrocell, femtocell and relay, will co-exist. Despite the current research and development on small cell\/HetNet from both industry and academia, there are still many challenges to be addressed and questions to be answered for successful small cell and HetNet deployment. These challenges range from the lack of fundamental understanding of HetNet network capacity to the need of Radio Access Network (RAN) Planning and Optimisation (PO) tool for HetNet deployment involving both indoor and outdoor scenarios.\n \nThe DECADE project adopts the scheme of Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE), with the effect of inter-sectorial efforts and knowledge integration to tackle the challenges in HetNet planning and optimization. The research consists in fundamental capacity analysis, system modeling, algorithm development, and performance engineering for HetNets.

State leaders and diplomats continue to react to traditional media, but now also attempt to present themselves proactively through tweets, public diplomacy and nation branding. These efforts often take place simultaneously and sometimes interfere directly with closed-door negotiations and its culture of restraint and secrecy. Yet the relationship between confidential diplomacy and public representation remains understudied.\n\nDIPLOFACE will develop a sociologically and anthropologically informed approach to studying how state leaders and diplomats manage their nation\u2019s \u2018faces\u2019 in the information age. The project will explore the relationship and tensions between confidential diplomatic negotiations and publicly displayed interventions in various media, applying the micro-sociological concept of \u2018face-work\u2019. DIPLOFACE will analyse the complex interactional dynamics that shape the diplomatic techniques and strategies used to convey a nation\u2019s \u2018face\u2019 or \u2018image of self\u2019.

{"text":"Title: ssmscaifa - The Making of Modernist Resistance, 1880-1950 Abstract: The vibrant diversity of an increasingly global modernity owes much to the cross-cultural exchanges between British and Indian modernists during their collaborations in civil rights, anti-colonial, and anti-fascist activism from the 1880s to the 1950s. The proposed project examines the shifting nature of literary and political contributions to activist movements made by four such networks of British and Indian modernists to illuminate their integral role in creating what I contend is a distinctively modernist resistance. As early as the 1880s, theosophists from Britain partnered with renowned Indian spiritualists to bridge cultural gaps between colonizer and colonized through shared mystical experiences to emphasize an innate unity among human beings. By 1919, however, the disillusionment following World War I coupled with India\u2019s outrage about the Amritsar Massacre in which General Dyer and his troops opened fire killing hundreds of innocent Indians, supplanted such yearnings for unity with efforts to protect democratic freedoms from threats by right-wing extremists through a secular socialist resistance. Mulk Raj Anand, initially drawn to the liberal humanism of the Bloomsbury Group eventually joined the radical socialists of India\u2019s Progressive Writers Association in 1936. Women like Sarojini Naidu and Virginia Woolf fought for women\u2019s equality and opportunities to join in anti-right-wing resistance. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, influenced by the socialist ideologies of the Fabian Society, incorporated them into Indian nationalism and governance. This study explores the relationship between the ideologies of these networks to establish what the shift from spiritualism to secular socialist nationalism reveals about the nature of modernist resistance and the conditions of modernity that inspired it. The world view underpinning this resistance was integral in defining the post-war identities of Britain and India as secular socialist-leaning democracies.","gt":["radio and television"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.0,"radio frequency":0.0,"radar":0.0,"mobile phones":0.0,"bluetooth":0.0,"WiFi":0.0,"data networks":0.0,"optical networks":0.0,"microwave technology":0.0,"radio technology":0.0,"mobile radio":0.0,"4G":0.0,"LiFi":0.0,"mobile network":0.0,"radio and television":0.0,"satellite radio":0.0,"telecommunications networks":0.0,"5G":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Thus it is believed that collecting data using smart, easy to install self-powered wireless sensors would strengthen the competitiveness of the European aviation industry by providing the much desired SHMS function with very limited impact on complexity and weight and greatly ease maintenance operations. \nPrecisely, the SMARTWISE consortium ambitions to realise a self-powered versatile wireless sensor network platform dedicated to structural health monitoring with with specific objectives:\n- The proposed concept shall reduce the weight of a comparable wired SHMS system by at least 60%.\n- The prototype wireless sensors that will be delivered at the end of the project shall rely exclusively on self-generated energy (no pre-flight charging, cold start supported) and comply with the flight test regulations that will be agreed with the topic manager.\n- With respect to comparable wired solutions, the proposed wireless SHM system shall expose a potential of 50% installation and maintenance costs reduction.\n- The wireless SHM sensor network, including its power supply and on-board data processing parts shall cover 100% of the SHMS application requirements.\nThe partners have a long experience working together in Clean Sky and they propose a modular approach where a core wireless platform with advanced energy management can be interfaced to various sensors and energy harvesters.","gt":["radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.7,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.6,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.5,"radio technology":0.7,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

However, there are a number of research challenges that need to be addressed for a successful deployment of 5G\/B5G wireless networks: even if the theoretical background of massive MIMO is by now rather complete, the actual performance characterization and measurements of mmW antenna arrays has not yet been fully addressed at either the component or system level; mmW radio channel measurements have\nbeen performed but with limited time delay resolution, single antennas and over single radio links; and mmW bands have been considered for mobile communications, but the level of detail and diversity of BEs necessary for meaningful mmW SC deployment has not been fully exploited.

Today, lack of dynamic control across wireless network resources is leading to unbalanced spectrum loads and a perceived capacity bottleneck.

The goal of REVERSE is to develop and implement cost-effective strategies and tools for the prevention and clinical management of healthcare-associated infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens, and to reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance in high prevalence healthcare settings. To achieve these goals, REVERSE will use a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative research with implementation science and economic analysis. The aim is to produce results that go beyond the evidence-base we have today. REVERSE will answer the question about real-life effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes in combination with antibiotic stewardship on healthcare-associated infections due to multidrug-resistant microorganisms. It will offer implementation strategies to the participating hospitals but also study the effectiveness of external implementation support in a hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. REVERSE will develop a novel health-economic framework that allows for incorporating of effect of changes in the use of a range of antibiotics on antibiotic resistant infections, and estimating long-term population effects, to integrate both into cost-effectiveness analyses. It will be able to conclude on effectiveness and applicability of prevention strategies in lower-resource settings by cross-checking its programmes with activities in low-and-middle income countries.  Four European countries will have a platform of highly experienced hospitals to build on and expand a national network for combatting antibiotic resistance.

Notable steps have also been made towards shifting baseband processing from the (currently) ultra dense network edge to a central location where coordinated resource management will be performed. Nonetheless, the today\u2019s mobile network ecosystem includes vastly heterogeneous, evidently overlapping (in coverage) and fully isolated (in operation) attachment points that still handle most of the functions necessary for mobile data communications independently. Aiming to meet and surpass the requirements set for the 5G-and-Beyond mobile data network, in SPOTLIGHT we will create a fully-integrated and multi-disciplinary network of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) that will analyze, design, and optimize the performance of a disruptive new mobile network architecture: the SPOTLIGHT architecture. This architecture promises to break performance limitations present to the currently loosely inter-connected, resource-fragmented and isolated in operation mobile network ecosystem, by transforming the currently loosely-coupled multitude of heterogeneous and multi-layered RATs to a flat coalition of massively distributed antenna sub-systems that are optimally orchestrated by a cloud-empowered network core. Our primary aim will be to support for the first time self-including yet ultra-reliable radio communications at the edge network.

{"text":"Title: SOLOMON - Self-Organisation and Learning Online in Mobile Observation Networks Abstract: Smart cameras are embedded devices combining a visual sensor, a processing unit and a communication interface, allowing the processing of images on the device, such that only aggregated information, instead of raw video data, is transmitted. Smart camera networks are typically used for large-scale high value security applications such as person tracking in airports or amusement parks. However, current smart cameras are expensive and have only very limited mobility, acting as a barrier to their wider adoption. The SOLOMON project is driven by the rising demand for rapid-deployment camera networks which can adapt to provide security in the context of unforeseen situations and unfolding scenarios. This is evidenced by the rapid growth of leading body-cam company Edesix Ltd, whose VideoBadge technology is being adopted by police forces worldwide . However, recent research advances in smart camera networks have not yet been realised in dynamic body-worn camera networks, and still rely on prohibitively expensive static hardware. In the SOLOMON project we envision a novel type of lightweight, inexpensive smart camera network suitable for rapid deployment and reconfiguration, where low-cost camera devices such as Edesix\u2019s VideoBadge, are paired with the processing capabilities of smartphones. These are then worn by people (e.g. police, security guards) or mounted on mobile robots. This not only lowers cost, but allows us to introduce a feedback loop between the sensing cameras and the acting people\/robots, enabling the camera network to adapt to changes during runtime, for example to prioritise or cover newly relevant areas sufficiently. Novel techniques in collective decision making and self-organisation as well as multi-objective online learning will need to be developed, in order to achieve this vision.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.2,"mobile radio":0.2,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Focus will be on mature cities of medium size (Torino: 800.000 inhabitants, Villach 60.000, Calvi\u00e0 60.000, Venaria 35.000), where STEVE will generate data to support the design of next generation EL Vs, and provoke the mind-shift necessary for swift market penetration of them.\n\nThe primary idea of STEVE is to implement and test a human-centric approach to electro-Mobility-as-a-Service (eMaaS), according to the \u201cMove2Me\u201d vision of the consortium. This will provide low-cost and financially sustainable EL V solutions and \u201cgamified\u201d services, to enhance users\u2019 awareness, engagement and vehicle energy efficiency.\nA core item of STEVE is a low-cost electric quadricycle developed by a worldwide OEM in Turin, with start-of-production expected in 2018 at a market price of \u20ac8000. The quadricycle will integrate high-technology contents with respect to the current competitors, and will be pilot-tested, together with many other EL-Vs, during extensive demonstration phases in the four STEVE cities\nSTEVE will guarantee a strong impact in terms of business development and jobs, and enhance the European competitiveness in the eMaaS sector while also leveraging Manufacturing.\n\nThe consortium will also give a primary role to SMEs: while large enterprises will provide the underlying technologies, the services will be mainly designed and operated by SMEs, deeply involved in the local supply chains and adaptable to the specific customers\u2019 needs.","gt":["mobile network"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: ARTSFORMATION - Mobilising the Arts for an Inclusive Digital Transformation Abstract: Thirty years ago, the internet, social media and smartphones had not been invented. Yet a generation later, almost every facet of our individual, public and -now- online life are dominated by the fast-pacing digital transformation. Last year we saw the privacy and data of millions of social media users compromised with little to no accountability for those responsible, national elections influenced by users in different states, news outlets struggling to convince readers of facts, and the European Union taking proactive measure to protect the data privacy of its citizens in its first transnational regulatory action. Yet, the digital literacies and capabilities necessary for citizens to thrive in a digital society and act as responsible and effective participants, are unequally distributed across the European cultural, economic and social strata, with the public sphere consequently rapidly dissolving. ARTSFORMATION will respond through research, innovation and applied artistic practice to these societal challenges, by equitably developing the capacity of artists and citizens alike -including those from geographically remote, socio-economically excluded minority, refugee and migrant backgrounds- to respond cohesively in making their communities and groups resilient and adaptive in the 4th Industrial Revolution.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0.2,"WiFi":0.3,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0.2,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.3,"mobile radio":0.6,"4G":0.5,"LiFi":0.2,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0.4,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.4,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: A-LITHIA - Plastic nanoscale electronics via novel fabrication paradigms Abstract: Nanogap electrodes have been a highly attractive research area for over 25 years. This is mainly due to their potential for realising next generation nanodevices and circuit elements with lower power consumption, faster speed, and higher level of integration, as well as investigating the fundamental properties of materials at the nano- or even molecular level. However, the lack of a facile, inexpensive, high throughput technique for the manufacturing of dissimilar nanogap electrodes has hindered their commercial and scientific exploitation.\nIt is exactly at this junction that I strive to make significant advances with this proposal, by first implementing a novel patterning technique, adhesion lithography (a-Lith), to manufacture large aspect ratio (>100,000) metal electrode nanogaps (<50 nm) on a variety of substrates and then by fabricating and fully characterising nanoscale devices that will allow both understanding of the relevant device physics, alongside, advancing in device performance. \nHerein, I will firstly further develop the a-Lith key processing steps in order to establish a reliable protocol for the controlled geometry and uniform nanogap formation. Then I will follow a multidisciplinary research trajectory aiming at the development of high performance co-planar nano-scale electronic devices. Targeted proof-of-concept applications include radio frequency rectifying Schottky diodes, non-volatile ferroelectric tunnel junction memories, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, piezoelectric nanogenerators and molecular nano-junctions, the architectures and dimensions of which would be difficult or far too expensive to obtain with traditional patterning techniques (e.g. e-beam lithography). Finally, during my secondment, I will pursue the successful demonstration of fully functional non-volatile ferroelectric tunnel memory array over large area flexible substrates that will pave the way to the industrial deployment of this highly promising technology.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.5,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: AiRT - Technology transfer of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) for the creative industry Abstract: Aerial photography and filming represent an indispensable resource for the Creative Industries (CIs). When filming in indoor environments, auxiliary devices as cable cams, camera rails, jibs, scaffolds or lifting platforms are being employed, enabling to realize special aerial camera shots.  With the rise of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), commonly known as drones, CIs are increasingly focusing on its use outdoors, providing significant advantages over current photography and filming techniques such as widening the creative possibilities and freedom of camera movement, less invasive and risky compared to auxiliary devices and affordable.\n\nHowever, RPAS cannot be professionally employed indoors by the CIs. Existing RPAS lack of a precise, robust and affordable indoor positioning system (IPS) as well as advanced safety features. Without a good IPS the control of the RPAS in indoor environments is particularly difficult and even unsafe. Currently, there are three IPS suitable for RPAS, but these are too expensive (\u20ac200k), or present large limitations (e.g. sensitive to light conditions) for its usage by CI SMEs. This jeopardizes the creative possibilities of CI and their competitiveness.\n\nHence, the main goal of AiRT project is to provide the European CI SMEs a tool that, by expanding their creative spaces will help them to offer new services, which in turn will increase their changes to grow within the European and international market. To accomplish this objective, AiRT project will develop the world\u00b4s first indoor RPAS specifically designed for professional use by the CIs.\n\nAs a result, over 900.000 European CI firms will benefit from the transfer of the latest advances in IPS, 3D scene reconstruction, navigation and active \/ passive safety measures into an intelligent indoor RPAS, being able to avoid both static and dynamic objects. In addition AiRT system could be programmed in order to fly autonomously, enabling the CIs to focus on the camera control.","gt":["radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Our users can interact\nwith the system in a walk-up-and-use manner without any user instrumentation.\n\nAs we are moving away from keyboards and mice to touch and touchless interactions, ironically, the main limit is the lack of\nany physicality and co-located feedback. In this project, we propose a highly novel vision of bringing the physical interface to\nthe user in mid-air. In our vision, the computer can control the existence, form, and appearance of complex levitating objects\ncomposed of \"\"levitating atoms\"\". Users can reach into the levitating matter, feel it, manipulate it, and hear how they deform it\nwith all feedback originating from the levitating object's position in mid-air, as it would with objects in real life. This will\ncompletely change how people use technology as it will be the first time that they can interact with technology in the same\nway they would with real objects in their natural environment.\n\nWe will draw on our understanding of acoustics to implement all of the components in a radically new approach. In particular,\nwe will draw on ultrasound beam-forming and manipulation techniques to create acoustic forces that can levitate particles\nand to provide directional audio cues. By using a phased array of ultrasound transducers, the team will create levitating\nobjects that can be individually controlled and at the same time create tactile feedback when the user manipulates these\nlevitating objects. We will then demonstrate that the levitating atoms can each become sound sources through the use of\nparametric audio with our ultrasound array serving as the carrier of the audible sound.

This  allows decoupling the control and user planes of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and achieving the benefits of Cloud-RAN without the enormous fronthaul latency restrictions. The use of end-to-end network slicing mechanisms will allow sharing the 5G ESSENCE infrastructure among multiple operators\/vertical industries and customising its capabilities on a per-tenant basis. The versatility of the architecture is enhanced by high-performance virtualisation techniques for data  isolation, latency reduction and resource efficiency, and by orchestrating lightweight virtual resources enabling efficient Virtualised Network Function placement and live migration. 5G ESSENCE leverages knowledge, SW modules and prototypes from various 5G-PPP Phase-1 projects,SESAME being particularly relevant.

{"text":"Title: IntelliGen - Advanced control platform for next generation Free Piston Engines (FPEs) for clean and efficient power generation Abstract: Clean and efficient Free Piston Engines (FPEs) offer numerous advantages over traditional ICE architectures. Despite some high-profile attempts (Volvo, General Motors, Toyota), FPEs have not yet realised large scale commercial applications as it is very challenging to control the motion of the piston sufficiently. This is a substantial engineering challenge requiring multiple control operations to be performed repeatedly in a millisecond timescale to combat piston drift. There is a need for a flexible platform technology that enables FPEs to address the large range of potential use-cases, and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. IntelliGen is a ground-breaking platform technology for precise control of Free Piston Engines (FPEs), an emerging class of ICEs, which enables higher fuel efficiency, ultra-low emissions, and reduction in the operating cost of power. Furthermore, FPEs are compatible with low carbon and renewable fuels. Due to inherent problems with controlling the variable motion of the piston, commercial FPE development programmes had stalled, until now. IntelliGen enables precise control of piston motion and allows FPE architectures to be designed and scaled to suit any application including automotive and mobile power generation. The revolutionary platform unlocks the vast potential residing in FPEs, paving the way for the next 4 billion engines and a cleaner, more sustainable future. During the phase 1 feasibility study, Libertine will establish a sound go-to-market strategy and supply chain, and will outline further development plans. In the second phase of the innovation project, Libertine will optimise the platform, test and deploy a miniaturised FPE for automotive application, demonstrate medium volume production and obtain certification.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: Comedy and Politics - The Comedy of Political Philosophy.  Democratic Citizenship, Political Judgment, and Ideals in Political Practice. Abstract: Despite the rich history and contemporary relevance of the intersection of comedy, political practices, and political thought, comedy has thus far not received sustained attention in the field of political philosophy. This research programme will address this lacuna by developing parallels between (i) the specific outlook on human action offered by comedies and (ii) the perspective of a tradition of political thought known as political realism.\n\nThe overall objective of this research programme is to demonstrate that comedy reflects the theoretical and methodological commitments of political realism, and to establish comedy\u2019s contribution to realism by drawing out realism\u2019s transformative potential. \n\nThree specific research objectives will be combined to support the overall objective. (a) The first objective will develop an account of democratic citizenship informed by comedy by exploring Aristophanes\u2019 comedies. (b) The second objective will develop an account of political judgment informed by comedy, by analysing Machiavelli\u2019s comedies and political writings in relation to each other. (c) The third objective will develop an account of the relation between ideals and practice in politics informed by comedy by drawing on theoretical reflections on comedy by Hegel, Vischer, and Marx. \n\nEach of the specific research objectives corresponds to a central feature of political realism. By developing these objectives through comedy, the researcher will explicate structural parallels between comedy and political realism. In each of the specific objectives, the transformative potential inherent in comedy will be elucidated. In doing so, the researcher will use insights derived from this parallel to develop a more nuanced understanding of political realism\u2019s potential to conceptualize social transformation. Thus comedy transpires as the means through which the full potential of realism for political philosophy as a whole can be grasped for the first time.","gt":["teleology"],"preds":{"teleology":0.9,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

The modified PAN catalysts developed at DMU has eliminated the need for iron removal post treatment and has broadened the pH range of application, whilst enabling continuous flow processes favoured by industry. In recent years, several reports have demonstrated the use of microwave and ultraviolet radiation to promote the oxidative degradation of bio-refractory wastes due to their advantages of speeding up the reaction, high-efficiency with no pollution to the environment. Nevertheless the use of microwaves in catalysis and in the water and wastewater industry remains at laboratory scale and therefore requires further in depth research. The major challenges in the water\/wastewater industries are centered on the poor penetration depth of microwaves.

Abstract: Broadband has become an essential part of 21st-century infrastructure. New cloud services are making it a necessity for starting and growing small businesses, as well as advancing a wide variety of industries. However, more than half of the world's population still does not have access to internet being at a disadvantage; and the digital gap will continue to grow wider. Traditional wireless networks are expensive to install or expand and consequently low subscriber areas and less lucrative developing regions will likely never see cellular access. As an alternative, satellite access offers more than 5,000 times the spectrum compared to terrestrial networks -plus it is global and cover land, sea and air. Nevertheless, this technology is held back by current ground-based terminal (antenna) solutions that are expensive, single beam, require high power and have limited scalability.\n\nIsotropic\u2019s Radio Frequency (RF) Beamformer technology is a highly innovative system that exploits the science of transformational optics to provide the self-aligning ability of large phased array antennas but with significantly reduced complexity. This allows for drastically reduced cost and power consumption whilst increasing operational flexibility and performance. RF Beamformer is an ultra-low cost antenna technology that enables an optimised ground-based terminal that is otherwise currently missing in the industry development roadmap.\n\nTo date we have received $6M in venture capital and following successful results from founder\u00b4s research, the technology has reached TRL 5. We are now looking for funds to following our detailed product roadmap, translate our technology to products and bring satellite connectivity to the mass market by 2021.\n\nThe proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME Instrument fits into our overall plan to reach the market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a fast sound wider deployment of RF Beamformer and its market uptake.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.9,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0.8,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}

Industry 4.0 - also called smart manufacturing, digital industry or industry of the future \u2013 provides several technological responses to the challenging competitive market. Indeed, the integration of the Internet of Things and related components - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Security, Cloud Computing and Big Data - in manufacturing SMEs will improve efficiency and flexibility in production and consumption. However, it requires a more integrated and cooperative approach due to the high interdisciplinarity which has been introduced. Above all, not all manufacturing companies, and in particular SMEs, have access to smarter means of production, due to costs and efforts in the integration and implementation, possible aversion or readiness to ICT technologies, and other obstacles related to cyber and physical security. The IoT4Industry project connects 3 Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) clusters having strong competences in IoT with 4 Advanced Manufacturing clusters having access to tool manufacturers and manufacturing SMEs in order to encourage cross-border and cross-sectorial collaboration between SMEs from these two sectors. Starting from the analysis of needs in manufacturing SMEs from diverse sectors in Europe (aerospace, automotive, medicine, ...) on the one hand, and the IoT technology offer on the other hand, the project will put in place favourable framework conditions to enable matchmaking and encourage the creation of smarter manufacturing tools and their integration in manufacturing SMEs. A hundred of support cases involving SMEs corresponding to different development stages (feasibility, prototyping, demonstration) will be selected through a call for proposals to receive funding and support, in view of further developing this new industrial value chain in European SMEs and improve their competitiveness on the global stage.","gt":["bluetooth"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

The new compounds are particularly suitable for the fabrication of OLEDs via cheap solution-processing techniques and have so far reached 27% external quantum efficiency, a record for any solution-processed device. The new complexes have a linear, rotationally flexible structure, and it is this rotation that allows 100% of the excitation energy to be harvested, by a new emission mechanism (\u201crotationally accessed spin-state inversion\u201d, RASI). OLEDs are widely used as flat-screen displays (TVs, smartphones), a multi-billion dollar market worldwide. The industry-leading emitters are based on complexes of iridium, one of the rarest elements on earth. Our emitters are compounds of copper, silver and gold, suitable as \u201cslot-in\u201d replacements of iridium. IPR is protected by two UK and one PCT World patent applications. The key discovery is that in certain types of coordination complexes based on carbene ligands the excited singlet state sinks below the excited triplet state during molecular rotation. To our knowledge this is the first realization of \"\"spin-state inverted\"\" materials, until now discussed only as a theoretical concept.

{"text":"Title: CLEAN-HEAT - A highly efficient intelligent industrial microwave heating system based on high power solid state technology Abstract: Magnetrons are the most widely used microwave technology today for both industrial and domestic microwaves. But these systems can only achieve efficiencies of around 45 to 50%, pose safety risks as the use high voltages (5kV) and the magnetrons have a short lifespan requiring frequent replacement. Magnetron technology does not allow for the automatic adjustment of power level to match the load variations. These limitations have a huge cost to industrial microwave processes and there are calls for more efficient solutions.  Across Europe, microwaves consume over 9.6 TWh of electrical energy annually.\nF&M seeks to upscale its 200W solid state continuous wave microwave system to address these limitations. The 1kW gallium nitride based microwave system will save at least 25% on electricity consumption, operate at more than 70% efficiency, allow automatic adjustment of power level in response to load variations and significantly reduce equipment size. It will also provide increased lifespan eliminating the need for frequent and costly replacements.  With all these excellent features and performance advantages, our product also comes at a very competitive cost to the user which lies in the same range with the magnetron systems.\nSolid state microwave technology can be used in moisture meters, medical applications like RF-Surgery, and microwave ovens for the manufacture of electronic assemblies. It also offers opportunity for automatic power matching that enhances energy efficiency and faster processing speeds. Full adoption of our technology in both domestic and industrial microwave ovens would lead to potential energy savings of 6.74TWh of electrical power across Europe.","gt":["microwave technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.9,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Global mobile data traffic grew 81 % in 2013 and reached 1.5 Exabyte\u2019s per month at the end of 2013, up from 820 petabytes per month at the end of 2012. Users now demand fast and affordable connectivity when and wherever they are. The growing use\/ownership of laptops, tablet computers and larger smart phones has also led to an increasing demand for high quality content such as HD video on the move. \n\nCurrent satellite communications antennas cannot fully meet this large and growing need: Mechanically steerable antennas which are bulky, heavy, require maintenance and pose considerable vehicle integration challenges. Phased arrays based on military technology are too costly for commercial applications. Existing low cost antennas trade-off the cost of the antenna against the requirement for much more expensive satellite bandwidth per Mbps transmitted. Their performance is also too limited for use in certain geographical areas (particularly at large skew angles).  \n\nThe overall objective of this project therefore is to successfully refine and scale up for market readiness the world\u2019s first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile phased antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move.

{"text":"Title: QUSON - Quantum Sensing with Quantum Optical Networks Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits effects such as entanglement to enhance the sensitivity of measurement devices. In the last decade we have witnessed a significant advance in experimental platforms such as trapped ion setups and superconducting circuits. These systems are never free from noise and dissipation, however, interactions between qubits and photons or phonons can be controlled with lasers or external fields. Even in strong dissipative regimes, cooperative effects may induce complex quantum dynamics with emergent phenomena such as non-equilibrium phase transitions and multistability. The question then arises whether we can exploit those many-body effects in robust metrological protocols. \nMy project will address this question in two main scenarios corresponding to different limits of a network of qubits coupled to photonic cavities. Firstly, I will consider a limit of weak coupling, in which cooperative radiative decay leads to the generation of entanglement. Secondly, I will investigate networks of qubits strongly coupled to photonic cavities. I will identify, and systematically investigate, points close to non-equilibrium phase transitions in which the abrupt response of the system can be used to accurately measure properties of driving fields. The project requires a rigorous theoretical description of the qubit-cavity network. Approximations such as a mean-field theory can be used for a preliminary study. However, to achieve my goals I will need to properly describe quantum correlations across the system. I will address this challenge by using Matrix Product States methods - an advanced quasi-exact numerical technique. \nMy reference systems will be trapped ion setups and superconducting qubits coupled to microwave resonators. In my project, I will systematically investigate their performance as quantum sensors under realistic conditions.

{"text":"Title: Photonic Radar - Implementation of Long Reach Hybrid Photonic Radar System and convergence over FSO and PON Networks Abstract: The conventional radar systems, operating in mm-wave (MMW) i.e. beyond 30 GHz, are exposed to high free-path losses (\u2265 1 dB\/km) and the situation becomes more punitive under severe environment conditions, for instance, Heavy rain and fog. Moreover, the traditional radar distribution networks are realized with conventional cables or space-feeds that results in a massive, complex and inflexible system. To overcome these issues, the hybrid photonic-based radar system (PHRAD) emerges as a promising candidate, providing low-loss, immunity to EM interference and high bandwidth capacity. These robust properties of photonics play a vital role in realization of PHRAD transceiver with improved navigation and detection. Although, the possibility of multiband PHRAD, capable to work in both S-and X-band, becomes feasible that reduces the weight, size and cost of the system. Alternatively, the state-of-the-art electronic techniques have not the required potential to make such radars feasible. The key goal of the proposed project is to develop a PHRAD transceiver tunable over a wide frequency range (\u2265 40GHz) and immune to phase fluctuations in order to realize a robust navigation and detection system capable of providing high imagery-resolution and accuracy.

During initial pilot operations, supported by European Commission R&D funding , GPS-based solution (embedded on the tablet device of the vehicle) has proven not to be a reliable solution because of:\n\u2022 Lack of availability in certain areas of the city (deep urban)\n\u2022 Positioning errors, and therefore misleading scooter location information to user\nTherefore, G-MOTIT project aims to overcome these problems by developing and integrating an EGNSS-based location technology. The location solution will be validated both functionally and operationally through a small-scale demonstration in Grand Paris region.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.6,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: CHARISMA - Converged Heterogeneous Advanced 5G Cloud-RAN Architecture for Intelligent and Secure Media Access Abstract: CHARISMA proposes an intelligent hierarchical routing and paravirtualised architecture that unites two important concepts: devolved offload with shortest path nearest to end-users and an end-to-end security service chain via virtualized open access physical layer security (PLS). The CHARISMA architecture meets the goals of low-latency (<1ms) and security required for future converged wireless\/wireline advanced 5G networking. This provides a cloud infrastructure platform with increased spectral and energy efficiency and enhanced performance targeting the identified needs for 1000-fold increased mobile data volume, 10-100 times higher data rates, 10-100 times more connected devices and 5x reduced latency. \n\nFully aligned and committed to the 5G-PPP principles and KPIs, the CHARISMA proposal brings together 10G-wireless (via mm-wave\/60-GHz & free-space optics, FSO) access and 100G fixed optical (OFDM-PON) solutions through an intelligent cloud radio-access-network (C-RAN) and intelligent radio remote head (RRH) platform with IPv6 Trust Node routing featuring very low-latency for the traffic management. Low-cost Ethernet is used across front- and backhaul, and end-user equipment (vCPE), and intelligence distributed across the back-, front-hauls, and perimetric data transports. Ad-hoc mobile device interconnectivities (D2D, D2I, C2C etc.), content delivery network (CDN) and mobile distributed caching (MDC) offer an energy-efficient (better than x20 improvement possible) information-centric networking (ICN) architecture. Furthermore, caching will provide efficient utilization of scarce resources by early aggregating data or\/and by executing communication locally. \n\nThe CHARISMA approach will benefit user experiences with ground-breaking low-latency services, high-bandwidth, and mobile cloud resilient network security.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0.8,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.6,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.8,"cognitive radio":0.1,"fixed wireless network":0.9}}
{"text":"Title: SUN-PILOT - Subwavelength Nanostructure Pilot (Sun-Pilot) Abstract: Nanostructured surfaces that engineer the interaction between an object and its surroundings are a subject of scientific and manufacturing importance. Nature routinely creates nanostructured surfaces with fascinating properties, such as antireflective moth eyes, self-cleaning lotus leaves, colourful butterfly wings, and water harvesting desert beetles. Well defined nanostructured surfaces have huge commercial potential due to product enhancement: reduced reflectivity in photonic devices and solar panels, antiglare plastic parts for the automotive industry, hydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces for smart packaging, antireflective and smudge-free smartphone displays, and biofouling resistant marine and water treatment systems. Unfortunately, the lack of cost-effective, scalable, nanopatterning methods is a major hurdle for the commercial exploitation of nanopatterned surfaces. SUN-PILOT will address this challenge by developing a novel and cost effective platform for up-scaling sub-wavelength nanostructures fabrication techniques that can be applied to curved surfaces such as optical lenses, and the mass production of metal moulds for injection moulding of plastic parts. The expected impact of SUN-PILOT for the Optics Industry is a disruptive technology that will boost the performance\/cost ratio of photonic devices by piloting mass fabrication of scratch and wear resistant nanopatterned antireflective optical surfaces. Significant enhancement will be achieved in the efficiency of optical components and systems incorporating these devices, such as laser systems, electronic displays, security cameras and medical devices. The Automotive Industry will benefit from a novel method to produce functional surfaces at lower cost and lighter weight than existing lamination methods.  This proposal brings together scientists and engineers to span innovation, business development and the product cycle from suppliers to end users and will ensure a leadership role of for Europe.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0.8,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: TrustVehicle - Improved trustworthiness and weather-independence of conditional automated vehicles in mixed traffic scenarios Abstract: Automated driving can be implemented with relatively simple controllers if the current location of the ego vehicle and the current and future locations of other road users are known without uncertainty. However, this is not going to happen in the initial stages of the introduction of automated driving systems into the market. As a consequence, system and human driver uncertainty pose a significant challenge in the development of trustable and fault-tolerant automated driving controllers, especially for conditional automation (SAE level 3) in mixed traffic scenarios. The TrustVehicle consortium brings together participants from the whole vehicle value chain to enhance safety and user-friendliness of level 3 automated driving systems. The main objectives are: (i) the systematic identification of critical road scenarios based on in-depth analysis of possible traffic situations and human behaviour; (ii) the setup of new tools for the cost- and time-effective assessment of driver-in\/off-the-loop situations; (iii) design of controllers and sensor fusion systems capable of dealing with complex, uncertain and variable road scenarios to enhance road safety; (iv) the implementation of intuitive human-machine interfaces for the safe management of the transition phases taking into account user acceptance and gender-specific aspects; and (iv) the establishment of an adaptive and agile vehicle validation based on self-diagnostics and data logging to steadily extend the list of relevant scenarios and test cases. The outputs of the TrustVehicle project will be extensively assessed in real-world operating conditions on four demonstrators representing four vehicle classes. End users of the technology will systematically and thoroughly express their requirements, expectations, and concerns during the consortium activity. Special focus will be put on the demonstration of the fault-tolerant and fail-operational system behaviour at any time and for different kinds of weather conditions.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

In this dynamic field, the challenges are always evolving and more stringent in line with market expectation, and socio-economical requirements. \nThe chapter of 4G (4th Generation) of mobile systems is finally coming to an end, with waves of 4G systems deployed over Europe and worldwide. 4G systems provide a universal platform for broadband mobile services at any time, any place and anywhere. However, mobile traffic is still growing at an unprecedented rate and the need for more sophisticated broadband services is still further pushing the limits on current standards to provide even tighter integration between wireless technologies and higher speeds. The increase in number of mobile devices and traffic, the change in the nature of service and device, along with the pressure on operation and capital costs, and energy efficiency are all continuously putting stringent limits on the requirement of the design of mobile networks. It is widely accepted that incremental enhancements of current networking paradigm will not achieve or come close to meeting the requirements of networking by 2020 . This has led to the need of a new generation of mobile communications: the so-called 5G. The interests of stakeholders and academic researchers are now focused on 5G paradigm. Although 5G systems are not expected to penetrate the market till 2020, the evolution towards 5G is widely accepted to be the convergence of internet services with existing mobile networking standards leading to the commonly used term \u201cmobile internet\u201d over heterogeneous networks (HetNets), with very high connectivity speeds. \nThis proposal aims to narrow the gap between current networking technologies and the foreseen requirements of future 2","gt":["mobile phones","radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.9,"4G":0.9,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

Energy vertical represents undoubtedly one of the most significant \u201ctest cases\u201d for 5G enabling technologies, due to the need of addressing a huge range of very diverse requirements to deal with across a variety of applications (stringent capacity for smart metering\/AMI versus latency for supervisory control and fault localization).However, to effectively support energy utilities along their transition towards more decentralized renewable-oriented systems,  several open issues still remain as to 5G networks management automation, security, resilience, scalability and portability.  To face these issues, NRG-5 will research and develop a novel  5G PPP-compliant software framework specifically tailored to the energy domain, which combines i) trusted, scalable and lock-in free plug \u2018n\u2019 play support for a  variety  of  constrained devices;  ii) 5G devices\u2019 abstractions to demonstrate mMTC, uMTC and xMBB communications coupled with partially distributed, trusted, end-to-end security and MCM to enable secure, scalable and energy efficient communications; iii) extended Mobile Edge Computing (xMEC) micro-clouds to reduce backhaul load, increase the overall network capacity and reduce delays, while facilitating the deployment of generic MTC-related NFVs and utility-centric VNFs; iv) an extended 5G ETSI-MANO predictive analytics framework to support automated, dynamic, elastic VNF reconfiguration.

To tackle these challenges and move beyond the state-of-the-art, ECoWeB uniquely integrates three multidisciplinary approaches: \n(a) For the first time to our knowledge, we will systematically use an established theoretical model of normal emotional functioning (Emotional Competence Process) to guide the identification and targeting of mechanisms robustly implicated in well-being and psychopathology in young people; \n(b) A personalized medicine approach: systematic assessment of personal Emotional Competence (EC) profiles is used to select targeted interventions to promote well-being: \n(c) Mobile application delivery to target scalability, accessibility and acceptability in young people. \nOur aim is to improve mental health promotion by developing, evaluating, and disseminating a comprehensive mobile app to assess deficits in three major components of EC (production, regulation, knowledge) and to selectively augment pertinent EC abilities in adolescents and young adults. It is hypothesized that the targeted interventions, based on state-of-the-art assessment, will efficiently increase resilience toward adversity, promote mental well-being, and act as primary prevention for mental disorders. The EC intervention will be tested in cohort multiple randomized trials with young people from many European countries against a usual care control and an established, non-personalized socio-emotional learning digital intervention.

{"text":"Title: TalkingHeads - TalkingHeads: Audiovisual Speech Recognition in-the-wild Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition refers to the problem of recognizing speech using both audio and video information. Speech is not a purely auditory process but the way that the listener perceives it is also through the recognition of the visual patterns associated with the mouth movement. This correlation of the audio-visual information has been occasionally explored in literature in order to develop more robust automatic speech recognition systems for cases in which the auditory environment is noisy (e.g. background noise, multiple speakers). However, the problem of audio-visual speech recognition has been mainly studied in controlled, laboratory conditions. TalkingHeads proposes, for the first time, the problem of audio-visual speech recognition in unconstrained (in-the-wild) videos collected from real-world multimedia databases and a set of methodologies that will work well under the assumed in-the-wild setting. \n\nTalkingHeads brings together a talented but experienced researcher (ER) with expertise in speech analysis (diarization and recognition) and the Supervisor with large research experience in Computer Vision for face analysis in-the-wild (recognition, detection, alignment and tracking, and facial expression analysis). TalkingHeads will establish the ER as an independent and internationally recognized researcher in the area of audio-visual fusion and speech recognition. Through TalkingHeads\u2019 achievable work plan, the ER will attain a high level of research maturity by (a) complementing his expertise on speech analysis through extensive training in Computer Vision, (b) conducting research on a challenging research problem (audio-visual speech recognition in-the-wild) with significant career opportunities in both the academia and the industry, (c) publishing at high impact factor  conferences and journals, (d) establishing a network of research collaborators, and (e) enhancing personal skills (e.g. supervisory experience, leadership and management skills).","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.6,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.7,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0.7,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Power is also a key aspect in mixed-criticality systems as another resource (together with time and space) that has to be shared among different applications and has to be strictly controlled not to cause undesired interferences.\nThe main objective of SAFEPOWER is to enable the development of mixed-criticality systems with low power, energy and temperature  in combination with safety, real-time and security support by a reference architecture orchestrating different local power-management techniques. SAFEPOWER builds a comprehensive suite of multi-core platform technologies as well as analysis, simulation and verification tools for low-power mixed-criticality systems, including hardware and software reference platforms assisting the implementation, observation and test of such applications. SAFEPOWER will demonstrate the benefits through two industrial use-cases and a cross-domain public demonstrator. The safety concept of SAFEPOWER will be assessed by an external certification authority and consider reference domains and safety standards (e.g. industrial IEC-61508, railway, automotive, aerospace).\nSAFEPOWE brings significant improvements w.r.t. power, energy, temperature, availability and lifetime of CRTES as well as new types of competitive products operating with limited energy.

Thus, public 5G networks will not be able to address, in the short term, the promise of novel critical communication services required by vertical users. Private 5G and beyond 5G networks are seen as a promising way to bridge this gap, allowing private venues to deploy the required 5G capabilities early on. Factories and private venues, like stadiums or transportation hubs, are seen as key early adopters of these technologies.\n5G-CLARITY puts forward a beyond 5G architecture for private networks, which features a novel access network integrating 5G, WiFi, and LiFi, compute and transport resources, and novel management components to enable AI driven network automation. Based on this architecture, 5G-CLARITY will define communication services that deliver measurable enhancements with respect to the eMBB and URLLC services defined by 3GPP in Release 16, in terms of low latency, area capacity, reliability, and accurate positioning and synchronization capabilities.

{"text":"Title: COREGAL - Combined Positioning-Reflectometry Galileo Code Receiver for Forest Management Abstract: Biomass mapping has gained increased interest for bioenergy, climate research and mitigation activities, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (e.g. REDD initiative).\n\nHowever, continuous deforestation activity and forest management requires frequent and accurate monitoring which can be expensive and difficult to attain. In Brazil, optical satellite data is typically used by government but even such does not allow accurate enough mapping due cloud coverage, requiring combination of other sources such as in-situ and air-borne measurements. Furthermore, satellite radar signals can penetrate clouds but still today the spatial resolution is not sufficient.\n\nIn COREGAL, a low cost unmanned fixed-plane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and service for biomass mapping will allow wide scale mapping in the Brazilian context of forest management. A first of a kind combined Position-Reflectometry Galileo receiver will be developed as main sensor for platform positioning and biomass estimation, the latter using reflected GNSS signals (also called GNSS-R) on tree canopies. High positioning accuracy (centimetre level) is required for surface point reflection determination, which is challenging for remote areas where no GNSS infrastructure is available as in the case of many forests in Brazil. However, Galileo AltBOC E5 signals offer unprecedented pseudorange measurement quality which can be used for novel high accuracy positioning.\n\nThe UAV will be equipped and tested with a COREGAL receiver and optical cameras for aerial mapping and biomass estimation, enabling wide scale low cost mapping: UAV mapping is at least one order of magnitude lower cost than manned air-borne missions while GNSS-R can be seen as bi-static radar replacing expensive, heavy and power consuming radars. \n\nThe consortium includes universities and companies for successful services and technology exploitation.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"radar":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radio technology":0.7,"satellite radio":0.6,"data networks":0.4,"optical networks":0.3,"microwave technology":0.2,"telecommunications":0.2,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile radio":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.1,"5G":0.1,"teleology":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: RECENT - Ultra-Dense Unsupervised Heterogeneous Wireless Cloud Coded Networks for 5G\/B5G Abstract: \"Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks will undoubtedly have greatly increased density and scale compared to current networks, resulting in massive interaction between nodes. It will be infeasible to provide fixed connections to all access nodes, and hence these networks will evolve towards a heterogeneous, multihop, self-organizing architecture. Moreover, for several significant B5G scenarios (such as vehicular networks in \"\"smart cities\"\") the topology may be a priori unknown and rapidly time-variant: therefore, it will be impractical to provide a global coordinating authority, and hence these networks will be essentially unsupervised. (Security remains paramount, and physical security mechanisms especially appropriate.) The conventional networking paradigm will be severely limited by interference in these scenarios, greatly reducing efficiency. It has already been shown in both theory and practice that wireless physical-layer network coding (WPNC) is nevertheless capable of resolving this situation because it can allow relay nodes to extract useful information from all combined received signals, rather than treating them as deleterious interference. \nHowever, previous work on WPNC [1-5] has not addressed the case of large-scale, unsupervised, secure, dynamic networks. RECENT will address such networks starting with fundamental theory and technology, including information theory, network coded modulation (NCM) for WPNC, stochastic network theory, and physical layer security. The developed technologies will be deployed and validated in the system level simulator and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. Running in parallel to the technical activities, a rigorously crafted innovation management programme will assess business opportunities of RECENT technologies, taking into consideration standards and regulation, and hence ensure that they achieve their full industrial and societal impact.\"","gt":["5G","radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.6,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: QMiCS - Quantum Microwave Communcation and Sensing Abstract: \"The mission of QMiCS is to combine European expertise and lead the efforts in developing novel components, experimental techniques, and theory models building on the quantum properties of continuous-variable propagating microwaves. QMiCS\u2019 long-term visions are (i) distributed quantum computing & communication via microwave quantum local area networks (QLANs) and (ii) sensing applications based on the illumination of an object with quantum microwaves (quantum radar). With respect to key quantum computing platforms (superconducting circuits, NV centers, quantum dots), microwaves intrinsically allow for zero frequency conversion loss since they are the natural frequency scale. They can be distributed via superconducting cables with surprisingly little losses, eventually allowing for quantum communication and cryptography applications. Radar works at gigahertz frequencies because of the atmospheric transparency windows anyways. Scientifically, QMiCS targets a QLAN demonstration via quantum teleportation, a quantum advantage in microwave illumination, and a roadmap to real-life applications for the second\/third phase of the QT Flagship. Beneath these three grand goals lies a strong component of disruptive enabling technology provided by two full and one external industry partner: the development of a microwave QLAN cable connecting the millikevin stages of two dilution refrigerators, improved cryogenic semiconductor amplifiers, and packaged pre-quantum ultrasensitive microwave detectors. The resulting \"\"enabling\"\" commercial products are beneficial for quantum technologies at microwave frequencies in general. Finally, QMiCS fosters awareness in industry about the revolutionary business potential of quantum microwave technologies, especially via the advisory third parties \u201cAirbus Defence and Space Ltd\u201d and \u201cCisco Systems GmbH\u201d.

{"text":"Title: SANSA - Shared Access Terrestrial-Satellite Backhaul Network enabled by Smart Antennas Abstract: The aim of SANSA project is to boost the performance of mobile wireless backhaul networks in terms of capacity and resilience while assuring an efficient use of the spectrum. Recently, a global mobile traffic increase of 11-fold between 2013 and 2018 was predicted, so novel solutions are required to avoid backhaul becoming the bottle neck of future mobile networks.  The solution envisaged in SANSA is a spectrum efficient self-reconfigurable hybrid terrestrial-satellite backhaul network based on three key principles: (i) a seamless integration of the satellite segment into terrestrial backhaul networks; (ii) a terrestrial wireless network capable of reconfiguring its topology according to traffic demands; (iii) a shared spectrum between satellite and terrestrial segments. This combination will result in a flexible solution capable of efficiently routing the mobile traffic in terms of capacity and energy efficiency, while providing resilience against link failures or congestion and easy deployment in rural areas. Therefore, we will develop novel smart antennas, dynamic radio resource management and data-based shared access techniques for enabling the spectrum sharing among both segments, as well as efficient management and routing solutions for the hybrid network. These studies will yield to the implementation and demonstration of the two key components proof of concepts:  (i) low-cost smart antennas (to be deployed in terrestrial nodes) with beam and null-steering capabilities for interference mitigation between satellite and terrestrial transceivers and network topology reconfiguration; (ii) hybrid network manager capable of controlling the resources of the hybrid network. Besides indirectly allowing the traffic increase to the mobile users, the SANSA project will set the path for a win-win collaboration between satellite and terrestrial operators that will strengthen both European sectors and also their related industries such as equipment manufacturers.","gt":["5G","radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.8,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.9,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0.8,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}

In 2008, more machines were connected to the internet than there are humans on the planet, and by 2020 there are predicted to be 50 billion machines connected to the internet.

THz technologies are also set to revolutionize a range of imaging, sensing, and quantum optics applications.\nRecently, tunneling devices have been shown to be the leading candidate in realizing compact, low cost, high performance THz transmitters and receivers once coupled to suitable antennas.

This powerful combination reflects an urban population of between 100k and 1,2m inhabitants across six different countries, allowing us to demonstrate successful replication across a wide range of typical urban areas in Europe. Each city has already made significant progress towards the transition of becoming a smart city; developing their own individual approach reflecting specific local circumstances. These inherent strengths will now serve to accelerate the smart city development across proposed demonstration sites within Triangulum.

{"text":"Title: PIRATE - PrInted gRAphene ThermocouplE for the IoTs Abstract: Accurate real-time temperature measurement is very important in many applications. In particular,  contact-type temperature sensors for nano or microscope measurement of temperature are expected to strongly rise in the next future due to their use in wearables, smartphones, and other consumer electronics devices. However, the development of sensitive and localised temperature sensor is a strong technical challenge, in particular when coupled with flexible substrates, such as those used for packaging and wearables, and the reduced manufacturing cost required for a sensor to be commercially suitable for many IoT applications. The aim of this project is to develop a printed thermocouple made of carbon-based inks, offering accurate temperature measurements as well as better sustainability and biocompatibility, compared to existing solutions.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.2,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.2,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Abstract: The idea for this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to develop a prototype of a location-based game (LBG) that can be used for teaching fieldwork in a Higher Education (HE) setting. The rationale behind it is that location-based games, understood here as  pervasive games in which gameplay develops through a player's mobile location, are promising educational tools for fieldwork, as they:\n\n-\tAre close to student\u2019s lifestyle as digital natives \n-\tOffer innovative and creative technologies for using methods in vivo. \n-\tOffers educators possibilities to monitor and supervise students\u2019 progress \n-\tAllow for different interactions between students, teachers and learning environments \n-\tAllow for more creative learning processes for understanding environments and people \n-\tOffer accessible and informal ways to break down barriers between researcher and \u201cresearched\u201d \n\nThe game we envisage to prototype will consist of an OpenStreetMap based GPS enabled mobile phone app that can be  used by students while conducting fieldwork. The game mixes spatial and qualitative approaches, that prompt students to complete certain educational tasks, plan routes , create narratives, or \u201cclaim\u201d certain spots or areas. The app will then feed data created by the students (GPS check-ins, images, texts, recordings) back to a main computer where the findings and activities  are collected, scored with points and evaluated by the teachers of the course. Through this central interface organisers of the course as well as BOTs (automated tasks\/non-playable entities in the game-world) can send messages, advise and tasks  to the participants, information that is also used to share and evaluate the results with students in the classroom. Likewise students can communicate with their supervisors while in the field through this central interface to ask for advise.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"mobile phones":0.9,"data networks":0.8,"mobile network":0.8,"telecommunications":0.7,"radio technology":0.6,"mobile radio":0.5,"telecommunications networks":0.5,"4G":0.4,"5G":0.3,"WiFi":0.2,"bluetooth":0.2,"radio frequency":0.1,"radar":0.1,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"teleology":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: SBS3-5 - Stimulated Brillouin Scattering based RF to Optical Signal Transduction and Amplification Abstract: While the detection of weak signals (down to the single photon level) in the optical frequency range is routine on account of the high photon energy (compared to thermal excitation energy kBT) and the availability of efficient detectors, this is not the case in the radio frequency (RF) and microwave frequency regimes wherein thermal (Johnson) noise in detectors swamps out the faint RF signals (in applications from radio astronomy, MRI to radar) and requires the use of cryogenic amplifiers. The ability to map signals efficiently from the microwave to optical regime becomes paramount for distant systems to communicate with each other using low loss telecom fibers. Both classical (radio over fiber systems) and quantum (linking two superconducting qubit processors in two dilution fridges) information processing systems will benefit greatly from the development of an efficient RF to optical signal transducer.\n I have been developing efficient RF to optical transduction schemes in GaAs cavity optomechanical systems (KC Balram et al., Nature Photonics (2016)) by exploiting its favorable piezoelectric (for coupling RF signals to propagating acoustic waves) and elasto-optic (for engineering strong acousto-optic interactions) properties. In this project, I would like to extend this work and address the issue of weak RF signal detection by up-converting RF signals to the optical domain using integrated Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and shot-noise limited optical detection. Piezoelectric SBS systems can also be used to build high frequency, high gain RF amplifiers with noise figures that can be lower than conventional RF amplifiers. Working in a novel GaAs on insulator platform helps provide some unique advantages (tightly confined acoustic and optical modes with large modal overlap and a large elasto-optic coefficient leading to significant Brillouin gain) while holding the potential for interfacing complex circuitry in a well-established III-V materials platform.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"radio frequency":0.9,"radar":0.8,"telecommunications":0.8,"optical networks":0.7,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.6,"data networks":0.5,"teleology":0.0,"mobile phones":0.0,"bluetooth":0.0,"WiFi":0.0,"LiFi":0.0,"mobile network":0.0,"radio and television":0.0,"satellite radio":0.0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0.9,"cognitive radio":0.1,"fixed wireless network":0.2}}
{"text":"Title: TCBI - Tracking children in their best interests: electronic monitoring in three European juvenile justice systems Abstract: The implementation of alternatives to deprivation of liberty throughout the juvenile justice procedure has been on the agenda of international children\u2019s rights for about 28 years. The urgent need for alternatives is based on the requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of Child to use measures that deprive children\u2019s liberty as last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. Accordingly, states have to develop suitable alternatives to detaining children for justice purposes. One of the currently popular alternative measures is surveillance of juvenile offenders by using electronic monitoring (EM) devices. EM ensures control through GPS or radio frequency technology, allowing juveniles to remain in or return to the community and maintain their ties with their families and peers. Although these measures seem to be popular among policy makers because of the high level of control, concerns are also raised about their harmful effects, which may be significant in childhood. \nThis research investigates how the application of EM suits the requirements set out by international documents on children\u2019s rights and how national or international policies may be improved towards a better compliance with children\u2019s best interests. The research will be implemented in England and Wales, Hungary and The Netherlands, using a variety of qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (survey) methods to investigate the research questions. The project will generate unique knowledge on multiple aspects of using EM measures in juvenile justice, which will, for the first time, develop understanding at a European level about EM from the perspective of children. It will demonstrate a unique, children\u2019s rights approach and involve different actors of the system, juvenile offenders and children, who will be approached via a number of channels.

Massive investments on the field and the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensors has moved relevant market uptakes for autonomous driving from 2035 to 2020. \nCAVs are equipped with a huge number of sensors that allow them to understand the environment and act accordingly. However, this technology is superfluous without knowing the location of the vehicle in real time. Technology used to position a mobile device on earth is known as Global Navigation Satellite System \u2013 GNSS (e.g. GPS or GALILEO). Despite it seems impossible, currently, there are not any GNSS solution that meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers for autonomous driving, due to: 1) excessive cost to be implemented at scale (low margin sector) 2) unavailability to provide location updates in real time under hostile GNSS conditions (e.g. urban canyons) and 3) lack of a reliability measure to detect when a location is not accurate enough. \nAt Albora, we have built and patented the Albora Correlation Engine, which uses AI and, in particular, biologically inspired Deep Learning Networks to achieve the performance required by the sector. Moreover, our technology can be embedded on the electronics currently available on autonomous vehicles, allowing us to keep the costs extremely low (no additional HW required!)\nTo exploit our product, we plan to build SW packages of our algorithms and sell licenses through an easy to use API (SW company approach).

{"text":"Title: OMICRON - Optical transmission based on integrability and nonlinear Fourier transform Abstract: \"Optical fibre systems form the backbone of global telecommunication networks and carry the bulk of the world's data traffic, serving as a key component of information and communication technology. Although over the years, these systems have become increasingly complex, the quality of optical system performance is still affected by the same key physical features: chromatic dispersion, fiber Kerr nonlinearity, and optical noise. Most of the current optical networks exploit the techniques that were originally developed for linear channels. Thus, it is not surprising that nonlinearity has a detrimental impact on such systems. It has been predicted that, within the next decade the existing optical fibre technology will approach the \"\"nonlinear transmission limit'', which caps the achievable rate of error-free data transmission.  Thus, in order to reach a the higher capacity of optical fibres it is necessary to shift the relevant information and communications technology paradigm by introducing truly nonlinear modulation, transmission, and signal processing techniques. The aim of this project is to develop ground-breaking visionary concepts and approaches to unlock the capacity of fiber-optic communications beyond the limits of current technology by treating optical fiber as the inherently nonlinear medium it is.

{"text":"Title: DAMOSET - With data-driven modelling towards a successful energy transition Abstract: The power grid is an integral part of the power system. It connects all electrical consumers with generators and powers everything from household appliances to large factory machinery. Without this grid, farmers would not be able to feed their animals, car factories would come to a halt, mobile phone systems would fail and many of us would not even be able to make a cup of tea. While the current power system is very reliable and offers a high quality of service, it remains unclear how this will develop in the future. The limited supply of fossil fuels as well as necessary reduction of CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, will eventually lead to a power grid mainly supplied by renewable generators, such as wind and solar plants. These plants output smaller total power so that a large number is necessary which have to be geographically distributed for optimal weather conditions. The current power grid system slowly emerged within several decades of optimization processes. However, now we are discussing how to revolutionize the whole energy system within years. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the current power system is necessary to develop potential pathways to a future 100% sustainable system. In the proposed research, I will use data-driven approaches to work towards a quantitative understanding of fluctuations in the power grid, as they are for example introduced by the changing demand or volatile energy generation. I will analyse the British as well as international grids to understand differences in grid operation and potential solutions for grids.

The exponential traffic growth is not uniform across geographical areas and mainly takes place in indoor hot spots. Hence, high capacity indoor venues represent the biggest network capacity increase challenge.\n\nThe recently emerged 3D MIMO technology provides a promising dimension to provide extra capacity gain in hot spots. In particular, the 3D deployment of small cells (SCs) equipped with 3D MIMO antenna arrays will take advantage of 3D distribution of user equipment (UE) in typical high capacity venues, and represents an excellent technical combination to address the indoor high capacity challenge. The 3D deployment of SCs with 3D MIMO antenna arrays faces technical challenges ranging from 3D MIMO antenna array design, performance evaluation, the lack of understanding of 3D MIMO SC network performance limits to the optimal 3D SC network deployment.\n\nThe is3DMIMO project aims to address these technical challenges by assembling a team of four partners in the UK, Sweden and China with complementary expertise. During the project, the is3DMIMO consortium aims to achieve the following objectives:\n\u2022\tcharacterize and model indoor 3D MIMO channels for typical indoor environments;\n\u2022\tdevelop a reliable OTA antenna characterization method for 3D MIMO SCs;\n\u2022\tcharacterize OTA performance in laboratory conditions as compared to real-life 3D MIMO small cell scenarios;\n\u2022\tobtain fundamental understanding of the network performance gains achievable by 3D SCs with 3D MIMO antenna arrays;\n\u2022\tdevelop techniques for jointly optimizing the deployment locations of SC access points (APs) and their 3D MIMO configurations; and\n\u2022\tprovide 3D MIMO SC network planning and deployment guidelines for typical 3D indoor scenarios. \nThe achievement of the above objectives will provide crucial inputs for multiple-antenna and 5G\/B5G system design, and will increase network capacity in indoor hot spots by 20-30%.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"mobile phones":0.7,"data networks":0.8,"mobile network":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: ORIONAS - Lasercom-on-chip for next generation, high-speed satellite constelation interconnectivity Abstract: The satellite market experiences a paradigm shift with the rise of satellite constellations that are changing the satellite volume launched from now on. Under increasing capacity requirements, primes admit that lasercom is required to connect their constellations at high speeds not possible with RF equipment. This is shaping a unique opportunity for the penetration of optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) into a market that will only grow. The deal for OISLs is clear; low cost, size, weight and power consumption (C-SWAP), but the current tools and methods used to make OISL systems are fundamentally incompatible with this requirement and the jump to satellite lasercom is a jump to higher complexity. ORIONAS aims to provide the technology that will disrupt the way lasercom systems are designed, built and tested and hit the right C-SWAP targets. ORIONAS invests in monolithic integration within European BICMOS and InP foundries for cost-effective access to high performance technologies. Using its photonics BICMOS integration platform, ORIONAS will squeeze lasercom transceivers into a few mm^2 demonstrating modulator\/driver electronic-photonic IC (ePIC) being >2 orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art space (SOTA) qualified modulators and receiver ePICs being 3 orders of magnitude smaller than conventional free space optics receivers used in current lasercom modems. ORIONAS will develop a Hi-rel packaging technology to deliver all-laser weldable, hermetic transceivers that will be 20 times faster and 16x times smaller than current SOTA lasercom systems and with power dissipation in the order of a few pJ\/bit. Using InP integration ORIONAS will fabricate SOAs being 2 orders of magnitude smaller than current space qualified high power fiber amplifiers and >10x times more powerful than current commercial SOAs.

It is well recognized nowadays that rapidly increasing data rates in the core fibre communication systems are quickly approaching the limits of current transmission technologies, many of which were originally developed for communication over linear (e.g. radio) channels. It is widely accepted that the nonlinear transmission effects in optical fibre represent now a major limiting factor in modern fibre-optic communication systems. Nonlinear properties make optical fibre channels considerably different from wireless and other traditional linear communications channels. There is a clear need for development of radically different methods for coding, transmission, and (pre & post) processing of information that take the nonlinear properties of the optical fibre into account and for training of a new generation of engineers with expertise in: optical communications, nonlinear science methods, digital signal processing (DSP), design of implementable algorithms. From the industry perspectives, design of practical and implementable processing algorithms requires knowledge of ASICs and real world conditions and restrictions.

{"text":"Title: MORPHEMIC - Modelling and Orchestrating heterogeneous Resources and Polymorphic applications for Holistic Execution and adaptation of Models In the Cloud Abstract: MORPHEMIC proposes a unique way of adapting and optimizing Cloud computing applications by introducing the novel concepts of polymorph architecture and proactive adaptation. The former is when a component can run in different technical forms, i.e. in a Virtual Machine (VM), in a container, as a big data job, or as serverless components, etc. The technical form of deployment is chosen during the optimization process to fulfil the user\u2019s requirements and needs. The quality of the deployment is measured by a user defined and application specific utility. Depending on the application\u2019s requirements and its current workload, its components could be deployed in various forms in different environments to maximize the utility of the application deployment and the satisfaction of the user. Proactive adaptation is not only based on the current execution context and conditions but aims to forecast future resource needs and possible deployment configurations. This ensures that adaptation can be done effectively and seamlessly for the users of the application. The MORPHEMIC deployment platform will therefore be very beneficial for heterogeneous deployment in distributed environments combining various Cloud levels including Cloud data centres, edge Clouds, 5G base stations, and fog devices. Advanced forecasting methods, including the ES-Hybrid method recently winning the M4 forecasting competition, will be used to achieve the most accurate predictions. The outcome of the project will be implemented in the form of the complete solution, starting from modelling, through profiling, optimization, runtime reconfiguration and monitoring. Then the MORPHEMIC implementation will be integrated as a pre-processor for the existing MELODIC platform extending its deployment and adaptation capabilities beyond the multi-cloud and cross-cloud to the edge, 5G, and fog.

We can build a platform that attracts these solo integrators and retains them by improving their travel experience, at the same time capturing individual journey data. That platform can then flip the transport integration problem by addressing it from the user level up.\nBy combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into an innovative, disruptive and competitive solution, we will enhance the profitability and growth performance of Mudlark (an SME).

{"text":"Title: ADENEAS - Advanced Data and power Electrical NEtwork Architectures and Systems Abstract: More Electric and Connected Aircraft (MECA) is one of the most promising enablers to reach Flightpath 2050. But MECA asks for more electrical systems, which exchange more data which can be safety critical, and consume more electrical power leading to higher thermal dissipation. This leads to complexity, weight penalty and increased exposure to intended (cybersecurity) and unintended (ElectroMagnetic Compatibility) interference. Overcoming these barriers requires an interdisciplinary cooperation and, in this context, the ADENEAS project emerged, aiming at paving the way for a safe, light, self-configuring, autonomous and modular power and data distribution network that is scalable to all aircraft sizes. To achieve this long-term objective, ADENEAS will define new architecture concepts, develop advanced Artificial Intelligence-based design tools, enabling technologies for intra-aircraft data communication and for power network and a cooling system. The project will also demonstrate the integration of the data and power network and cooling system, initiate standardisation activities and ensure commercial viability.\nTo achieve these objectives, ADENEAS will start from solid foundation of partner\u2019s background, previous and ongoing R&D activities and will implement a stepwise approach from the definition of requirements and reference case (for small, medium and large aircraft) up to the assessment and evaluation of the developed, tested and demonstrated technologies. This includes strong involvement of an Industrial Advisory Board as well as standardisation perspective.\nThe ADENEAS future proof power and data network, scalable to all aircraft size, will support the Flightpath 2050 objective by allowing to save 0.7% block fuel burn and >156,000 kg of CO2 emitted per aircraft per year and secondary by optimizing maintenance and providing novel technologies to be deployed for increased passenger experience.","gt":["data networks"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.2,"mobile radio":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Hence, the performance of network slicing heavily depends on characterizing and predicting the spatial- temporal traffic patterns for individual services in near real-time. \n\nResearch on characterization and prediction for service-level mobile traffic is still in nascence. Firstly, the traffic characteristics and predicting methods of individual services, especially the 5G services, have not been studied adequately. Secondly, traffic correlation among different services and the reasons behind it have not been well studied. Thirdly, inter-service correlations have not been well exploited in service-level mobile traffic prediction. \n\nIn this project, we will address these gaps. Firstly, we will study the spatial-temporal characteristics of service-level traffic patterns at multi-scales, based on which, we will investigate the traffic predicting frameworks for individual services. Secondly, for the first time, we will investigate the traffic correlation among different services and try to discover the underlying reasons by analyzing the service usage profiles of different user groups. Finally, based on inter-service correlations, we will investigate whether we can improve service-level traffic prediction accuracy and whether we could execute prediction for diverse services according to the historical records of only a few key services.\n\nThe success of the CORRELATION project will make proactive network slicing possible, which will then drive proactive network optimisation for 5G and beyond mobile networks.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.9,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

At present different techniques are needed to inspect the ballast, track substructure and tunnels. TRACKSCAN would undertake these activities and more through non-invasive inspection. Within Europe ballast inspection requires digging a trench or driving plastic lined steel tubes into ballast with a pneumatic hammer. This is obviously impractical, time consuming, labour intensive and can miss ballast fouling. TRACKSCAN inspects all ballast so that maintenance can be targeted and effective. The feasibility study proposed intends to verify the technological and practical aspects of the system and ensure the business concept is sound. The system is described in terms of what can be achieved the science behind it is retained as confidential, as permitted by the call. The penetrating radar system has a rotating antenna which allows 360 degrees inspection and in any plane, this means that unlike other ballast inspection systems in the US, the TRACKSCAN system can extend beyond the vehicle width. The TRACKSCAN system is innovative, unique and we believe has a large market potential. The areas of inspection include: ballast; sub-ballast including drainage systems; water pipes and utilities, tunnel linings and tunnel track systems and bridge surface structures.\nThere is already interest from infrastructure owners and maintenance organisations such as Turkish Railways (TCDD) who have indicated their support as potential user\/customers and will identify their needs and define the future work within Phase 2.

{"text":"Title: FreeATPOC - Towards an instrument-free future of molecular diagnostics at the point-of-care Abstract: Molecular diagnostics is still primarily a lab-based method. Emerging technologies for application at the point of care (POC) or need, i.e., where a patient or a sample is, have started gaining a big part of the molecular diagnostics market. Interestingly, available methods are divided in two groups: sophisticated instruments for ultra-sensitive temperature-regulated enzymatic amplification of nucleic acids and extremely simple paper-based immuno-diagnostic kits. Complexity, the main disadvantage of the former, results in their poor translation to several applications at the POC. Simplicity, often accompanied by failures, of the latter is the reason for their slow adoption even in resource limited areas. Our vision is an instrument-free approach that combines the advantages of both groups, i.e., a method that does not use heaters or modules that require electricity, infrastructure and maintenance, but, still, takes advantage of enzymatically-amplified nucleic acids detection. To achieve the above, novel diagnostic tools for genetic amplification based on ligases, polymerases and restriction enzymes operating at ambient temperature will be developed, combined with quantitative smartphone colorimetric\/UV detection. The global applicability of the new approach will be demonstrated during infectious disease (Influenza and HIV) testing in human samples (blood and swabs) and plant pathogens (Xylella fastidiosa) in plant-tissues. In all cases, we aim for a time-to-result of less than 60 min, demonstrated sensitivities down to the clinically\/field relevant values and a final cost in the order of $1 per assay. Combination of Free@POC concept with newly developed predictive models will expand its utility to monitoring disease outbreaks and their spreading. This new generation of instrument-free molecular diagnostics is expected to revolutionize nucleic acid analysis at the POC but also in applications beyond resulting in substantial societal as well as economic benefits.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: DEEPVOLC - Forecasting volcanic activity using deep learning Abstract: DEEPVOLC will radically advance the way future activity is forecast at volcanoes by applying advances in artificial intelligence to transformative new geodetic datasets. 200 million people live within 30 km of a volcano. Accurate forecasting of volcanic eruptions is problematic because 1) it relies on human interpretation at individual volcanoes, 2) a volcano can behave in unexpected ways not previously seen at that location, and 3) most volcanoes are not instrumented. DEEPVOLC will address this by i) applying artificial intelligence, ii) using data for all volcanoes worldwide, and iii) exploiting advances in satellite monitoring. A key indicator of potential volcanic activity is deformation of a volcano's surface due to magma migrating beneath. Surface movements as small as a few millimetres can now be measured from space, using satellite-borne radar. A recently-launched European satellite mission, Sentinel-1, has transformed our ability to measure surface deformation at all of the world's volcanoes, acquiring data at least twice every twelve days. However, forecasting how deforming volcanoes will behave in the future remains challenging. In this project I will apply recently developed deep learning approaches to the satellite data. This is an entirely new approach to forecasting volcanic activity, which currently relies on the individual expertise available at each observatory, and which is only now made possible due to the launch of Sentinel-1 and advances in deep learning algorithms. DEEPVOLC will combine knowledge from all volcanoes that have been active in the era of satellite deformation observations, and will continue to improve as it ingests data from new activity. The main deliverable will be a system for volcano observatories that uses knowledge of how volcanoes behave globally to automatically identify deformation at volcanoes locally, and forecast how the deformation will evolve, indicating the probability of eruption.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"radar":0.9,"satellite radio":0.8,"data networks":0.7,"telecommunications":0.6,"radio technology":0.5,"mobile network":0.4,"telecommunications networks":0.4,"radio frequency":0.3,"optical networks":0.2,"microwave technology":0.2,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"4G":0.1,"5G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile radio":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"teleology":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Service providers and researchers worldwide are sparing no effort to increase the information capacity and security of telecommunication networks to support the demands of high-speed, reliable and secure emerging internet, data centre, cloud computing, 5G new radio and IoT systems, especially since the outbreak of Coronavirus. Applications such as intelligent transportation, signal processing ubiquitous low-latency connectivity and massive connected objects, have raised challenges for backbone and access networks that are often underpinned by optical, radio or hybrid networks. Artificial intelligent (AI) technologies appear an innovative and promising solution to cope with emerging challenges in optical\/wireless\/hybrid networks, in which the underlying physics, mathematics and optimisation of problems are non-deterministic to analyse or impossible to describe explicitly. In this proposed research, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques such as neural networks, clustering and regression will be exploited in optical\/wireless\/hybrid networks to mitigate stochastic distortions, to predict network conditions and to maximise network capacity.

{"text":"Title: selfBACK - A decision support system for self-management of low back pain Abstract: The recent global burden of disease study showed that low back pain (LBP) is the most significant contributor to disability in Europe. Most patients seen in primary care with LBP have non-specific LBP (\u226585%), i.e., pain that cannot reliably be attributed to a specific disease\/pathology. LBP is the fourth most common diagnosis seen in primary care (after upper respiratory infection, hypertension, and coughing). Self-management in the form of physical activity and strength\/stretching exercises constitutes the core component in the management of non-specific LBP; however, adherence to self-management challenging due to lack of feedback and reinforcement. This project aims to develop a decision support system - SELFBACK - that will be used by the patient him\/herself to facilitate, improve and reinforce self-management of LBP. Specifically, SELFBACK will be designed to assist the patient in deciding and reinforcing the appropriate actions to manage own LBP after consulting a health care professional in primary care. The decision support will be conveyed to the patient via a smartphone app in the form of advice for self-management. The advice will be tailored to each patient based on the symptom state, symptom progression, the patients goal-setting, and a range of patient characteristics including information from a physical activity-detecting wristband worn by the patient. The second part of the project will evaluate the effectiveness of SELFBACK in a randomized controlled trial using pain-related disability as primary outcome. We envisage that patients who use SELFBACK will have 20% reduction in pain-related disability at 9 months follow-up compared to patients receiving treatment as usual. Process evaluation will be carried out as an integrated part of the trial to document the implementation and map the patients\u2019 satisfaction with SELFBACK. A business plan with a targeted commercialisation strategy will be developed to transfer the SELFBACK technology into the market.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.8,"WiFi":0.8,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0.8,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: SENTRY - Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Cable Monitoring and Surveying for Offshore Wind Farms providing movement, depth, surface disruption and free-span readings Abstract: Electricity Distribution Services Ltd (EDS) is a global leader in High Voltage (HV) asset management for offshore wind farms.  In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than \u20ac60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector. The financial severity of these incidents continues to grow \u2013 such that they account for 77% of the total global cost of offshore wind farm losses. Our CableSENTRY is an innovative solution based on Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that detects subsea cable faults in real time. Acoustic signals from the HV cable create an optical response in a fibre optic line so faults and other events can be located accurately and immediately on a calibrated system. Applied in addition to existing fault location technology, our solution will be able to identify fault locations in land and subsea HV cables and save an average of 4 days\u2019 downtime per fault over current methods","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.6,"optical networks":0.8,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.9,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

Nevertheless, even nowadays, the medical practice still lacks of systems providing a rapid, reliable and ultra-sensitive sensing in a continuous way. Meanwhile, inflammatory markers consist a pivotal tool in clinical practice since they may be indicators of specific diseases, along with signalising the response of a patient to a specific medical treatment. Nanotechnology-based devices exhibiting memristive electrical properties show great potential for delivering highly scalable, resilient, power efficient and reconfigurable electronic systems. In addition, when those particular nanodevices are subjected to appropriate surface treatments and implemented in the role of bio-inspired sensors, they can bring solutions and introduce novelty to the bio-sensing field regarding highly sensitive and robust detection of biomarkers, while expanding and broadening the research field and applications involving memristive phenomena. In the framework of this fellowship, a flexible, low-cost miniaturised minimally invasive sensing platform will be developed, implementing memristive nanoscale devices as intelligent bio-interfaces, allowing reliable, continuous and real-time monitoring of inflammatory markers. This scheme will be accomplished by the fabrication of a memristor-based sensing platform conjugated with a sensing membrane and an accordingly designed binding assay. Validation of the sensing platform for continuous monitoring will be followed by the integration on flexible substrates for in vivo measurements and integration with readout circuitry enabling the sensing data readout and the wireless transmission to a tablet or smartphone.

For example, the city of Rome\u2019s 3million inhabitants are serviced by 65,000km of buried pipes and cables. Due to this congestion, delivery of vital utilities through the installation and maintenance of new and existing underground services is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous. The personnel working in the various utilities sectors (telecoms, water, gas, electricity etc.) face daily challenges with regard safe excavation for installation and maintenance.\n\nWith limited utility detection solutions available on the market and the general absence of accurate underground piping and cabling records, accidents and damage to these utilities is occurring on a large scale. Maintenance contractors are causing 90,000 incidences of third party damage to EU gas pipelines alone annually. In a North American study, it was found that 25% of incidences are due to insufficient locating practice. The impact of such damage is wide-ranging; approximately 120 deaths and 6,000 serious injuries are attributed to contact with the electricity network occur in Europe every year, while repair costs for damaged services can run into many millions of euros.\n\nThe above problem demands urgent action.

{"text":"Title: TEQ - Testing the Large-Scale Limit of Quantum Mechanics Abstract: Microscopic systems can be prepared in quantum configurations with no classical counterpart. Such a possibility seems precluded when the 'complexity' of the system grows towards the macroscopic domain: so far we have no evidence of non-classical behavior of the macroscopic world. Why is it so? How is quantumness lost as we abandon the microscopic domain? These questions, which remain to date largely unanswered, address interesting and challenging goals of modern research in physics, and serve the overarching goal of this project. TEQ will establish the large-scale limit of quantum mechanics by pursuing a novel research programme that aims at surpassing the current approach based on matter-wave interferometry. Specifically, the TEQ Consortium will\n1) Trap an ad hoc manufactured nanocrystal in a radio-frequency ion trap, cooling it by optical parametric feedback, so as to let it operate in ultra-low noise environments. \n2) Determine quantitatively all the major sources of decoherence affecting the nanocrystal, and control them experimentally so as to prepare high-quality quantum states of its motional degrees of freedom. \n3) Analyse the light scattered by the nanocrystal to test the quantum predictions for the motion of the particle against those of spontaneous collapse and non-standard decoherence mechanisms, and thus pinpoint\/rule-out key quantum-spoiling effects, beyond all the studies performed so far.\nThis roadmap will enable the test of quantum effects for systems whose mass is orders of magnitude larger than that employed in the most successful quantum experiments to date, thus closing the gap with the macroscopic world. Moreover, it will entail significant technological impact: the device that will be built will exhibit exquisite sensitivity to frequency and displacements, thus embodying a significant contribution of explicit technological nature to the design of quantum empowered metrological sensors.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0.0,"telecommunications":0.0,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0.0,"mobile phones":0.0,"bluetooth":0.0,"WiFi":0.0,"data networks":0.0,"optical networks":0.0,"microwave technology":0.6,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.0,"4G":0.0,"LiFi":0.0,"mobile network":0.0,"radio and television":0.0,"satellite radio":0.0,"telecommunications networks":0.0,"5G":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

The confluence of D4FLY set of tools and systems will improve the quality of verification and reduce major time sinks in the processes thus enabling real on-the-move border crossing experience for travelers. Novel sensor hardware based on advanced lightfield cameras and novel algorithms developed in the project will enhance verification accuracy and robustness via the combined usage of 2D+thermal face, 3D face, iris and somatotype biometrics. Analytical means to identify known criminals based on somatotype and 3D face data generated from mugshots and observation data will be developed. Various operational needs of end-users with different threat landscapes constitute the backbone of D4FLY development efforts. D4FLY will create a resilient document verification system that can verify a multitude of physical and electronic security features (e.g. Kinegrams\u00ae, MLIs, CLIs), detect complex forms of electronic fraud and advanced morphing, and identify fraud in breeder documents. The potential benefit of blockchain technology in identity verification will also be investigated. The D4FLY solution will consist of a border control kiosk geared with enhanced enrolment, verification and detection capabilities; smartphones applications for improved performance and verification capabilities; and a non-stop on-the-move system for biometric verification.

{"text":"Title: eBORDER - Secure and Wireless Multimodal Biometric Scanning Device for Passenger Verification Targeting Land and Sea Border Control Abstract: Every year a large number of visitors enter the European Union (EU) by cars, buses, trains or ships through land-border crossing points or sea ports bringing significant economic benefits; in particular, 9% of Europe\u2019s GDP comes from tourism. This trend is set to continue, as Europe further considers visa liberalization agreements in a bid to sustain their competitive stance in the global tourism market. This will create major implications on the security and border management in the EU, as well as diminishing the Quality of Experience for passenger travel.  \nExisting directives for controlling border crossing is to conduct checks using biometric data in conjunction with VIS (Visa Information Systems), as specified in the Schengen Border Code. However, current biometric systems rely on one mode of biometric data, that can at times can lead to false identification, in particular under uncontrolled conditions during live sample acquisition. Moreover, the current crop of scanning devices are limited in coverage and typically have fixed links, thus confining the range of border control applications and compromising the comfort of passengers. We aim to go beyond and propose an innovative passenger-centric biometric system that authenticates \u201con the fly\u201d. We combine the scientific field of wireless security, biometric recognition and data fusion to develop a  secure and wireless multimodal biometric scanning device for passenger verification targeting land and sea border control applications. \nThe research approach is the basis for a RISE training action that we refer to as eBORDER, that is foreseen to enhance both the career potential of staff members and innovation capacity at the institutional level.

The production process, often the products, the supply chains, and the communication with end users.\nThe digital world calls for fast and cross-border re-use of creative content in different contexts, at different levels of granularity, for different purposes.\nHowever there is a dark lacuna when it comes to the digital content value network \u2013 everything is digital except the actual functioning of the rights supply chains to enable such re-use. When users wish to re-use content, it is very hard to find information on who to ask for permission, which licenses are available, and on which terms and conditions.\nThis is where the ARDITO project comes into play. The project vision is that any user should be able easily to access such rights information. To obtain this, we need a Rights Data Network (RDN), a network of connected e-infrastructures to automate the exchange of information about rights. We do not start from scratch. The Linked Content Coalition initiative has defined the framework. The RDI project has demonstrated how such RDN could implement the LCC framework; and the Copyright Hub has provided a first implementation of such principles.\nThe time to go live with actual services is now. A group of SMEs, well established in different creative sectors (books, audio-visual and images), a research centre and the Copyright Hub Foundation decided to promote the ARDITO idea to accelerate the development of the RDN, through optimising a range of content identification technologies (watermarks, content recognition, DOIs) for use in the RDN, integrating them into the Copyright Hub ecosystem, and developing new services, ready to bring to the market.\nThe services are varied but share the same vision: to be an access point to the RDN offered to different markets.

{"text":"Title: BE-OI - Beyond EPICA - Oldest Ice Abstract: To better constrain the response of Earth\u2019s climate system to continuing emissions, it is essential to turn to the past. A key advance would be to understand the transition in Earth\u2019s climate response to changes in orbital forcing during the 'mid-Pleistocene transition' (900 to 1200 thousand years ago) and in particular the role of greenhouse gases. Unravelling such key linkages between the carbon cycle, ice sheets, atmosphere and ocean behaviour is vital for society to better design effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Only ice cores contain the unique and quantitative information about past climate forcing and atmospheric responses.

{"text":"Title: SCOPE - Surface-COnfined fast-modulated Plasma for process and Energy intensification in small molecules conversion Abstract: The SCOPE project will introduce a ground-breaking approach to use renewable energy in three major industrial reactions: 1) N2 fixation, 2) CH4 valorization and 3) CO2 conversion to liquid solar fuels. We will use non-thermal plasma, which has large potential to convert these small (low reactive) molecules under near ambient temperature and pressure, particularly for distributed processes based on renewable energy. The new processes have drastically lower carbon footprint (up to over 90% with respect to current ones). Furthermore, CO2 conversion is crucial for a world-based distribution of renewable energy. However, the selectivity and energy efficiency of plasma technologies for these reactions are too low, making radically new approaches necessary. \n\nThe Project idea is to realize a highly innovative approach for non-thermal plasma symbiosis with catalysis. By inducing excited states in solid catalysts to work in synergy with the excited short-lived plasma species, we introduce a brand new idea for catalyst-plasma symbiosis. In addition, we introduce a fully new concept of nano-\/micro-plasma array through a novel electrode design, to generate the plasma at the catalyst surface, thereby overcoming long distance transport. By embedding ferro-magnetic nano-domains in the catalyst support and inducing radiofrequency heating, we create fast temperature modulations directly at the catalyst active sites. Combining these elements, the project will overcome the actual limits and enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency to levels suitable for exploitation. This requires a synergy over different scale elements: nano at catalyst, micro at the level of modelling plasma generated species, milli at the reactor scale and mega at the plant level for sustainability-driven opportunity guidance and impact assessment by Life-Cycle-Assessment. The synergy value derives from the integration of the PI competencies over this entire dimensional-scale level.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.6,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: iMETland - iMETland: A new generation of Microbial Electrochemical Wetland for effective decentralized wastewater treatment Abstract: iMETland project aims to construct and validate a full-scale application of a eco-friendly device to treat urban wastewater from small communities at zero-energy operation cost. Our concept comes from the integration of Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (MET) with the biofilters used in constructed wetlands. iMETland outperforms classical biofilters from constructed wetlands by using electroactive bacteria in combination with a innovative electroconductive material to achive depuration rates that are 10-fold higher than classical techniques. On top of that, the low biomass yield generated under electrogenic conditions avoids any bed colmatation. Wastewater will be also converted into pathogen-free water suitable for irrigation by using an electro-oxidative methodology. Furthermore, the unique conversion of sewage treatment into electric current by electricity-producing bacteria makes such a process an internal reporter of the biological depuration process. So thus, it can be used as output signal to control the process and can easily inform the operator through ICT tools, converting the depuration in an interactive process between device and a smart-phone in end-user\u00b4s hands.\niMETland try to fill the gap that was sharply identified by the programme topic: WATER-1-2014\/2015: Bridging the gap: from innovative water solutions to market replication.

The aim is to combine an intellectual challenge in understanding the contemporary nature of age and the impact of new media, with an applied challenge to use this knowledge to help make mHealth a more effective intervention. \nThrough simultaneous 15 month ethnographies in China, Japan, Iran, Ireland, Nigeria and Tanzania (and supplementary work in Trinidad) a team will explore the experience of age for those between 45-70 i.e. neither clearly young nor elderly, who represent an unprecedented population that has resulted from changed life expectancy and changed aspirations. We will examine how this shift in the experience of age is impacted by the rise of smartphones that bring access to technologies associated with the young. mHealth started with youth orientated issues of fitness and wellbeing but is increasingly becoming a significant intervention in helping older populations deal with disease and frailties. mHealth has potential both for helping those with low access to professional care but also threatens to bypass and undermine professional medical services. Our aim is to complement technology led mHealth interventions with ethnography led participatory design, consisting of a collaboration between mHealth professionals with our ethnographically informed team and our informants.\nThe applied anthropology will inform our intellectual advances in the field of digital anthropology. Reflections on mHealth will contribute to the core aim of advancing our understanding of the experience of age in this new interstitial period of life, and to appreciate the major transformations in society and sociality represented by the new ubiquity of the smartphone.

{"text":"Title: Pearls Constellation - A next generation telecommunication platform based on a nano-satellites constellation Abstract: Despite broad expansion of mobile networks, coverage gaps remain due to a lack of ICT infrastructure: 0.72bn people globally still lack access to basic voice and text services, with around 3.9bn (53% of the world\u2019s population) lacking access to the internet at 3G speeds. The majority of these uncovered populations are low income and live in rural regions of Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Current solutions for communication service in rural areas are based on large communication satellites (3,000 kg), leading to lengthy and costly development, as well as high costs of production, launch and operation. The central challenge in reaching uncovered communities is overcoming the unfavorable cost- benefit equation related to installing an operative communication infrastructure (with launch, maintenance and operating costs), whilst providing reliable and affordable communication. \nWith a sophisticated and revolutionary telecommunication network infrastructure leveraging nanosatellite technology, the Pearls constellation of 200 nano-satellites will provide affordable and reliable communication services anywhere within the Equatorial band. An advanced space technology, combined with a complex software infrastructure, provides a robust satellite communication platform that can be accessed at a low price and from any commercial cell phone. SAS\u2019s goal is to provide affordable communication services and coverage to billions of people living along the equator who currently have no access to simple communication service. \nDuring the feasibility assessment, a detailed scale-up plan to the constellation of 200 nano-satellites will be set up, and a supply chain will be established, as well as plan for the launch of 200 nano-satellites will be drafted.  During the second phase of project, SAS will upgrade the software, scale-up the control and management platform, and will launch 5 nano-satellites in Space.","gt":["mobile network","mobile phones"],"preds":{"telecommunications":0.9,"mobile phones":0.8,"data networks":0.7,"satellite radio":0.6,"radio technology":0.5,"mobile network":0.4,"telecommunications networks":0.4,"radio frequency":0.3,"microwave technology":0.2,"radio and television":0.1,"4G":0.1,"5G":0.1,"WiFi":0,"LiFi":0,"optical networks":0,"radar":0,"teleology":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: PAINLESS - energy-autonomous Portable Access points for INfrastructure-LESS networks Abstract: The explosive growth of applications and industrial sectors that rely on broadband connectivity, is set to stretch the demand for wireless networks beyond the reach of the power grid infrastructure. Access points are being deployed on board of drones, while more than 84,000 hybrid-energy base stations are expected to be deployed annually in remote areas by 2020. Portable network nodes that are energy-autonomous and operate detached from the power grid will become indispensable in the coming applications of wireless networks. Energy-autonomy presents immense challenges for the wireless network design and imposes a complete re-think of technological solutions. PAINLESS has the visionary aim to establish a training and research platform to pioneer green, energy-autonomous portable network nodes which are self-subsistent and limitlessly-scalable, to satisfy future demands with minimal infrastructure. It promises a paradigm shift by integrating and jointly optimising wireless networks with renewable energy sources, radiated energy harvesting and airborne access points, as well as establishing disruptive performance benchmarks for the combined wireless power-and-information distribution. Our results will kick-start an innovation ecosystem for infrastructure and service providers of ICT to develop and commercialise a new generation of autonomous, sustainable and power-independent communication networks with self-organising functionality, to enable 100% coverage in urban environments in a power-efficient manner; provide network access to all types of emergency, disaster and special events areas; and connect remote \/ developing areas with problematic infrastructure. PAINLESS relates to H2020-MSCA with a vision to produce the first generation of experts in a radically new wave of energy autonomous networks that will revolutionise the wireless networking technology landscape and the plethora of associated vertical business sectors.","gt":["radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.6,"bluetooth":0.2,"WiFi":0.7,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.4,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.6,"4G":0.3,"LiFi":0.2,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.4,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}
{"text":"Title: NoHoW - Evidence-based ICT tools for weight loss maintenance Abstract: Most adults who try to lose weight fail to maintain it. Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.\n\nImpact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK\u2019s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000+ consumers. Commercialisation of project results will provide much needed WLM services that promote health education and long-term weight management programmes.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.8,"WiFi":0.8,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0.8,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: AdMiRe - Advanced Mixed Realities Abstract: The main goal of AdMiRe is to develop, validate and demonstrate innovation solutions, based on Mixed Reality (MR) technology, which will allow for TV audiences a step change in interactivity, and bring for content creators a radical improvement in talent immersion and interaction with computer generated elements. AdMiRe is focused on sectors where the lead industry partners in the consortium are key players, thus guaranteeing the impact of the innovation and the take up of the technology. \nAt present, TV audiences can interact with the shows they are watching only through social media or HBBTV. Comments, video and audio from the audience may be incorporated into TV program formats, but this is done in such a way that viewer engagement is quite limited and there is not much potential for innovation. AdMiRe will radically change this by producing solutions that will allow viewers at home to be incorporated into the live TV program they are watching and to interact with people in the TV studio. The key innovation here is to use a regular mobile phone to capture the viewer, extract him\/her from the background and finally composite the viewer into the studio footage as an MR object. \nAs for content creators, be it in film, TV or live productions, there is an ever growing trend to combine actors and performers with computer generated objects and have them interact. But the number and difficulty of the technical challenges involved have resulted in methods and technologies of reduced scope, resulting in less engaging content. AdMiRe takes the exact opposite approach, producing authoring tools that remove the main technological obstacles and that will allow actors to be immersed in virtual environments, performers to feel at home within the space, and directors to have the opportunity to better capture emotion, all in all resulting in the possibility to create more compelling visuals and more engaging programming.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.6,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.5,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0.9,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.5,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Access networks are essential part of the communication infrastructure as bridge between end-users and core networks. Their design must make possible the provision of real-time high-bandwidth access to Internet, essential for advanced communication services as immersive video and ubiquitous cloud computing. It is clearly foreseen that the only long-term solution to the problem involves optical fiber as transmission medium, the so called optical access networks. Passive optical network (PON) is the most widely employed technology because of the cost reduction it entails, but the capacity of actual time-division multiplexed PONs will be exhausted eventually as more bandwidth-hungry applications become available in the near future. Telecommunications carriers face the challenge of meeting the unprecedented bandwidth demand by end users at the same time the capital and operating expenditures requirements are reduced.\nINVENTION project targets the development of cost-effective and high capacity communication architectures for their employment on optical access\/metro networks. The proposed concept will be based on the employment of coherent detection with low-cost and simplified optical receiver architectures, making sure that the proposed approaches meet the cost requirements of these optical networks. The proposed concepts will be implemented by a suitable combination of optical signal processing techniques and digital-signal-processing (DSP) algorithms, keeping the required DSP at realizable levels.

{"text":"Title: HQSTS - High-Quality voice model for STatistical parametric speech Synthesis Abstract: A speech analysis\/synthesis method aims at representing a speech waveform, produced by a person speaking, as a time sequence of parameters. Based on this time sequence, the speech waveform can be resynthesized. The analysis\/synthesis methods are cornerstones for many speech technologies (e.g. text-to-speech, telecommunications, voice restoration). For the majority of applications, these methods need to have two key properties: (i) a high perceived quality of the speech sound, and, (ii) a statistical characterization of the parameters' sequence necessary for statistical approaches, which have attracted great interest during the last decades in speech technologies. The current analysis\/synthesis methods that provide a statistical characterization exhibit however a lack of perceived quality. This issue does not pose a problem in applications designed for noisy environments (e.g. navigation devices, smart-phone applications, announcements in train stations). On the contrary, it prohibits the use of statistical approaches in quiet environments, e.g. in the music, cinema and video game industries, where the listener is fully aware of all the details of the sound. This problem is mainly due to the lack of an accurate representation of the phase information and its correlation with the amplitude information. Indeed, recent phase processing tools allowed the description of the phase spectrum properties in a way that shows the drawbacks and limits of current analysis\/synthesis methods. Additionally, these same tools are also promising means for modeling the phase information, which is paramount for good quality. The primary goal of the HQSTS project is to create a high-quality analysis\/synthesis method that will broaden the applications of statistical approaches of speech technologies in quiet environments, where a high-quality is an absolute necessity.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.6,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.4,"mobile radio":0.6,"4G":0.4,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.6,"radio and television":0.4,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.4,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

The positive association between the rise in consumption of food prepared outside the home and the increasing prevalence of obesity has been described as a major health and wellbeing societal challenge. Attempts to increase public awareness of appropriate ways to eat more healthily unfortunately do not seem to have led to significant changes in patterns of food purchase and consumption especially from an eating \u2018out-of-home\u2019 situation. It has become obvious that the development of effective measures for improvement requires further systematic research and a radical approach. The aim of FoodSMART is to develop an innovative technical (ICT) menu solution that enables informed consumer choice when eating out that takes into account individual characteristics (such as culture, dietary requirements and age group) as well as product (specification) and environmental cues (choice architecture and consumption setting). \nThis aim will be achieved through the evaluation of consumer orientated intelligence (what information consumers require\/trust i.e. information quality); the assessment of industry orientated intelligence (impact of customisation) and the subsequent development of data analytics and Quick Recognition (QR) coding for personalised food recommendation; thereby, facilitating the consumption of healthy and appropriate dishes. Results will be gathered and modelled to provide strategic intelligence for menu design and decision-making (by Industry) and for policy purposes (by the EU); further, this translational research will be disseminated both at scientific and consumer levels.

{"text":"Title: FoodSmartphone - Smartphone analyzers for on-site testing of food quality and safety Abstract: Current food quality and safety testing is, to a large extent, an inefficient, expensive and ineffective process, unable to assure food safety for all consumers and unable to prevent major food fraud incidents. A paradigm shift in quality and safety testing is urgently required in order to free resources for an intensified combat against fraud in the food chain. As an enabling technology solution, the FoodSmartphone ETN proposes the development of smartphone-based (bio)analytical sensing and diagnostics tools for simplified on-site rapid pre-screening of food quality and safety parameters and wireless data transfer to servers of relevant stakeholders. FoodSmartphone comprises 7 Training Sites (3 universities, 3 research centres, 1 innovation SME), plus 5 Partner Organisations (1 global food industry, 1 diagnostics SME and 3 universities awarding doctoral degrees). The consortium has been built upon highly complementary disciplines: (bio)analytical chemists, biologists, physicists, micro-engineers, mathematicians and food chemists will work together on the joint supra-disciplinary goal. FoodSmartphone provides a unique mix of exciting local PhD research covering all aspects of smartphone-based screening tools plus a wealth of network-wide science & innovation and transferable skills training: the ETN provides more than 14 network-wide and transferable skills training events and 16 optional- and 11 mandatory intersectoral secondment opportunities. The ETN and results thereof will be widely disseminated to key stakeholders, embedded in continuous education programs and translated into a final exploitation plan. Scientific awareness of the next generation and public engagement will be boosted by several well-targeted outreach activities. The scientific training in novel smartphone-based sensing technologies plus the complementary skills training provided will have a major impact on future EU monitoring practices and, moreover, pave the road for Citizen Science approaches to food quality and safety testing.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"mobile phones":0.9,"telecommunications":0.8,"data networks":0.7,"mobile network":0.6,"radio technology":0.5,"mobile radio":0.4,"4G":0.3,"5G":0.2,"teleology":0.0,"radio frequency":0.0,"radar":0.0,"bluetooth":0.0,"WiFi":0.0,"optical networks":0.0,"microwave technology":0.0,"satellite radio":0.0,"radio and television":0.0,"LiFi":0.0,"telecommunications networks":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

SKEM\u2019s technology enables the low temperature processing of high performance transistors onto plastic for the first time. This allows mechanical flexibility to be combined with electronic performance previously only demonstrated by rigid inorganics, along with significant reductions to processing costs.\nThis will enable SKEM\u2019s customers to produce entirely new form factors for display-based consumer electronics: flexible, body conforming, lightweight, unbreakable devices with high resolution and low power consumption (longer battery lifetimes). This can be achieved with low risk to adoption, using refitted standard production lines. As a universal transistor platform, SKEM will supply the existing market for liquid crystal displays (LCDs), while also facilitating the new market for organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.\nThe project will involve customer engagement (customers are already engaged in joint development work, showing commitment with signed Letters of Intent) and commercial planning (WP2), development of the technology platform to meet customer requirements (WP3), demonstration of the technology in full display devices (WP4) and preparation for commercial roll out, involving technology transfer to industrial process lines, and scale-up of truFLEX production (WP5). A strong regime of project management (WP1) dissemination and communication (WP6) will support the aims of the project. These developments will elevate the technology from initial demonstration in the relevant industrial application (TRL6 - first LCD demonstrator completed prior to project), to full commercial readiness after the project (TRL9).

{"text":"Title: ARIA-VALUSPA - Artificial Retrieval of Information Assistants - Virtual Agents with Linguistic Understanding, Social skills, and Personalised Aspects Abstract: The ARIA-VALUSPA project will create a ground-breaking new framework that will allow easy creation of Artificial Retrieval of Information Assistants (ARIAs) that are capable of holding multi-modal social interactions in challenging and unexpected situations. The system can generate search queries and return the information requested by interacting with humans through virtual characters. These virtual humans will be able to sustain an interaction with a user for some time, and react appropriately to the user's verbal and non-verbal behaviour when presenting the requested information and refining search results. Using audio and video signals as input, both verbal and non-verbal components of human communication are captured. Together with a rich and realistic emotive personality model, a sophisticated dialogue management system decides how to respond to a user's input, be it a spoken sentence, a head nod, or a smile. The ARIA uses special speech synthesisers to create emotionally coloured speech and a fully expressive 3D face to create the chosen response. Back-channelling, indicating that the ARIA understood what the user meant, or returning a smile are but a few of the many ways in which it can employ emotionally coloured social signals to improve communication.  \nAs part of the project, the consortium will develop two specific implementations of ARIAs for two different industrial applications.

However, they do not provide support for early mood assessment or psychological treatment and lack a real-time comprehensive assessment of the patient\u2019s mental status. \nDepression is the third leading contributor to global diseases, and depressive mood state is also considered to be strictly related to the onset or worsening of a severe primary somatic disease. Indeed effective preventive medicine related to the onset of depressive symptoms as a comorbidity and worsening factor of psychosomatic diseases such as myocardial infarction, leg-amputation, cancer, and kidney failure is lacking. \nNEVERMIND sets out to empower people who suffer from symptoms of depression related to a serious somatic disease by placing them at the center of their mental healthcare. Equipped with just a smartphone and a lightweight sensitized shirt, patients seeking care and treatment for their mental illnesses interact with these devices that collect data about their mental and physical health, to then get effective feedback. Lifestyle factors, i.e. diet, physical activity and sleep hygiene, play a significant mediating role in the development, progression and treatment of depression, and in NEVERMIND will be monitored by a real-time Decision Support System running locally on the patient\u2019s smartphone, predicting the severity and onset of depressive symptoms, by processing physiological data, body movement, speech, and the recurrence of social interactions.

{"text":"Title: FORMOBILE - From mobile phones to court \u2013 A complete FORensic investigation chain targeting MOBILE devices Abstract: Mobile devices, especially smartphones represent a unique challenge for law enforcement. Criminal offenders use phones to communicate, coordinate, organise and execute criminal actions. This is especially true for organised crime and terrorist organisations. This development provides new challenges for criminal prosecution and it is vital to empower law enforcement to access the data stored on mobile devices to use it as court evidence in a trustworthy and reliable manner.  The overarching objective of FORMOBILE is to establish a complete end to end forensic investigation chain, targeting for mobile devices. To achieve this goal three objectives will be pursued. Novel tools shall be developed that include the acquisition of previously unavailable mobile data, unlocking mobile devices, as well as the decoding and analysis of mobile data. Based on the definition of requirements of law enforcement and legal and ethical issues a new mobile forensics standard shall be developed. With the developments of the new standard and the new tools, training for police and criminal prosecution will be established, providing the end users with the latest knowledge in a novel and an innovative curriculum to ensure a quality standard of investigations.   The European Union has developed as a Security Union, building on the European Agenda on Security. This aims to ensure that people live in an area of freedom, security and justice, without internal frontiers. To strengthen digital forensics in the context of criminal investigations is crucial to achieve this vision. FORMOBILE contributes to the fight against virtually all forms of crime. This is because mobile devices are widely used in crimes, especially in the arrangement of conspiracies. Yet, there are crimes more closely related to mobile devices; this includes child abuse and emerging forms of cybercrime in particular. To fight crime effectively, law enforcement has to be empowered to access all evidence stored on mobile devices.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.8,"WiFi":0.8,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: MENTOR - Machine LEarning in Optical NeTwORks Abstract: Optical fiber networks is one of the major drivers of our societal progress and a key  enabler of the global telecommunication infrastructure. Optical networks underwent considerable changes over the past decade, as consequence of a continuous growth (exceeding 20% per year) of bandwidth demand.   The current growth sets strong requirements in terms of capacity and costs for the operators, which seek to decrease the cost per transmitted bit. Several solutions have been proposed, and among them wide-band is more favourable to network operators, compared to more\/or novel fibers. However, wide-band optical system presents new major challenges: optical components must guarantee similar performance over a broad spectrum, network optimization is carried out on a non-flat spectrum and with a much larger number of channels making design, optimization and control a complex problem. Therefore, application of machine learning (ML) techniques is of the growing importance for high-capacity multi-band (MB) optical systems. ML is becoming the technique of choice to solve complex nonlinear technical problems, such as, advance component design and management of wide-band networks. \n\nThe European Industrial Doctorate MENTOR presents a timely proposal to train 6 ESRs in the interdisciplinary field of high industrial importance: ML applications in multi-band optical communications. As ML can properly works only when a large amount of real data is available, it is crucial to bring together academic partners and the industry that provide access to the data. MENTOR consortium offers the strong industrial commitment of four large companies (CORIANT Germany and Portugal, ORANGE Labs and TELECOM ITALIA MOBILE) that significantly contributed in defining the research and training topics to be studied together with the world-leading academic partners in MENTOR.

{"text":"Title: VICINITY - Open virtual neighbourhood network to connect intelligent buildings and smart objects Abstract: The lack of interoperability is considered as the most important barrier to achieve the global integration of IoT ecosystems across borders of different disciplines, vendors and standards. Indeed, the current IoT landscape consists of a large set of isolated islands that do not constitute a real internet, preventing the exploitation of the huge potential expected by ICT visionaries.\n\nTo overcome this situation, VICINITY presents a virtual neighborhood concept, which is a decentralized, bottom-up and cross-domain approach that resembles a social network, where users can configure their set ups, integrate standards according to the services they want to use and fully control their desired level of privacy. VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services.\n\nVICINITY's approach will be demonstrated by a large-scale demonstration connecting 8 facilities in 7 different countries. The demonstration covers various domains including energy, building automation, health and transport. VICINITY's potential to create new, domain-crossing services will be demonstrated by value added services such as micro-trading of DSM capabilities, AI-driven optimization of smart urban districts and business intelligence over IoT.\n\nOpen calls are envisioned in the project to integrate further, preferably public, IoT infrastructures and to deploy additional added value services. This will not only extend the scale of VICINITY demonstration, but also efficiently raise the awareness of industrial communities of VICINITY and its capabilities.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: PACIFIC - Passive seismic techniques for environmentally friendly and cost efficient mineral exploration Abstract: \"The PACIFIC consortium will develop a new, low-cost and environmentally friendly tool for exploring for mineral deposits beneath the surface.

Two radically new developments are planned; reflection passive seismics, which is appropriate from greenfields exploration, and the multi-array method, which will typically be deployed during drilling or in brownfields exploration. Both techniques have major advantages over current techniques, namely relatively low cost and minor impact on the environment.

In particular, the IoT offers tremendous socio-economic and environmental benefits through the improved automation and energy efficiency of Smart Homes, Buildings and Industrial Plants.\n\nMost IoT applications demand that devices provide the range of WiFi. In addition, devices must be standards-based, highly secure, globally interoperable, reliable, ultra-low power and cost effective.\n\nHowever, existing IoT technology is failing to meet these market needs. Current 2.4GHz radios have limited range and sub-GHz radios do not give security or global interoperability. \n\nThere are two ways to increase the range of radio devices: 1) increase transmit power or 2) improve the radio\u2019s receiver sensitivity (Rx sensitivity). However, legislation in Europe limits transmit power to 10dBm, meaning the only practical way to increase range is to improve Rx sensitivity. \n\nCascoda has developed a disruptive 2.4GHz wireless transceiver based on a unique patent-protected radio architecture, which significantly improves Rx sensitivity, effectively doubling the range without using any external power amplifiers. This delivers the range of WiFi to provide whole-house coverage, reduces power consumption by a factor of 6 enabling years of operation from batteries, provides high security, reliability and reduces equipment costs by a factor 5 as no power amplifiers are needed. \n\nExtensive R&D and market feasibility studies including a Eureka Eurostars and a H2020 Phase 1 project, have taken us this far. This Phase 2 project will allow us to optimise, refine and certify our products under industry standards and demonstrate our systems under real-world conditions. This project enables us to enter the low-power wireless market worth at least \u20ac3 billion. By 2025, we will cumulatively generate \u20ac48 million in revenues and \u20ac27 million in operating profits and help create up to 184 skilled jobs.","gt":["radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0.9,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

The project will drive the UAV verticals and 5G networks to a win-win position, on one hand by showing that 5G is able to guarantee UAV vertical KPIs, and on the other hand by demonstrating that 5G can support challenging use-cases that put pressure on network resources, such as low-latency and reliable communication, massive number of connections and high bandwidth requirements, simultaneously. 5G!Drones will build on top of the 5G facilities provided by the ICT-17 projects and a number of support sites, while identifying and developing the missing components to trial UAV use-cases. The project will feature Network Slicing as the key component to simultaneously run the three types of UAV services on the same 5G infrastructure (including the RAN, back\/fronthaul, Core), demonstrating that each UAV application runs independently and does not affect the performance of other UAV applications, while covering different 5G services. While considering verticals will be the main users of 5G!Drones, the project will build a software layer to automate the run of trials that exposes a high level API to request the execution of a trial according to the scenario defined by the vertical, while enforcing the trial\u2019s scenario using the API exposed by the 5G facility, as well as the 5G!Drones enablers API deployed at the facility. Thus, 5G!Drones will enable abstracting all the low-level details to run the trials for a vertical and aims at validating 5G KPIs to support several UAV use-cases via trials using a 5G shared infrastructure, showing that 5G supports the performance requirements of UAVs with several simultaneous UAV applications with different characteristics (eMBB, uRLLC and mMTC).

They will be able to overcome the information bottleneck due to wired connections and will lead the semiconductor industry into a new More-Than-Moore era. Designing the architecture of these wireless C2C networks is, however, impossible today based on standard engineering design tools. Efficient modelling strategies for describing noisy electromagnetic fields in complex environments are necessary for developing these new chip architectures and wireless interconnectors. Device modelling and chip optimization procedures need to be based on the underlying physics for determining the electromagnetic fields, the noise models and complex interference pattern. In addition, they need to take into account input signals of modern communication systems being modulated, coded, noisy and eventually disturbed by other signals and thus extremely complex. \nRecent advances both in electrical engineering and mathematical physics make it possible to deliver the breakthroughs necessary to enable this future emerging wireless C2C technology by creating a revolutionary electromagnetic field simulation toolbox. Increasingly sophisticated physical models of wireless interconnects and associated signal processing strategies and new insight into wave modelling in complex environments based on dynamical systems theory and random matrix theory make it possible to envisage wireless communication on a chip level.

{"text":"Title: MicroQC - Microwave driven ion trap quantum computing Abstract: The construction of a large-scale trapped-ion quantum information processor can be made decisively simpler by using the well-developed and compact microwave technology present already in today\u2019s mobile phones and other devices. Microwave technology has tremendous simplification potential by condensing experimental effort from an optical table with several square meters of accurately aligned optical components down to an engineered conductor microstructure embedded into a chip surface and a few off-the-shelve microwave components. Thus, this technology can be the key enabling step for addressing the formidable challenge of a scalable quantum processor. Although the field is still in its infancy, there is rapid progress: a fidelity of over 99.9999% has been achieved for single-qubit gates and 99.7% for two-qubit gates. This technology allows execution of quantum gates by the application of a voltage to a microchip potentially replacing millions of laser beams and it can operate at room temperature or mild cooling. There are still enormous technical challenges in scaling ion trap (or any other) systems up to the millions of qubits required to implement meaningful full-sale quantum computation and simulation. The main objective of MicroQC is to demonstrate, through state-of-art quantum engineering, fast and fault-tolerant microwave two-qubit and multi-qubit gates and to design scalable technology components that apply these techniques in multi-qubit quantum processors. The successful accomplishment of these objectives, in a combined effort by five leading groups in this field \u2013 three experimental groups, including the pioneers in microwave quantum logic with static and oscillating magnetic gradients, and two leading theory groups \u2013 will make large-scale quantum computation and simulation with microwave-controlled microfabricated ion traps possible.

{"text":"Title: SmokeBot - Mobile Robots with Novel Environmental Sensors for Inspection of Disaster Sites with Low Visibility Abstract: SmokeBot is driven by the application needs for robots that operate in domains with restricted visibility. The focus is on civil robots supporting fire brigades in search and rescue missions, e.g. in post-disaster management operations in response to tunnel fires. Existing sensor technology and the related cognitive approaches cannot cope with such demanding conditions. SmokeBot addresses this shortcoming and can thus bring about a step change for robotics. It will deliver software and hardware components which facilitate robot systems to perform under harsh conditions of smoke, dust or fog. This will be demonstrated through integration of the project results in an industrial prototype of a Low Visibility Explorer Robot for providing situational awareness based on a commercial platform from partner TAUR. In close collaboration with TAUR (robotics industry) and end users (FDDO, end users in the advisory group), SmokeBot will crucially improve the abilities of the selected platform, thus increasing safety of rescue staff and European citizens as well as improving the product of a European robotics company in an important market. An even wider impact is expected through the development of a novel sensor unit and the corresponding cognitive approaches. In addition to traditional sensors such as LIDAR and cameras, which are affected by smoke or dust, this sensing unit includes also a novel 3D radar camera, a thermal camera, and high-bandwidth gas sensors. Fusion of sensor modalities will allow the inclusion of measurements from LIDAR and camera into the world model when they occasionally penetrate through e.g. smoke. In addition, we will develop the means to integrate prior knowledge in the form of crude human sketch maps to allow for robust mapping and navigation even under low visibility in a harsh environment.

NPNs can be deployed as independent and standalone 5G networks or in conjunction with a public network.\nTo ensure the successful demonstration of these use cases, the project brings together a set of experienced partners whose expertise covers both 5G and content production value chains. Most of the 5G components will be developed and implemented by a specific key partner, being mostly innovative SMEs. The presence of SMEs is particularly strong in the consortium, since they represent the 44.5%. The 5G-RECORDS implemented technologies will be based on existing 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 specifications, while also prototyping some emerging Rel-17 capabilities. All technology components are expected to reach by the end of the project a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7. 5G-RECORDS has considered 3 use cases to embrace some of the most challenging scenarios in the framework of professional content production: live audio production, a multi-camera wireless studio and live immersive media production.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0.8,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

One explanation for why money does not buy happiness is that individuals often have imprecise expectations about things they buy: imprecise forecasting of the nature, intensity and duration of an affective response derived from a purchase. Current technology enables people to track how money is spent to help take control of one\u2019s personal finance, balancing income and expenses, and achieving financial goals. A similar trend is present in tracking of emotional well-being of people through novel wearable sensors emerging from the Quantified Self movement. This project harnesses these unique and timely developments in improving the positive impact wealth can have on happiness. We will improve the accuracy of affective forecasts about future purchases by keeping history of emotional states and associated spending, performing prediction analytics based on the collected data, and providing feedback about anticipated affective value of the purchases.

{"text":"Title: COIN - Coding for Optical communications In the Nonlinear regime Abstract: The rapid increase in data traffic in the past years and traffic forecasts will lead to capacity exhaust in the optical fibre communications infrastructure which carries over 95% of all data services. The optical fibre channel is nonlinear, that is, its properties, namely its refractive index, is dependent on optical intensity, and at high power densities, the combination of nonlinear effects and dispersion leads to nonlinear distortion, limiting both achievable capacities, spectral efficiencies and distances. A key research area requiring investigation is nonlinear coding and detection, tailored to the nonlinear channel to dramatically improve the data throughput of future optical networks. New R&D is critically needed not only for finding new native nonlinear communication techniques but also transferring them into practical, error-resilient systems. The COIN objective is, thus, the development of a new area of nonlinear communications including forward error correction, essential for reliable communication. Specifically, COIN will investigate the application of nonlinear Fourier transforms and nonlinearity-tailored coding and detection by effectively integrating the scientific expertise of the key academic research groups in information theory, coding, coherent optical communication and high-speed transmission with the industrial know-how of the consortium. The COIN R&D goals will be to focus on the development of new, native communication schemes and waveforms alongside with the development of coding schemes for these and existing non-linear Fourier transform based transceivers. The R&D tasks will be carried out along with researcher training in the leading scientific centres in Europe.

{"text":"Title: ACTING-NOW - Algorithmic Containment of Threats in Graphs, Networks or Webs Abstract: The project is about the security of networks, and how to select the best containing actions to perform when a network is threatened. Network security is a major concern for Europe in the guise of at least three threats: attacks on computer networks and related infrastructure; diseases spreading in networks consisting of people, livestock, crops or wildlife; and the spread of fires in forests or buildings. The project brings together an experienced researcher with a successful track record in \u201cthe firefighter problem\u201d (which models the general network security problem), a supervisor with complementary expertise and world-leading research record in multi-objective optimization, a host organization with expertise and leading research groups in (i) Security, (ii) Randomized, heuristic optimization (from theory to industrial exploitation) and (iii) Human-Computer Interaction. Two non-academic secondment partners strengthen this team still further, bringing in industry-scale optimization experience (Noesis Solutions), and a long track record of advising for fire safety to major infrastructure projects including to the military (Lee Anderson). The experienced researcher will use the training and mobility afforded by this complementary partnership to further the impact of his research on European security, benefit from skills training in industrial exploitation and on offering policy advice, and learn a range of additional academic and non-academic skills from participating in the training of young researchers. Scientific results of the project include new, effective computational methods achieving better results in practical applications mentioned above. Theoretical understanding of spreading emergencies in graphs will be useful in fundamental research in other fields, for example, in medicine in research aimed at utilizing the knowledge about contacts in the population for understanding how disease traits (such as the transmission rate and the infectious period) evolve.","gt":["telecommunications networks"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.6,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0.5,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0.4,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: RAPID - Heterogeneous Secure Multi-level Remote Acceleration Service for Low-Power Integrated Systems and Devices Abstract: Many low-power devices such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks as well as several other embedded systems can't always cope with the increased demand for processing power, memory and storage required by modern applications in gaming, vision, security, robotics, aerospace, etc. As a result, most such applications are only executed on high-end servers.\n\nRAPID tackles this challenge by taking advantage of high-performance accelerators and high-bandwidth networks. Following our approach, compute or storage intensive tasks are seamlessly offloaded from the low-power devices to more powerful heterogeneous accelerators, supporting multiple virtual CPUs and GPUs. We propose, for the first time, a secure unified model where almost any device or infrastructure, ranging from smartphone, notebook, laptop and desktop to private and public cloud can operate as an accelerated entity and\/or as an accelerator serving other less powerful devices in a secure way.\n\nRAPID offers a registration mechanism, which permits the accelerated entities to automatically find and connect to nearby accelerators with the required resources. Next, a runtime system, running on each such accelerated entity, takes into account several parameters such as the local status, the environmental conditions, the task requirements, and the status of the accelerators it is connected to in order to decide whether local tasks (or incoming tasks if the entity also acts as an accelerator) should be executed locally or remotely. Novel scheduling algorithms, admission control policies, Service Level Agreements and license policies are employed to serve multiple accelerated applications efficiently on heterogeneous cloud infrastructures.\n\nAn easy-to-use task-based programming model will be defined, while a novel runtime will automatically offload and execute the tasks transparently to the programmer. Within the RAPID project the first public acceleration cloud service will become available and commercially exploitable.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0.7,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0.6,"4G":0.5,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.6,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: MARCONI - Multimedia and Augmented Radio Creation: Online, iNteractive, Individual Abstract: Nowadays, radio shows surpass linear broadcast feeds by increasingly revolving around user engagement, which encompasses audience interaction and experience personalisation. Indeed, a typical consumer increasingly interacts with the radio station through digital platforms and social media. Unfortunately, the tools to enable radio-makers to capitalize on these new kinds of media and interaction opportunities are premature at best, and are in addition ill-aligned with contemporary radio production workflows.\n\nMARCONI aims to bring radio experiences to the next level, enabling radio to safeguard its strong position in the European media market, while at the same time facilitating innovative ways of radio making. The goal is to enable fully interactive and personalised radio solutions, integrating broadcast radio with digital and social media, amounting to converged radio experiences. To realize this goal, MARCONI will pursue two concrete objectives. First, consumers will be able to interact with \u201clive\u201d radio through their preferred communication channel in ways that are richer than is feasible today, so that consumers feel more connected to the radio brand -even when not listening linearly- and better served in an individual way. Second, radio-makers will be given an integrated view on audience interactions and will be supported by interaction automation services. The net outcome will be enhanced audience engagement.\n\nMARCONI brings together a multi-disciplinary consortium to realize its vision. Several partners will focus on AI to automate processing of audio-visuals, text and social media posts. A radio redaction solutions provider is represented in the consortium to guarantee smooth integration in real operational workflows. MARCONI also includes broadcasters which will organise large-scale pilots with their respective communities. Finally, strong industry participation (SMEs and radio stations) ensures that the MARCONI market potential will be properly exploited.","gt":["radio and television","telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.6,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0.2,"WiFi":0.3,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.2,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0.8,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.2,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: iCIRRUS - intelligent Converged network consolIdating Radio and optical access aRound USer equipment. Abstract: To meet the high throughput demands envisaged for 5G networks, with increased user densification and bandwidth-hungry applications, while at the same time reducing energy consumption, iCIRRUS proposes an intelligent Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) that brings together optical fibre technology, low-cost but highly flexible Ethernet networking, wireless resource management for device-to-device (D2D) communication (incl. the use of mm-wave spectrum) and the use of virtual mobiles in the cloud. The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul\/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb\/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure. Finally, the intelligent network functions in ICIRRUS can interact with mobile cloud processing, and further offloads of infrastructure communications can be realised through virtualising mobiles in the cloud as clones, and performing communication tasks between clones.","gt":["5G","radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0.8,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.9,"cognitive radio":0.1,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}
{"text":"Title: PABLO - Power Amplifier Design Through Behavioural Modelling Abstract: 5G base-stations will make use of large antenna arrays (hundreds of elements), potentially with each radiating element fed independently, meaning 1 power amplifier (PA) per element. This situation, combined with the trend of removing the circulator from the PA output for cost and size reasons, the design of the PA needs to take into account for the interaction with the other array elements. As a consequence, the simulation in CAD using traditional transistor models with a large number of internal nodes could become inconvenient, and the use of a behavioral model for the transistor could be an interesting choice.\n\nThe project objective is to design 5G RF Doherty PAs for the 5G sub- 6 GHz band using transistor behavioral model. The Cardiff Model will be applied for the first time in a Doherty design, guiding the necessary model changes not only to adapt the model to this application, but also exploiting the advantages that the model can give. Moreover, thanks to his knowledge of Doherty, Jorge will identify a procedure to minimize the number of measurements needed to extract the model. In this way, Jorge will enhance his knowledge by working on behavioral modelling (model extraction, implementation in CAD, and modifications) and waveform measurements. CHFE will improve his range of expertise by hosting a design expert and developing the model for a timely and actual application.\n\nThis research program is framed in one of the EU2020 targets, which is the efficient use of energy, as an important issue related to the climate change and energy sustainability of the world.  The expansion and increasing pervasiveness of wireless networks has significantly increased the impact of their power consumption.

{"text":"Title: Loc8torHC - A disruptive healthcare monitoring solution that by nature of what and how it monitors (IoT) improves home safety, user wellbeing and provides early warning to help avoid critical admissions Abstract: Caring of ageing population will be one of the greatest challenges during this century. Most elderly people want to remain independent in their own homes for as long as possible. This decision can cause their children to worry about their parents\u2019 wellbeing. This is when technology enabled care services (TECS), such as telecare and telehealth, provides a solution. TECS revenues in the EU28+2 countries reached an estimated \u20ac1.89 billion in 2013. \n\nTo cope with this demand, next-generation telecare and tele-health platforms need to be enriched with innovative products. However, current monitoring devices for the elderly, can be divided into two types. The first is nothing more than a panic button connected to a 24-hour emergency telephone operator. It does little, costs a lot, and results in a lot of false alarms. The second kind is an incredibly complex, medical device that is beyond most seniors\u2019 (and carers\u2019) understanding which prevents mass market adoption. \n\nLoc8tor HealthCare (Loc8torHC), a disruptive, cost effective, scalable TECS platform targeted at the retail market. The core platform will be simple and work out of the box with no installation. Meanwhile, the carer can go online and configure the type of information they want the platform to send them, how often they want to receive updates, and whether they want updates in an e-mail, text message, or some other format.\n\nThe core product will include 6 core services; location, wander, fall, panic, activity and temperature in one device. Our competitive advantage is that our platform can easily be configured for numerous applications by adding 3rd party devices (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) through a plug and play Bluetooth port. The data collected from the medical sensors, combined with daily activity patterns (core Loc8torHC tags), and any other data sources (weather, pollution etc.) will be processed through our algorithm to generate a recommended diagnostic output in real time.","gt":["bluetooth"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0.8,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

The European Parliament has called for investment in high quality, innovative technology research to improve dementia care but so far there has been little benefit because research has generally been limited, small scale and methodologically flawed. In particular: the poor understanding between research and business of how people with dementia use technology means new applications are designed without an in-depth appreciation of people\u2019s needs, preferences and limitations; there is little knowledge about practical, psychological and social barriers and facilitators to implementation making it hard to get results into practice; there is a serious shortage of research trained professionals who combine expertise on dementia care research and technology. In conjunction with INTERDEM the world\u2019s largest network of psychosocial research for people with dementia this ITN will: develop a European multi-disciplinary, intersectoral educational research framework for Europe, to comprehensively train 15 early stage researchers (ESRs) to PhD level; provide the research evidence to show how technology may improve care and quality of life for people with dementia; and provide the European workforce with a much needed new generation of excellent research trained professionals. The objectives of INDUCT are to: determine practical, cognitive & social factors to improve usability of technology; evaluate the effectiveness of specific contemporary technology; trace facilitators & barriers for implementation of technology in dementia care. Using advanced methods in applied health research (e.g. randomised controlled trials, qualitative studies) INDUCT will provide the evidence needed to demonstrate how to make dementia care technology more usable, more effective, and better implemented in practice, culminating in an international consensus guideline for improving policy and practice.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0.6,"WiFi":0.7,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.7,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0.6,"LiFi":0.7,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.6,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: LOCUS - LOCalization and analytics on-demand embedded in the 5G ecosystem, for Ubiquitous vertical applicationS Abstract: Context-awareness is essential for many existing and emerging applications. Context information greatly relies on location information of people and things. But, navigation satellite systems are denied in indoor environments, current cellular systems fail to provide high-accuracy localization, other local localization technologies (e.g. WI-FI or BT) imply high deployment\/maintenance\/integration costs. Raw spatiotemporal data are not sufficient by themselves and need to be integrated with tools for the analysis of the behaviour of physical targets, to extract relevant feature of interests.\nLOCUS will improve the functionality of 5G infrastructures to: i) provide accurate and ubiquitous location information as a network-native service and ii) derive more complex features and behavioural patterns out of raw location and physical events, and expose them to applications via simple interfaces. Localization, together with analytics, and their combined provision \u201cas a service\u201d, will greatly increase the overall value of the 5G ecosystem, allowing network operators to better manage their networks and to dramatically expand the range of offered applications and services. The current freedom to act on 5G system design and availability of software network paradigms and AI techniques uniquely combine in this historical moment to make it possible to radically improve the future network by endowing it with accurate on-demand localization and analytics.\nLOCUS will showcase its solutions in three scenarios: Smart Network Management based on Location Information of 5G equipment; Network-assisted Self-driving Objects; People Mobility & Flow Monitoring. \nThe LOCUS consortium gathers a diverse blend of high-profile partners including Operators, Vendors, IT industries and SMEs that can make its vision a reality.

{"text":"Title: WPCN - Wireless Powered Communication Networks: Architectures, Protocols and Optimized Resource Allocation Abstract: Wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is a promising networking paradigm for future wireless communication systems, where the batteries of wireless devices (WDs) are remotely replenished by means of microwave wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Compared to the conventional battery-powered communication networks, WPCN is in general more convenient by eliminating the hassle of connecting cables, more cost-effective by enabling on-demand energy supplies and maintenance-free operations, more environmental-friendly by avoiding tons of battery disposal yearly, and is sometimes essential for scenarios where manual battery replacement\/recharging is too dangerous (e.g., in hazardous environment) or even impossible (e.g., for biomedical implants).  However, the practical deployment of WPCN is hampered by several critical issues, such as the low end-to-end WPT efficiency over a long  distance, the inter-play between power and information transmissions within the same network, and the challenges of scalability in large networks. This project aims to resolve the above issues by paving the way for the practical deployment of WPCN. Towards this end, a comprehensive study on WPCN will be pursued, ranging from the networking architecture and protocol designs to optimized resource allocation. A number of innovative techniques will be proposed and thoroughly investigated in this project, including the new heterogeneous networking architecture for WPCN, the harvest-and-transmit protocol facilitated by the concept of energy-and-information full-duplexing, and the distributed energy beamforming technique with the idea of WD-initiated WPT.

{"text":"Title: CITYCoP - Citizen Interaction Technologies Yield Community Policing Abstract: Theories underlying community policing received new impetus with the recent advent of smartphones and social media and especially user-generated content (UGC) where citizens engage in closer interaction with their local community and law enforcement agency (LEA). The years 2010-2014 have seen a rapid upsurge of smartphone apps aimed at improving crime reporting and other forms of UGC and interaction associated with community policing. Yet these apps are characterised by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon approach with the largest number originating in the USA, a few in Canada, Australia and with the UK apparently the only major EU state where there has been some take-up of these technologies. CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining \u201clocal flavour\u201d and diversity.

{"text":"Title: KoolZone - KoolZone- refrigeration control technology to minimise food waste, avoid food poisoning and minimise energy consumption Abstract: The respected environmentalist David Hawken recently assessed that better refrigerant management could reduce global CO2 emissions by 96t globally by 2050. Demand for refrigeration is growing, driven by developing countries and implementation of food safety legislation, e.g. HACCP. Better management of refrigeration is a clear part of better refrigerant management. Increased refrigeration and legislation is a proportionate response to the million food poisoning cases diagnosed annually in the UK, 500 of which result in death. Food temperature monitoring in commercial sectors is mandatory in the UK, EU, US, Far East & Australia, where HACCP compliance is used to safeguard food safety. The majority of food producers, handlers, caterers and retailerls uses manual records due to the high cost (\u20ac600 hardware only)  and complication of retrofitting automated logging or more efficient control. Many businesses over-cool to avoid bad press & litigation from ill customers, needlessly increasing energy consumption. The lack of 24\/7 monitoring also leads to stock loss for food businesses. If a refrigeration unit fails out of hours, the operator will not know for several hours, meaning that stock is no longer fit for consumption.   \nOur focus is to create a disruptive, very low cost (\u20ac7.50\/month) complete refrigeration monitor and reporting system (inc. SaaS) for only \u20ac110 up front hardware cost. We have solved technical challenges around battery life, low-power electronics, enclosure design and antenna design. Our prototypes are genuine plug-and-play with zero on-site integration costs.

While voice control is becoming a widely accepted alternative, it is not yet sufficiently robust and reliable for use in many situations.\nXMOS are playing a fundamental role in the development of a next generation of human-machine interfaces \u2013 using natural language, the highly-developed systems of speech and gestures etc. used when people communicate. Embedded within their customers\u2019 consumer electronics, this will enable devices to recognise and understand us, reading context and quickly interacting like another person would \u2013 but anonymously and securely, using sound and radar. XMOS\u2019 capabilities will drive new classes of voice controlled devices, with low upfront cost allowing ubiquitous deployment of voice control, and higher quality user experience.\nThe experienced XMOS team has successfully commercialised their flexible XCore microprocessor, and is now focussed on voice interfaces as a high-growth sector. XMOS is already a leading provider of far-field voice interface technology, capable of separating a distant voice from noise in our living spaces, and has the most comprehensive portfolio of far-field voice interfaces.\nThe H2020 project will enable the realisation of the next-generation in XMOS voice control technologies, including a reconfigured architecture with disruptively low upfront cost, and new context recognition capabilities. XMOS will target a serviceable addressable market for IoT devices of $4 billion (CAGR of 32%), including smart TVs and audio equipment, consumer appliances and automotive applications, growing revenue by 20-fold and creating over 200 jobs by 2024.","gt":["radar","mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0.9,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.2,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.2,"mobile radio":0.1,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: UTOUCH - Universal mid-air haptic feedback Abstract: Ultrahaptics is the first and only company in the world to create a novel haptic feedback system that allows users to feel sensations in their bare hands while interacting in mid-air with a touchless sensing system. We use an array of ultrasonic speakers to create mid-air feeling without touching. Invisible forces are projected into the air and felt on human skin up to 1 metre away from the device. The activities planned in our project will allow us to create three routes to market \u2013 the bespoke solutions, the development kits (Dev Kit) and business-to-business (B2B) products. Within this project we will expand and actively pursue the Dev Kit and B2B route, where we will make development platforms and completed products available to companies that want to integrate Ultrahaptics in their applications. In the Dev Kit route, we will create embedded Ultrahaptic systems based on standard microprocessors that are offered with development boards (WP4) and software tools (WP3). This will allow a large range of small and medium enterprise companies to write their own applications without needing to go through our evaluation programme. In the B2B route, we will create simple ubiquitous modules such as touchless buttons with tactile feedback. To enable us to target a wide range of markets, we will pursue the Dev Kit and B2B route for 3 sizes of firmware - U5 which is closest to what we already have in-house in terms of processing speed and number of transducers required, U7 which maximises performance and features and U3 which is a low-cost solution.

{"text":"Title: PeTSoC - Lightweight and Flexible All-Perovskite Triple-junction Solar Cells Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources of the 21st century. For solar cells, the most important aspects for commercialization are power conversion efficiency and cost which can be combined into a \u20ac\/W metric. Today, over 90% of the global solar industry is comprised of single-junction crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, however, c-Si solar cells have some limitations. The first is their non-mechanically flexible nature and second, their single-junction limit of efficiency which can be surpassed by multijunction technology. Lead-halide perovskites are generating substantial scientific and industrial interest because they are low-cost, highly efficient and bandgap tunable, key criteria for multijunction solar cells. Furthermore, perovskites can be deposited via thermal co-evaporation meaning that the devices in this project, can be made from start-to-finish entirely from industrially attractive vacuum deposition techniques. Unlike conventional c-Si, perovskites are a thin-film technology, which means they can be made into lightweight and flexible solar cells with a high power-to-weight ratio. Thus, they have additional applications for (1) portable electronic devices including smartphones and displays, (2) vehicles, drones and aircraft, (3) wearable textiles, and more. The project draws from two distinct areas of photovoltaics research, specifically lightweight and flexibility with high-efficiency achieved by multijunction technology, allowing it to compete competitively with crystalline silicon in conventional solar energy generation and niche applications. The experienced researcher will be joining StranksLab to build a strong fundamental photophysical understanding of thermally co-evaporated perovskite layers via state-of-the-art spectroscopy tools to target the development of a lightweight and flexible all-perovskite triple-junction solar cell with an efficiency >30%.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Unlike ordinary metallic antennas, GPAs and Plasma Antenna Arrays can be reconfigured electrically (rather than mechanically) with respect to impedance, frequency, bandwidth and directivity on time scales the order of microseconds or milliseconds. It is also possible to stack arrays of GPAs designed to operate at different frequencies. A Plasma Antenna will be able to: (i) identifying the direction of incoming signal, (ii) tracking and locating the antenna beam on the mobile\/target, (iii) beam-steering while minimizing interferences.\nActual technology is based mainly on: (i) DC discharge, (ii) AC discharge, (iii) RF discharge, (iv) Microwaves, (v) Hollow cathode. Improvement of plasma source performances require a strong effort in term of modelling and technology. \nThe aim of PATH is to merge European competences to make a substantial step toward innovative hybrid plasma sources.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"microwave technology":0.7,"radio technology":0.6,"mobile radio":0.5,"data networks":0.4,"optical networks":0.3,"satellite radio":0.2,"telecommunications networks":0.2,"5G":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"teleology":0.0,"radar":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

It generates and distributes a \u201cprimary power bus\u201d whose characteristics are optimized to the mission needs. This bus is usually generated from solar arrays and electrochemical batteries. These power sources are controlled by a Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) which delivers the power bus. EPS is a major constituent of a satellite : its cost may reach up to 30% of the total platform cost.\n\nThere is a large design variety of power buses, with voltage levels typically ranging from 28 to 100V. This state-of-the-art is well adapted to past and current needs in term of power conditioning & distribution for science and telecommunication satellites.

{"text":"Title: OCTAVE - Objective Control for TAlker VErification Abstract: Industry needs alternatives to textual passwords for access control. While tokens can still be stolen or transferred to other persons, biometrics technology can provide reliable, cost-effective and user-friendly solutions.\nThe proliferation of smart services calls for unsupervised authentication at a distance. Being natural, non-intrusive and readily compatible with smart and mobile devices, automatic speaker verification (ASV) is an appealing solution. Even so, today\u2019s state-of-the-art ASV systems lack robustness to environmental variability and are vulnerable to spoofing. Concerns regarding interoperability, scalability and privacy also form barriers to exploitation.\nWhile embracing standards, in addition to a privacy and interoperability-by-design ethos, OCTAVE will integrate commercial-grade and new, hybrid ASV systems with the latest environmental robustness and anti-spoofing technologies to deliver a scalable, trusted biometric authentication service (TBAS). While simultaneously relieving end-users from the inconvenience of dealing with textual passwords, the OCTAVE platform will reduce the economic and practical burdens related to password loss and recovery. The TBAS will support single (text-dependent, text-prompted and text-independent) in addition to hybrid operating modes. The delegation of authentication to a single, yet distributed TBAS, will increase trust and privacy, avoid single points of failure and allow for rapid breach notification and remediation.\nSolutions will be installed in data-sensitive and mission-critical services and validated in two real commercial trials: banking services and physical access within a critical airport infrastructure. Flexibility will support wider exploitation in future applications in, for example, customer care, telephone banking, e-commerce, logical and physical access control. OCTAVE will thus fuel new opportunities for commercial services making use of electronic identification and authentication.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.6,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

This unique RI will bridge the gap by linking the agri-food and nutrition-health domains and account for the regional and socio-economic diversity of the EU. The RI will be instrumental to produce a scientifically reliable, technically sound and socio-legally robust evidence-base that enables scientists to efficiently collect, unlock, connect and share research data of EU-citizens. \nConsumers are central to the design: they harbour crucial information, as they increasingly adopt mobile apps and tech-wear, get access to e-business data and even medical information. Collectively, such real-life-time data create new opportunities for research, by e.g., monitoring of food-behaviour providing personalized feedback.  For further testing, detailing and underpinning and theory-building,  interfaces will be created to distributed facilities for experimental research, e.g., virtual supermarkets. Further enrichment of data is achieved via interfaces with information systems for food and health.\nThe consumer-focus and the scientific evidence of RICHFIELDS will, via its services, be available to (a) EU-consumers and consumer platforms, (b) stakeholders along the food chain, and (c) policy actors in the agri-food and nutrition-health domain.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.8,"WiFi":0.8,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0.8,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

First, we will define metrics so that the wireless performance of CEAA can be measured. EM properties of concrete and the inhomogeneity of EM properties will be taken into account. Then, we will establish the relationship between the ratio and layout of admixtures and the EM properties of concrete. Three simplified concrete model, i.e., multilayer, lattice and 3D Poisson point process (PPP) models, will be proposed and verified through simulations and measurements.

{"text":"Title: BEACON - Hybrid Digital-Analog Networking under Extreme Energy and Latency Constraints Abstract: The objective of the BEACON project is to (re-)introduce analog communications into the design of modern wireless networks. We argue that the extreme energy and latency constraints imposed by the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm can only be met within a hybrid digital-analog communications framework. Current network architectures separate source and channel coding, orthogonalize users, and employ long block-length digital source and channel codes, which are either suboptimal or not applicable under the aforementioned constraints. BEACON questions these well-established design principles, and proposes to replace them with a hybrid digital-analog communications framework, which will meet the required energy and latency constraints while simplifying the encoding and decoding processes. BEACON pushes the performance of the IoE to its theoretical limits by i) exploiting signal correlations that are abundant in IoE applications, given the foreseen density of deployed sensing devices, ii) taking into account the limited and stochastic nature of energy availability due to, for example, energy harvesting capabilities, iii) using feedback resources to improve the end-to-end signal distortion, and iv) deriving novel converse results to identify fundamental performance benchmarks.\n\nThe results of BEACON will not only shed light on the fundamental limits on the performance any coding scheme can achieve, but will also lead to the development of unconventional codes and communication protocols that can approach these limits, combining digital and analog communication techniques. The ultimate challenge for this project is to exploit the developed hybrid digital-analog networking theory for a complete overhaul of the physical layer design for emerging IoE applications, such as smart grids, tele-robotics and smart homes.

{"text":"Title: mmChannel - millimeter Wave Channel Modelling Considering Environmental Factors Abstract: The Millimetre-wave (mmWave) frequency band offers wide available bandwidth for 5G and future wireless networks. However, due to the large propagation attenuation of the mmWave frequency, real-world environmental factors, including weather, foliage, humans, vehicles, have a significant impact on the channel path loss. In order to design and optimise 5G and future networks, a mmWave channel model considering the environmental factors is urgently required. In this project, we aim to equip a ray-tracing channel model with environmental factors in the mmWave band. The goal will be approached through 3 work packages (WPs). First, the ER will develop a parametric attenuation model by parameterising the environmental factors and integrate it with a ray-tracing simulation model.

{"text":"Title: PROMIS - Postgraduate Research on Dilute Metamorphic Nanostructures and Metamaterials in Semiconductor Photonics Abstract: Photonics, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing technologies have been identified as key enabling technologies (KETs) for the EU. Today the photonics global market alone is around \u20ac300 billion and Europe has established a strong position with a total share of 20%, directly employing about 290,000 people. However, the shortage of sufficient skilled labour and entrepreneurs capable of handling the highly multi-disciplinary nature of KETs remains a major problem in the EU. Tailoring of semiconductors at the nanoscale is an important enabling technology for a wide range of photonics and electronics applications in diverse areas. In the training network proposed here, a cohort of 15 early stage researchers will be trained in the full range of skills required for a career in photonics, including materials growth, device fabrication, characterisation, design, theory, and commercialisation. A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 8 academic partners, 2 full industry partners and 7 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be developed within four burgeoning research areas; Semiconductor Metamaterials & Plasmonics, Dilute Nitride semiconductor nanostructures, Hydrogenated Semiconductors and Metamorphic structures. The outcomes of this enabling fundamental research are well focused to deliver advances in sources for secure communications, sensitive detectors for security applications, more efficient solar cells for energy generation, LEDs and sensors for environmental gas and bio-sensing. Each researcher will experience both academic and commercial environments thanks to the strong industrial involvement, resulting in multi-skilled, industry-focused graduates. PROMIS therefore directly addresses the need for additional skilled photonics professionals, as identified by the European Technology Platform, Photonics21.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0.6,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: IoRL - Internet of Radio Light Abstract: Wireless networks in buildings suffer from congestion, interference, security and safety concerns, restricted propagation and poor in-door location accuracy. The Internet of Radio-Light (IoRL) project develops a safer, more secure, customizable and intelligent building network that reliably delivers increased throughput (greater than 10Gbps) from access points pervasively located within buildings, whilst minimizing interference and harmful EM exposure and providing location accuracy of less than 10 cm. It thereby shows how to solve the problem of broadband wireless access in buildings and promotes the establishment of a global standard in ITU. Building landlords will be incentivized to find funding to realize this solution for their properties to increase their value resulting in a stimulated market for broadband networking products in buildings, benefiting society and stimulating the world Gross Domestic Product. IoRL project provides solutions to the two main barriers to develop this broadband networking solution in buildings because it: (i) Brings together a multi-disciplinary team of research institutions and industries in a collaborative project to develop and demonstrate this vision, who otherwise would not have assembled to achieve this goal; (ii) Develops a proof of concept demonstrator, which will act as the basis for standardization of a global solution. The starting point is the joint VLC demonstrator at Tsinghua University & ISEP, the mmWave at Cobham Wireless and the NFV\/SDN at NCSR-Democratos. The challenges are to (i) Develop broadband communication solutions for buildings by integrating these technologies to exploit the pervasiveness and accessibility of the existing electric light access points, the broadband capacities of mmWave and VLC technologies and the flexibility of SDN\/NFV; (ii) Industrially design a radio-light solution that can be integrated into the myriad of form factors of existing electric light systems and consumer products.","gt":["5G","LiFi"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0.8,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.8,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0,"LiFi":0.9,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}

Looking ahead, MaMi will have far more general applications: optical communications, radar, and wireless power transfer to name a few. The grand question that the proposed research will address is: Are the existing IT tools sufficient to understand the physical phenomena and develop the upcoming generation of MaMi-based systems in ten years from now?

Their work becomes more problematic considering the heterogeneity of threats, the wideness of the surveyed area, the adverse weather conditions and the wide range of terrains. Although there are several research tools and works targeting these areas independently for border surveillance, nowadays border authorities do not have access to an intelligent holistic solution providing all aforementioned functionalities.\nTowards delivering such a solution, ROBORDER aims at developing and demonstrating a fully-functional autonomous border surveillance system with unmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles, capable of functioning both as standalone and in swarms, which will incorporate multimodal sensors as part of an interoperable network. The system will be equipped with adaptable sensing and robotic technologies that can operate in a wide range of operational and environmental settings. To provide a complete and detailed situational awareness picture that supports highly efficient operations, the network of sensors will include static networked sensors such as border surveillance radars, as well as mobile sensors customised and installed on board unmanned vehicles. \nTo succeed implementing an operational solution, a number of supplementary technologies will also be applied that will enable the establishment of robust communication links between the command and control unit and the heterogeneous robots. On top of this, detection capabilities for early identification of criminal activities and hazardous incidents will be developed.

A wider range of applications is envisioned for industrial manufacturing, augmented reality and autonomous cars. It makes use of artificial intelligence, where compute functions will be offloaded from devices into the cloud. Accordingly, future IoT will need wireless links with high data rates, low latency and reliable connectivity despite the limited radio spectrum. Connected lighting is an interesting infrastructure for IoT services because it enables visible light communication (VLC), i.e. a wireless communication using unlicensed light spectrum. LED luminaires have enough modulation bandwidth for high data rates and each luminaire can be used as a wireless access point. Networked VLC-enhanced luminaires will add new features to build a wireless network for the IoT. ELIOT will start from existing prototypes and develop the support for IoT services. The project will integrate the lighting infrastructure with VLC and add positioning, multicast communications and enhanced security. ELIOT will demonstrate the new infrastructure in real environments at TRL \u22656 and mobile IoT devices at TRL \u2265 4.

This creates a significant need to lift existing technological barriers of actual fluidity and scalability of cloud resources towards promoting cloud computing as a critical cornerstone for digital economy.\n\nACTiCLOUD proposes a novel cloud computing architecture for drastically improved management of cloud resources, targeting 1.5x increase in resource efficiency and more than 10x in scalability.

It will be validated for quantifying Legionella and Escherichia coli (E. coli) population within 120 minutes from obtaining the sample, overcoming in this way the main disadvantage of traditional methods used in laboratories, i.e. long time-to results which can currently last up to 12 days in the case of Legionella and 1 day for E. coli. The targeted detection limit will be 10-100 cells\/L and 5-20 cells\/100 mL for Legionella and E.coli, respectively. Also, the new imaging cytometer will have a portable form, a size similar to a smart-phone, which will increase its versatility and widen the possibilities of onsite applications. The relevance of the project is clear when one thinks about the high risk of legionellosis in some specific industrial environments, such as cooling waters, evaporative condensers and air conditioning systems and the fact that E. coli is one of the faecal pollution index commonly analyzed for monitoring the presence of waterborne pathogens and hence the quality of bathing waters.

Over large scales, this can only be achieved in a cost-effective manner using Earth Observation (EO) technologies. The development of SAV-EO is, therefore, proposed which will employ novel remote sensing methodologies, based on thousands of freely-available optical & radar satellite data for the mapping & monitoring of fractional woody cover over the entire southern African savannah region (1,500,000km2). A monitoring tool that identifies underlying land degradation processes, such as bush encroachment & deforestation, will also be devised based on a dense time-series analysis approach using all available data from the 45-year long Landsat archive. Another objective of SAV-EO is to provide an advancement in the design of operational indicators for the assessment & monitoring of land degradation, within the Land Degradation Neutrality framework suggested by the UN, in order to achieve the target of the Sustainable Development Goals to combat desertification by the 2030.\n\nThe innovative algorithms, data & outputs will be made available open-access via a bespoke web-GIS platform & numerous dissemination & communication activities, thus providing an invaluable resource for scientists & policy makers alike.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"radar":0.8,"optical networks":0.5,"data networks":0.5,"satellite radio":0.5,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: MUSMICRO - Causes and consequences of variation in the mammalian microbiota Abstract: The mammalian gut teems with a particularly dense and diverse microbial community, the composition of which varies widely among hosts. A large body of laboratory work suggests these communities provide important functions for the host \u2013 including nutrition, pathogen protection and immune development \u2013 but we know very little about what shapes the mammalian gut microbiota, and how it affects the host, in natural populations. \nA major barrier to progress is a lack of powerful investigative tools for most wild animal species. I will overcome this by studying a natural population of the species that has the best laboratory tools, and knowledge, for the mammalian microbiome: the house mouse. Specifically, I will set up a new wild house mouse system and use it to address three broad questions: 1) what drives natural variation in the gut microbiota? 2) does microbiota variation predict fitness traits in the wild? and, critically, 3) does microbiota variation causally affect fitness-relevant traits? To do this, I will pair detailed, longitudinal studies of wild mice with controlled experiments in the lab, making use of state-of-the-art tools for this species, including: (i) faecal transplant experiments with germ-free animals, to test the phenotypic impact of different wild mouse microbiotas (ii) high resolution genotyping methods and (iii) new radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology we have recently developed for monitoring wild rodent survival and behaviour.\nBy doing so, this project will directly tackle the key unanswered question: does the composition of the mammalian gut microbiota actually matter in nature?","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: SPA4AstroQIT - Broadband Quantum-Limited Parametric Amplifier for Astronomy and Quantum Information Technology Abstract: The emerging technology of superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) can achieve quantum-limited sensitivity over broad bandwidth, by utilising the wave-mixing mechanism in a passive nonlinear transmission medium. They are compact, easy to fabricate with planar circuit technology, have ultra-low heat dissipation, and can be integrated directly with other detector circuits. Their performances are far superior to the state-of-the-art high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier, and they can operate from radio to THz frequencies. Therefore, they could potentially revolutionise almost every kind of microwave, millimetre (mm) and sub-millimetre (sub-mm) instrumentation: from observational astronomy to quantum information experiments. Their deployment as readout amplifiers could improve the heterodyne receiver sensitivity significantly, and enable the construction of large bolometric arrays. Their large bandwidth, high power handling and quantum-noise performance could have profound effect on quantum computing architecture, improve the fidelity to process hundreds of quantum bits (qubit). They can be used as front-end high frequency amplifiers operating at THz frequencies, which is hard to achieve with HEMT technology. In this proposal, I aim to develop: 1) ultra-broadband readout amplifiers for mm\/sub-mm astronomical receivers and qubit experiments, which would enable the construction of large pixel-count system; 2) front-end amplifiers at mm frequencies for heterodyne receivers and B-mode Cosmic Microwave Background experiments; and 3) parametric frequency down-converter with positive conversion gain to replace Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) as ultra-low noise heterodyne mixer for large array application. The successful development of these programmes not only could transform the mm\/sub-mm instrumentation in the future, but could also have huge impact on many other fields such as telecommunications, medical and quantum computing technology.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.9,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.9,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

For each testbed, 5G-MoNArch will instantiate the architecture and complement it with a use case specific functionality \u2013 the two functional innovations of 5G-MoNArch: (i) resilience and security, needed to meet the sea port requirements, and (ii) resource elasticity, to make an efficient use of the resources in the touristic city. \n\nImpact: 5G-MoNArch has a very high potential for commercial impact, including enhanced products (e.g., orchestrators or edge-cloud RAN), novel services (enabled by network slicing) and opportunities for new market players.

{"text":"Title: REACH - Renewable Energy and Connectivity Hub Abstract: Being a world leader in e-learning, e-banking and remote healthcare, EU companies are yet struggle to access the potential market of 1.4 billion off-grid people in developing regions. Off-grid communities in these regions rely on mobile phones for communication and to access essential services such as money transfer, healthcare. Without viable renewable alternatives, off-grid power in developing regions is currently provided through highly unsustainable fossil fuelled methods, and internet connectivity is exceptionally limited. This creates a significant business opportunity for providing reliable, clean and affordable charging for mobile phones and internet access. BuffaloGrid has developed a unique solar power based Hub system and a patent-pending remote payment control mechanism by which mobile phones (or other devices) can be charged under the control of a central server to ensure accountability, transparency and market insights. By combining renewable power and internet connectivity, BuffaloGrid enables EU companies to deliver essential internet-based services (e.g., e-health, e-education, e-governance etc) in developing regions. BuffaloGrid supplies Hubs free to local agents, offering them opportunities to provide mobile charging and internet access to their local communities. This will stimulate local enterprise, encourage entrepreneurship and boost economic development. BuffaloGrid\u2019s unique model of providing the Hub for free, and unlocking access to power, allows demand to be met without charging high fees. Powered by solar energy, BuffaloGrid Hubs are emission-free during use and BuffaloGrid will take back Hubs for upgrade\/ remanufacture\/recycling at EoL (End-of-Life). During this project BuffaloGrid will develop a detail design of cost-optimised, mass-producible BuffaloGrid Hub with EU supply chain.

Since 2000, approximately 163,000 people have died from global terrorism. In particular, attacks against citizens and urban soft targets have increased as terrorists exploit the ability of autonomous cells and lone individuals to hit civilian targets such as concerts, markets, shopping malls, airports, transport hubs, sports stadia, cinemas, bars, night clubs and tourist resorts. Recent devastating attacks across Europe clearly illustrate the increasing threat that exists. \n\nIt is impossible to deploy security personnel in sufficient numbers to protect every location. Even if security personnel are present they currently lack the technology to detect, at a safe range, concealed threats such as person borne improvised explosive devices (PBIEDs), guns and knives.

{"text":"Title: realTRIPS - Redefining Variability: Evaluating Land Use and Transport Impacts on Urban Mobility Patterns Abstract: Urban mobility analysis, advanced by the emerging fine-granularity location data (e.g. smart card data, mobile phone data and social media data), has received significant attention in recent years. It has become an important subject for understanding the functionality, ever-increasing dynamism and complexity of urban space. realTRIPS aims to open a new avenue of research in urban mobility analysis using emerging automatic data by developing an analytical and modelling framework, particularly addressing variability across spatial-temporal scales. I argue that the variability of urban mobility should not be simply interpreted as a number of errors, but indicators of changes in regular human behaviours impacted by land use and transport at different scales. A deeper understanding of variability and regularity would contribute to a more accurate prediction of urban development scenarios. The relevant theories and measures on variability have been long-researched in spatial statistics, but not well applied to the context of urban mobility studies. The proposed framework will take advantage of the research progress in multi-disciplines and leverage key concepts from uncertainty in spatial analysis, time geography, and land use transport planning.

{"text":"Title: SwiftV2X - Smart mmWave and MultiRATs for Multihop Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Abstract: The push for improved driving experience, including the ultimate goal of driverless vehicles, has fueled the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Connectivity is an important enabler for CAVs, as it allows for autonomous vehicles to directly participate in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) and make collective intelligent decisions. 5G mobile networks play an important role in providing vehicular connectivity as mobile networks support mobility by default. However, the density of vehicles is high in urban areas that poses challenges for the support from mobile networks. Deploying ultra-dense small cells using millimetre wave (mmWave) communication is one promising solution since ultra-dense small cells deployment addresses the network capacity and mmWave addresses the interference arisen from the dense deployment. However, due to the relatively narrow footprint of a mmWave beam, using mmWave communication for fast moving vehicles requires careful allocation to utilise its potential and avoid selfishness in radio resource usage. This project sets an ambitious goal of designing smart and dynamic algorithms to manage mmWave beam allocations in CAV environments. The project first investigates solely on the mmWave beam allocations and proposes smart algorithm using both traditional optimisation technique for benchmarking and modern machine learning algorithms for practical operation. It then studies the radio resource allocation under multi radio access technologies (multiRATs) that is the likely deployment setup before the full mmWave small cell networks become practical in the future. Finally, our study is extended to vehicle-to-vehicle communication using mmWave that can support delay sensitive message exchanges and range extension. As experimentation needs expensive infrastructure, the foreseen secondments offer partners without infrastructure on their premises to test their design on other partners that possess the infrastructure.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0.8,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.6,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

Abstract: Effective hearing ability influences individuals\u2019 overall quality of life, particularly in situations (such as in work-places, meetings, classrooms, social gatherings, or using audio devices) where unwanted noise constantly tests and challenges our audio processing capabilities. In these situations all existing hearing aids share a common underlying concept flaw due to the fixed position of the microphone and the lack of user interactivity. Coupled with inelegant and unfashionable designs, this causes many hearing-impaired individuals to opt out of using hearing aids and withdraw from these social\/work group situations.\nThe Smartphone platform is an excellent example of technology with the potential to enhance the audio experience of individuals with hearing loss whilst blurring the distinction between hearing and consumer technologies. Combined with our innovative audio separation techniques and pioneering wireless technology, it removes the social stigma and provides a significant step change in hearing market accessibility, dispensing and affordability allowing everyone to live fuller normal lives. Auriplex\u2019s Smartphone \u201cA new concept in hearing\u2026\u201d is innovative not only in technology but also in the market reach strategy: the solution would be aimed at a new market that is distinctly different from current hearing aid offerings but at the same time will be familiar as a consumer product and a logical next step with most technology users not only in the hard-of-hearing but also in the hearing world.

{"text":"Title: SONATA - Service Programing and Orchestration for Virtualized Software Networks Abstract: Virtualisation and software networks are a major disruptive technology for communications networks, enabling services to be deployed as software functions running directly in the network on commodity hardware. However, deploying the more complex user-facing applications and services envisioned for 5G networks presents significant technological challenges for development and deployment. SONATA addresses both issues.\n\nFor service development, SONATA provides service patterns and description techniques for composed services. A customised SDK is developed to boost the efficiency of developers of network functions and composed services, by integrating catalogue access, editing, debugging, and monitoring analysis tools with service packaging for shipment to an operator.\n\nFor deployment, SONATA provides a novel service platform to manage service execution. The platform complements the SDK with functionality to validate service packages. Moreover, it improves on existing platforms by providing a flexible and extensible orchestration framework based on a plugin architecture. Thanks to SONATA\u2019s platform service developers can provide custom algorithms to steer the orchestration of their services: for continuous placement, scaling, life-cycle management and contextualization of services. These algorithms are overseen by executives in the service platform, ensuring trust and resolving any conflict between services.\n\nBy combining rapid development and deployment in an open and flexible manner, SONATA is realising an extended DevOps model for network stakeholders.\n\nSONATA validates its approach through novel use-case-driven pilot implementations and disseminates its results widely by releasing its key SDK and platform components as open source software, through scientific publications and standards contributions, which, together, will have a major impact on incumbent stakeholders including network operators and manufacturers and will open the market to third-party developers.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

The first part of the Flagship was a 30-month Collaborative Project, Coordination and Support Action (CP-CSA) under the 7th framework program (2013-2016), while this and the following parts are implemented as Core Projects under the Horizon 2020 framework.\n\nThe mission of the Graphene Flagship is to take graphene and related layered materials from a state of raw potential to a point where they can revolutionise multiple industries. This will bring a new dimension to future technology \u2013 a faster, thinner, stronger, flexible, and broadband revolution. Our program will put Europe firmly at the heart of the process, with a manifold return on the EU investment, both in terms of technological innovation and economic growth.\n\nTo realise this vision, we have brought together a larger European consortium with about 150 partners in 23 countries. The partners represent academia, research institutes and industries, which work closely together in 15 technical work packages and five supporting work packages covering the entire value chain from materials to components and systems. As time progresses, the centre of gravity of the Flagship moves towards applications, which is reflected in the increasing importance of the higher - system - levels of the value chain. In this first core project the main focus is on components and initial system level tasks. \n\nThe first core project is divided into 4 divisions, which in turn comprise 3 to 5 work packages on related topics.

{"text":"Title: SPICES - Space-borne observations for detecting and forecasting sea ice cover extremes Abstract: The main objective of this proposal is to develop new methods to retrieve sea ice parameters from existing (and imminent) satellite sensors to provide enhanced products for polar operators and prediction systems, specifically addressing extreme and unexpected conditions. \nAutomatic remote sensing products traditionally provide general information on sea ice conditions such as ice extent and concentration. However, for ice charting, tactical navigation and management of off-shore activities much more important is to know and avoid hazardous sea ice conditions. In general, sea ice hazards are related to sea ice thickness. More often than not polar ships and off-shore platforms are only operating during summer seasons and certain regions. This is because they are designed to resist typical forces of induced by pack ice, but they are not designed to resist the extreme sea ice conditions. \n\nOngoing climate warming has manifested as shrinking and thinning of pack ice in the Arctic. This is a primary driver for the increasing shipping, oil and gas explorations and mining activities in the Arctic. However, severe sea ice conditions still exist and in consequence many locations are impossible for ship based operations. Moreover, year-to-year variability of sea ice is very large and hazardous multiyear ice (MYI) floes sometimes appear also in typically seasonally ice free regions.\n\nIn order to response needs of increase polar activities, we propose to focus on detection of sea ice extremes and automatic production of \u201csea ice warnings\u201d products. In particular, we aim for a detection of MYI floes in a area composed mostly first-year ice from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), heavily ridged ice regions from SAR, the thickest ice from radar altimeter (RA) thickness profiles, regional anomalies of thick or thin ice via passive microwave (PMW) data, sea ice areas vulnerable for the wave action, detection of early\/late melting season and improving capabilities to forecast seasonal sea ice extremes.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"radar":0.9,"microwave technology":0.8,"radio technology":0.7,"satellite radio":0.6,"data networks":0.4,"optical networks":0.3,"telecommunications":0.2,"radio frequency":0.1,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.1,"5G":0.1,"teleology":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: SMARTER-2 - Surveillance of MARiTime surroundings through lasER technology Abstract: Contact and collision incidences are now the most increasing, most frequent and overall the most costly type of accidents in the maritime transport sector, representing 40% of yearly insurance claims and force 1 out of 10 ships to an unplanned dry dock every year costing on average \u20ac400,000 per incident. Semi and fully submerged objects are particularly causing havoc to shipping and offshore platforms because they go undetected by state-of-the-art sensors (radars, sonars, optical sensors) presenting an acute need for improved observation capability of the ocean surface layer. A major concern considering the importance of shipping in general (90% of world\u2019s trade), their asset value (up to \u20ac 1 Billion cost to build) and the number of people at sea (about 2 Billion transported yearly). Similarly, the maritime security situation is worsening forcing vessels in average to spend \u20ac170,000 a year on security related solutions. The project opportunity arises from today\u2019s inability to observe this challenging ocean layer, causing unsatisfying operational risks in a greatly expanding market (with more frequent and more costly security and safety incidents in line with the strong industry expansion). These incidents can be reduced by an appropriate observational sensor like a ladar. It can detect for example drifting growlers (ice floes) or floating containers ahead of a vessel, preventing damaging collisions. The information that the sensor collects can also be directly used for operators to reduce operational cost, for example by accurately observing the sea state as to optimize sail plan models and vessel trim for fuel and emission savings. Such benefits have value for the operators, allowing them to purchase a relatively low cost sensor compared to the costs of an offshore or maritime incident. Moreover, the ladar is complementary to radar, sonar, and other maritime sensors. It would therefore fill a market gap rather than outcompeting existing sensor technologies.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"radar":0.9,"optical networks":0.8,"radio technology":0.7,"data networks":0.6,"telecommunications":0.5,"microwave technology":0.4,"radio frequency":0.3,"mobile phones":0.2,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"4G":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"5G":0.1,"teleology":0.0,"LiFi":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: Constance - Flight Critical Wireless Slip Ring for Civil Tiltrotor Abstract: Slip rings for transferring power and data commonly form the interface between a rotating environment and a stationary domain. For aerospace applications, currently only conventional slip rings, with brushes, are on the market. The technique is proven, fairly reliable and robust, but there are clear drawbacks: wear, size and compromised signal integrity due to electrical noise.  \nA few commercial wireless slip rings are now available, however not designed and certified for aerospace applications. Flight-critical applications in harsh environments require a fault-tolerant design. The future need for qualification has to be taken into account from the start of the development.\nThe call for proposal asks for the development of wireless slip rings for power and data transfer for a flight-critical application within the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR). This CfP is a technical and industrial challenge, which provides an opportunity for improving competitiveness on this important improvement part of the NGCTR program of the CS2 work plan.\nFor the development of Constance, NLR will combine their tiltrotor experience from the FP5 TILTAERO and FP7 NICETRIP programs with their patented wireless slip ring design and knowledge from the Contra-Rotating Open Rotor project of the CS2 Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft program. The distinguishing feature of the Constance slip ring is the specific orientation of the rotor and stator parts of the contactless slip ring which makes the design mechanically robust, safe and fault tolerant up to high rotational speeds. For the extension towards the flight-critical application on the tiltrotor the expertise of DDC Electronics Ltd. on power converters will be fully incorporated into the proven technology.   \nIn Constance, three redundant slip ring assemblies with flight clearance will be delivered to the topic manager for ground and flight testing on their NGCTR and two models will be used for extensive qualification tests.

Whereas semiconductor physics has arisen from quantum science, the engineering principles of these first generation devices have remained anchored on classical physics. We are presently at the verge of a second revolution of quantum science, where quantum engineering based on direct exploitation of fundamental quantum mechanical abilities such as superposition and entanglement promises entire new technologies for society. However, lack of scalability of quantum information (QI) technology remains the fundamental technical challenge preventing most QI technologies from becoming a reality - a critical bottleneck to which a new generation of researchers is urgently needed. In QUDOT-TECH we build from the semiconductor QD - the most mature QI technology - and propose a solution to the scalability obstacle in the form of a quantum network based on QDs coupled efficiently to each other using optical waveguides. We will construct the world\u2019s first platform for fully integrated on-chip QI processing, a cornerstone potentially equivalent to the silicon transistor in the first generation of quantum devices. As this is frontier research, current doctoral research programmes do not provide the required interdisciplinary skillset and the entrepreneurial-like mind-set required to secure application-oriented breakthroughs within the QI field. Hereto, we have gathered the best European academic and industrial partners to train 15 ESRs to an outstanding level, where they can act as Europe\u2019s future leaders within QI technology.

The ability of Photonics to handle high data rates and high frequencies and its easy reconfigurability is critical in this scenario, where current purely RF technologies are limited in SWaP and performance. However, the use of Photonics is currently restricted to a few demonstrations in non-critical equipment, due to their perceived immaturity compared to RF. RETINA will develop several key RF-photonic building blocks to TRL5-6, designing, fabricating and testing 1) multi-beam TTD phased array antennas for X band operation, 2) a photonic integrated beamforming network, 3) novel configuration active X-band antenna array and 4) miniaturized space-grade components and subsystems. Miniaturization will be achieved by integrating lasers and external modulators with electronics in the Tx side, integrating photodiodes, amplifiers and electronics at the Rx side and by fabricating a PIC beamformer.

This will change the way users-to-things interactions are viewed.\n\nCombining the power of functional inks with the pervasiveness of digital (e.g. QR-codes) and electronic (e.g. NFC tags) markers, zillions of objects will embed cheap sensing capabilities thus being able to capture new contextual information. Beside this, the ubiquitous presence of smartphones with their cameras and NFC readers will create the perfect bridge between everyday users and their objects. This will create a completely new flow of crowdsourced information, which extracted from the objects and enriched with user data, can be exploited by new services. \n\nTagItSmart will create an open, interoperable cloud-based platform with all the tools and enabling technologies, which will address the challenges related to the lifecycle management of new innovative services capitalizing on objects \u201csensorization\u201d. TagItSmart will empower all steps involved from creating smart markers, Functional Codes (FCs), to supporting secure and reliable acquisition and consumption of such contextual data, while preserving user privacy, to the provision of generic functionalities and a service composition platform which will allow even inexperienced users to create and deploy their FCs based services while maintaining system efficiency.\n\nTo boost the platform adoption, a set of industrial use cases will be used as a baseline for development, while additional stakeholders will be engaged through a co-creation Open Call approach. A carefully planned engagement activity will ensure the establishment and sustainable expansion of the TagItSmart ecosystem fostering long term innovation and exploitation capabilities well beyond the project duration.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.2,"mobile radio":0.2,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: STUSOCSTA - Students, social change and the construction of the post-independence Algerian state, 1962-1978 Abstract: This project seeks to bring a new perspective to understanding state construction in Algeria after independence. Through a history of the first generations of Algerians who went to university in the 1960s and 1970s, it explores the intersections between political and institutional transformations and social, cultural and economic processes. These processes include increasing literacy, rural to urban migration, migration to study abroad and changes in gender relations and family structures. Bringing together concepts and methodologies from across a number of humanities and social science disciplines, the project will produce a case study setting out new approaches to studying state-building as a dynamic process which takes place at different levels of power (transnational, national and local) and which both shapes, and is shaped by, individual agency and wider processes. The goal is for this approach to be applicable to a range of other post-colonial contexts, challenging teleological readings of post-independence histories and homogenising understandings of post-independence states. \n\nThe project is to be carried out in Algeria, France and the UK, with the researcher working with leading experts in the field in each of these countries to create a transnational, interdisciplinary network exploring the central research themes.

{"text":"Title: SmartGraphene - Graphene based smart surfaces: from visible to microwave Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to develop adaptive camouflage systems using graphene-enabled smart surfaces. We propose a new class of active surfaces capable of real-time electrical-control of its appearance in a very broad spectrum ranging from visible to microwave covering 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The proposed method relies on controlling electromagnetic waves by tuning density of high-mobility charges on single or multilayers of atomically thin graphene electrodes. We will realize this goal by efficient gating of large-area graphene using ionic liquids which yields unprecedented ability to control intensity and phase of the reflected and transmitted electromagnetic waves from the surface. Based on underlying physical mechanisms and applications, the proposed research plan is structured in 3 main directions; (1) Active surfaces in microwave and THz, (2) Active thermal surfaces, and (3) Active surfaces in the visible. \n\nThe core idea of the proposal is based on a mutually-gated capacitor structure consisting of ionic liquid electrolyte sandwiched between two large area graphene. The voltage applied between the electrodes polarizes the ionic liquid and accumulates high-density of charges.

Then we will use these tools to fabricate new camouflage and display technologies on flexible polymers and paper substrates which cannot be realized by conventional semiconducting materials.

Both require relevant ICT infrastructure operators to perform risk assessments, introduce appropriate security measures to manage identified risks, and report security breaches. Unfortunately, risk-based approaches are notoriously difficult to implement in a consistent and comprehensive fashion. They depend on a high level of understanding of both cybersecurity and of the system or network to be protected, are labour intensive and costly and typically done by small teams. This is increasingly inappropriate as health care providers introduce IoT systems, cloud services and (in the near future) 5G networks to provide services in which patients are more engaged, may own some of the devices used, and want access in hospitals, on the move or at home. The ProTego project will develop a toolkit and guidelines to help health care systems users address cybersecurity risks in this new environment by introducing 3 main advances over current approaches: Extensive use of machine intelligence: a combination of machine inference exploiting a priory knowledge for security-by-design, and machine learning from data for run-time threat detection and diagnosis; Advanced data protection measures: advanced encryption techniques and hardware based full memory encryption, and multi-stakeholder IAM to control access to and by user devices, to protect data at rest and provide ultra-secure data exchange portals; Innovative protocols for stakeholder education: using security-by-design analysis to target training and support stakeholders to contribute to networok overall security.The toolkit will be integrated and validated in IoT and BYOD-based case studies at two hospitals.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.5,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.5,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: i-PROGNOSIS - Intelligent Parkinson eaRly detectiOn Guiding NOvel Supportive InterventionS Abstract: Transition from healthy status to Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is vaguely tractable, since symptoms can be so subtle in the early stages that they go unnoticed. Lack of biomarkers and\/or findings on routine MRI and CT scans, PD is left undiagnosed for years, gradually affecting the life of over 6.5 million of older adults (>55-60 yrs) worldwide, increasing the risk of their health deterioration. Epidemiological studies conclude that early intervention could have an inverse relation with the PD-related risks of progressive frailty, falls and emotional shift towards depression. Based on this evidence, the cardinal objective of i-PROGNOSIS is the development of (i) an ICT-based behavioural analysis approach for capturing, as early as possible, the PD symptoms appearance, and (ii) the application of ICT-based interventions countering identified risks. To achieve this, awareness initiatives will be employed, so as to construct i-PROGNOSIS community, targeting > 5000 older individuals within the duration of the project, in order to unobtrusively sense large scale behavioural data from its members, acquired from their natural use of mobile devices (smartphone\/smartwatch). Ensuring anonymisation and secure Cloud archiving, i-PROGNOSIS will develop and employ advanced big data analytics and machine learning techniques, in a distributed and privacy aware fashion, so as to instantiate a PD Behavioural Model and construct reliable early PD symptoms detection alarms. To those identified and clinically validated as early stage PD patients, ICT-based interventions will be provided via the i-PROGNOSIS Intervention Platform, including: a) a Personalised Game Suite (ExerGames, DietaryGames, EmoGames, Handwriting\/VoiceGames) for physical\/emotional support, b) targeted nocturnal intervention to increase relaxation\/sleep quality and c) assistive interventions for voice enhancement and gait rhythm guidance.

With the Silent Sensors tyre management system we estimate between 2% and 6% fuel savings.\n\u2022Increased tyre life \u2013 by managing your tyres properly, you will achieve a significantly longer life for tyres. Spread over thousands of tyres used annually in a fleet, this leads to more money retained by the business.\n\u2022Much safer tyres \u2013 20% of road accidents are caused by tyre failures. When tyres are properly maintained by Silent Sensors systems, there are fewer failures, and much safer transport.\n\nSilent Sensors provides an efficient, easy tyre management system at a low cost using patented RFID technology. It measures tyre pressure, tread and temperature by simply applied sensors, allowing fleet owners to better manage one of their most vital resources. It is a precise, practical and world-leading system.\n\nThe skilled, experienced team behind Silent Sensors have brought the system to a point where trials are in progress with a large fleet truck business in the UK. The Phase 1 feasibility study will create an elaborated business case that should support the development and commercialisation of this solution, initially working with our UK trial partner, then trials in Scandinavia and India and eventual expansion to the remainder of Europe and Asia, specifically China.

No one likes an autonomous car that is doomed to a collision accident once every few years or months. In the real world, collision does happen at every second - more than 1.3 million people are killed by road accidents every single year. The current approaches for vehicle collision detection such as vehicle to vehicle communication, radar, laser based Lidar and GPS are far from acceptable in terms of reliability, cost, energy consumption and size. For example, radar is too sensitive to metallic material, Lidar is too expensive and it does not work well on absorbing\/reflective surfaces, GPS based methods are difficult in cities with high buildings, vehicle to vehicle communication cannot detect pedestrians or any objects unconnected, segmentation based vision methods are too computing power thirsty to be miniaturized, and normal vision sensors cannot cope with fog, rain and dim environment at night.

It takes the advantages of low cost spatial-temporal and parallel computing capacity of bio-inspired visual neural systems and multiple modalities data inputs in extracting potential collision cues at complex weather and lighting conditions.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0.9,"telecommunications":0.6,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0.8,"mobile phones":0.1,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.1,"data networks":0.2,"optical networks":0.1,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.2,"mobile radio":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.6,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: AMBER - AMBER - enhAnced Mobile BiomEtRics Abstract: Over recent years the ubiquity of mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets devices has rapidly increased. These devices provide a range of untethered interaction unimaginable a decade previously. With this ability to interact with services and individuals comes the need to accurately authenticate the identity of the person requesting the transaction many of which carry financial\/legally-binding instruction. Biometric solutions have also seen increased prominence over the past decade with large-scale implementations in areas such as passport and national ID systems. The adoption of specific biometric sensors by mobile vendors indicates a long-term strategy as a means of authentication. This adoption is is at critical point \u2013 users need to be confident of biometrics in terms of usability, privacy and performance; compromise in any one of these categories will lead to mistrust and a reluctance to adopt over and above conventional forms of authentication. The design, implementation and assessment of biometrics on mobile devices therefore requires a range of solutions to aid initial and continued adoption. The EU needs to have experts trained specifically in the field to ensure that it participates, competes and succeeds in the global market. \n\nAMBER comprises 11 partners with recognised expertise from across the EU. The specific objectives are to:\n\n\u2022 Address a range of current issues facing biometric solutions on mobile devices requiring timely research and development.\n\u2022 Collate Europe-wide complementary expertise to investigate these issues and provide a structure and environment to effectively facilitate training.\n\u2022 Train and equip the next generation of researchers to define, investigate and implement solutions, and provide transferable skills to enable effective planning, management and communication of research ideas and outcomes.\n\u2022 Develop solutions and theory to ensure secure, ubiquitous and efficient authentication whilst protecting privacy of citizen.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0.5,"WiFi":0.5,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: EOSC-Life - Providing an open collaborative space for digital biology in Europe Abstract: EOSC-Life brings together the 13  Biological and Medical ESFRI research infrastructures  (BMS RIs) to create an open collaborative space for digital biology.  It is our joint response to the challenge of analysing and reusing the prodigious amounts of data produced by life-science. Managing and integrating this data is beyond the capabilities of most individual end-users and institutes. By publishing data and tools in a Europe-wide cloud EOSC-Life aims to bring the capabilities of big science projects to the wider research community.  Federated user access (AAI) will allow transnational resource access and authorisation. EOSC-Life establishes a novel access model for the BMS RI: through EOSC scientists would gain direct access to FAIR data and tools in a cloud environment available throughout the European Research Area. \nEOSC-Life will make BMS RIs data resources FAIR and publish  them in the EOSC following guidelines and standards (e.g. EDMI). Overall this will drive the evolution of the RI repository infrastructure for EOSC and integration of the BMS RI repositories. EOSC-Life will implement workflows that cross disciplines and RI boundaries and address the needs of interdisciplinary science. Through open hackathons and bring-your-own-data events we will co-create  EOSC-Life  with our user communities , providing a blueprint for how the EOSC supports wide-spread and excellent data-driven life science research. EOSC-Life will address the data policies needed for human research data under GDPR. Interoperable provenance information describe history of sample and data to ensure reproducibility and adherence to regulatory requirements.\nThe goal of the EOSC-Life project is to make sure that life-scientists can find, access and integrate life-science data for analysis and reuse in academic and industrial research. EOSC-Life will transform European life-science by providing an open, continent-scale, collaborative and interdisciplinary environment for data science.","gt":["data networks"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.2,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

The resulting traffic accounts for about 12% of CO2 emissions. Delayed maintenance impairs road safety and increases cost of intervention, vehicle operating costs, and emissions.\nThe CROWD4ROADS project combines trip sharing and crowd sensing initiatives to harness collective intelligence to contribute\nto the solution of the sustainability issues of road passenger transport, by increasing the car occupancy rate and by\nengaging drivers and passengers in road monitoring.\nBlaBlaCar (http:\/\/blablacar.com\/) is the largest trusted ride sharing community worldwide, with more than 10.000.000\nmembers in 14 countries, while SmartRoadSense (http:\/\/smartroadsense.it\/) is a crowd sensing system which makes use of\nthe accelerometers of car-mounted smartphones to estimate the roughness of the road surface.\nThe CROWD4ROADS platform establishes a synergistic relationship between BlaBlaCar and SmartRoadSense, exploiting the network effect which is inherent in both the initiatives, to provide a sizeable impact in terms of car occupancy rate, road\nmonitoring, and end-user engagement in road maintenance and transport sustainability.\nScalability issues will be addressed during the project both from a technical and from a social point of view.

The Copernicus era has created a new market with the massive amounts of satellite data that the ground segments of space systems receive serve to the market and governmental bodies. A physical\/cyber-attack to their installations or communication networks, respectively, would cause debilitating impact on public safety and security of EU citizens and public authorities. A physical attack on a space ground segment makes the distribution of satellite data problematic and, on the other hand, a cyber-attack in its data storage, access and exchange affects not only the reliability of space data, but also their FAIR standards: findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Current approaches do not fully exploit the recent advances in surveillance mechanisms with robotic technologies and AI. 7SHIELD will be an integrated yet flexible and adaptable framework enabling the deployment of innovative services for cyber-physical protection of ground segments, such as e-fences, passive radars and laser technologies, multimedia AI technologies, that enhance their protection capabilities, while integrating or interoperating with existing protection solutions already deployed at their installations. The framework will integrate advanced technologies for data integration, processing, and analytics, machine learning and recommendation systems, data visualization and dashboards, data security and cyber threat protection. The technological solution is co-designed with first responders\u2019 teams and contributes to policy making, standardisation and new guidelines for contingency planning and service continuity.

{"text":"Title: LocationWise - LocationWise Payment Card Validation: A cloud based location verification system that will significantly lower cost of payment card cyber security Abstract: The vision of LocationWise project is to lower fraud costs incurred by banks from \u20ac1.03 to \u20ac0.55 per transaction and thus saving Europe ca. \u20ac456 million annually. Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. \u20ac1.44 billion annually and \u20ac14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to \u20ac13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user\u2019s mobile device to determine his\/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%.

{"text":"Title: SONNET - Self-OrganizatioN towards reduced cost and eNergy per bit for future Emerging radio Technologies Abstract: A revelation in today\u00b4s mobile is networks is SON (Self-Organizing technology) technology, which is seen as a playing pivotal role towards reducing the management costs of networks. In legacy networks, still many network elements and associated parameters are manually configured. The associated operations costs are significant. Specialized expertise must be maintained to tune these network parameters, and the existing manual process is time-consuming and potentially error-prone. In addition, this manual tuning process inherently results in comparatively long delays in updating values in response to the often rapidly changing network topologies and operating conditions, resulting in sub-optimal network performance. SON is capable of collecting information from the network, so as to perform self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing and etc, so as to reduce the operation cost through less human involvement, and to optimize the service quality through robust and prompt network optimization.   \n\nIn this proposal, we aim to drive further cost savings in the way networks are managed today by amplifying further the coverage zone of SON within the network. We believe that key technologies such as network sharing and Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) can benefit from SON technology solutions. We will consider a complex context-aware heterogeneous network that is slowly becoming a 5G reality, and investigate the notion of SON CoMP and SO network sharing, as key technologies to reduce cost and energy per bit in legacy and future emerging mobile technologies.","gt":["5G","radio technology"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.9,"4G":0.8,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: RADAR-CNS - Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse in Central Nervous System Disorders Abstract: Background: Long term conditions require monitoring of patients, traditionally conducted in the clinic, to monitor treatment effects, adverse events and disease course. This can be inefficient and cumbersome \u2013 clinic visits may be too infrequent to identify individuals at risk of significant changes in disease state (e.g. relapse) and place unnecessary burden on patients and providers.\n\nSmartphone and wearable technologies have led to an exponential growth in the amount of information which can be collected on patients unobtrusively and at low cost. Sensors collect data passively, and active monitoring, using experience sampling, provides information on multiple parameters. Such technologies could monitor long term outcomes of patients, at scale, and provide fine-grained information on outcomes, available in real time and at low-cost, enabling services to offer more responsive and efficient care. \n\nWhilst there is growing interest in the application of RMT in health, the field is in its infancy. The private-public partnership fostered by IMI2 is an ideal way to overcome the inherent challenges of this field.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through remote assessment. To achieve this we will create a pipeline for developing, testing and implementing RMT in depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. The pipeline will include a data management and modelling infrastructure applicable to other disorders and with the flexibility of design to be future-proofed against further technological innovation. We will provide data on implementation barriers and facilitators gleaned from patients, clinicians, regulator and payers which will optimise the pathways for regulatory approval and uptake. \n\nProgram of Work: In order to test the feasibility and predictive power of RMT four main components are required: (1) Excellent project oversight, management, and a dissemination and exploitation strategy;","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.6,"radar":0.9,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0.4,"WiFi":0.4,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.6,"mobile radio":0.6,"4G":0.4,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0.4,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: iNTACT - Commercialisation of the world\u2019s first iNTelligent Access Cover Technology for the protection of ALL underground infrastructure. Abstract: All infrastructure that underpins life as we know it runs underground in some form whether it be telecoms, water, gas or electricity. All underground infrastructure is only accessible through one method \u2013 inspection chambers. These inspection chambers are common and 100s can exist within a small area. To prevent criminal damage to infrastructure and ensure safety, all of these chambers are covered with access covers. There have been no major innovations of access covers in recent times and most remain completely unsecure and vulnerable. Requests to increase security has resulted in simple measures taken in the form of padlocks and key-locks, which still leave significant vulnerabilities. Alongside these vulnerabilities, covers in strategic sites need daily monitoring. This is currently done manually with physical inspections. There is a significant cost incurred for this.\n\nWe are Hugslock Systems and have developed a solution that will secure all underground infrastructure. We have created iNTelligent Access Cover Technology \u2018iNTACT\u2019 that will truly revolutionize the security of underground critical infrastructures. iNTACT is the world\u2019s first remote lockable access cover. It is secure, impenetrable and intelligent. Intelligence is embedded within the cover in the form of sensors that can offer various monitoring capabilities such as gas, heat, water sensors, Infrared CCTV, motion, bio-hazard and seismic.\n\niNTACT completely removes the need for any physical inspections, as the remote-operated locks can be remotely monitored from a central control room. We have strong market-pull from utility providers such as SITEL of the Czech Republic and organizations such the Ministry of Defence. Based on early interest we have built bottom-up 5 year forecasts to generate cumulative turnover of \u20ac28.9m to generate \u20ac15.1m PBIT. Based on total investments of \u20ac1.85m, this will achieve a ROI of 7.2:1 and payback on investment in 29.8 months.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: APACHE - Active & intelligent PAckaging materials and display cases as a tool for preventive conservation of Cultural Heritage. Abstract: Most Cultural Heritage objects housed by museums are often stored under unsuitable climate conditions. APACHE will develop a cutting edge technology to control and prevent the degradation of such patrimony. The novel approach is based on three pillars: 1) advanced sensing and absorbing materials to control the artifacts\u2019 environment; 2) modeling to define the threshold of artifacts\u2019 degradation and to discriminate between the need for preventive or remedial conservation; 3) remote control of the works of art stressors. The unique combination of these pillars will reduce to the lowest possible level the costs actually required by conventional technology for art conservation. New generation of active and intelligent display cases, crates, and storage boxes, will be implemented thanks to: i) The unique APACHE partnership, comprising the most important experts in the three aforementioned pillars; ii) The development of easy-to-use sensing devices able to communicate through Wireless Sensor Networks and Radio Frequency Identification Devices thanks to Industry 4.0-5.0 ICT technologies, granting the optimal environmental conditions around the art objects. Multiscale models integrated in an open simulation environment will be used to predict the degradation of artefacts and set the properties of sensors (detection limits) and polyfunctional absorbents. APACHE includes small, medium, and large museums exhibiting representative variety of display and storage conditions. For instance, the Venice Peggy Guggenheim Collection features one of the most important collections of modern\/contemporary art, which experiences highly unfavorable environmental conditions, difficult to control with conventional tools. Centre Pompidou and National Museum of Hungary possess a vast amount of artefacts stored in deposits (e.g. in crates and boxes).

{"text":"Title: UPDWMI - Ultra-low Power Digital circuits for Wireless Medical Implants Abstract: Advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to implant ultra-small electronic sensors in the human body. Interfacing with organs and nervous system, these devices will be a key part of future healthcare technologies. One of the most important components in such a device is the electronic integrated circuit (IC) located right at the signal source. This determines the overall power consumption and size of an implant. However, due to the need for sensitive analog circuits and toxicity concerns, very advanced silicon technology nodes (as in consumer electronics) cannot be used in such ICs. Hence, the power & area consumption is of significant concern. The primary aim of the project is to develop custom, novel ultra-low power digital cells for efficient signal processing and communication circuits for miniature wireless medical implants. This goal fits ideally with the ongoing IMPACT project (in the same group) that aims to develop rice-grain size bio-electronic sensor to monitor cancer tumors. This project will be able to use custom digital cells to optimize this tradeoff between data compression and transmission bandwidth in such a device. The researcher will  interact with a multidisciplinary team working on the IMPACT project,  including IC designers, physicist, biochemist and clinicians. The highly interdisciplinary work will consider the limitations of such an implant in terms of its sensor functionality and physiological acceptance before deriving the electrical specifications. The researcher will bring her extensive experience in designing low-power CMOS arithmetic and memory circuits to this project. This will complement the existing knowhow in bio-sensors and high-performance sensor interfaces already being developed at the host group.

These will empower them beyond the lifespan of this project to understand, help choose and successfully implement \u2018positive\u2019 evidence-based and cost-effective policy interventions, based on new and innovative mobility services, and in the context of already existing infrastructure, policy and measures. EMPOWER will reduce the use of CFV by: shifting trips to other modes\/other vehicle types, promoting sharing and self-organisation and reducing demand overall e.g. through remote access to services. Undesirable impacts from CFV use will be reduced by: shifting CFV use to outside peak times and diversions to avoid particular areas\/routes. The research will be multidisciplinary and involve: social science research with the public, 4 living lab experiments and 7 City demonstrators which will be chosen through an open 'bidding' process. The EMPOWER concept will be used in practice by: City stakeholders being able (through a software tool) to choose positive policy options based on their expected impacts and deliver incentives and social network sharing schemes to individuals using software. The innovation outputs of EMPOWER include an EMPOWER Toolkit to support industry, policy makers and employers to understand, choose and implement positive policy interventions. The Toolkit includes: new mobility services to provide innovative positive policy measures, new evidence on behavioural responses and impacts from positive incentives, improved organisational models for successful implementation of positive policy measures and innovation in the evaluation methodology for new mobility services.

{"text":"Title: LightPipe - Antiresonant Hollow Optical Fibres for a Quantum Leap in Data and Optical Power Transmission Abstract: Fibre optics has revolutionised telecommunications, enabled the widespread diffusion of the internet and profoundly impacted industrial manufacturing, metrology, medical endoscopy and structural sensing, to name but a few. In many applications however, fibres are now being operated very close to fundamental physical limits of the glass that forms their core, and this is already providing hard limits, for example, to the maximum data capacity or optical intensity that can be transmitted through them. A transformative new technological step is required to help increasing the information capacity and power delivery capability of optical fibres to keep up with the 1.5dB\/year growth in global data traffic and with the 2dB\/year raise in laser output power. Air guiding hollow core fibres can provide a natural solution, but the state of the art technology suffers from conceptual physical limitations that bound their minimum loss, maximum information capacity, and transmitted optical power and energy. This proposal addresses these global challenges by developing the \u2018ultimate\u2019 hollow core optical fibre technology based on nested antiresonant nodeless fibres. Based on a recent discovery of the PI yet to find experimental demonstration, these fibres exploit antiresonances and multiple coherent reflections from the glass membranes to achieve, unlike any other known air-guiding optical waveguide, simultaneous minimisation of surface scattering and leakage loss. By targeting a 10 times increase in data capacity and power handling and a 5 times reduction in transmission loss as compared to state-of-the-art technology, all in an ultra-low nonlinearity fibre with excellent modal purity and spectral transparency, the outcomes of this project have the potential to revolutionise telecommunications 45 years after the development of ultra-low loss glass optical fibres and to produce a step-change in many industrial and scientific high power laser delivery applications.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0.9,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.9,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

The total number of people suffering from dementia is projected to reach 82 million in 2030 and 152 million by 2050 \u2013 a 3-fold increase. This puts tremendous pressure on the healthcare system and society as a whole. Equally important, dementia is overwhelming for patients' families and their carers, as they require full-time care and watch. For all these reasons it timely and imperative to develop a low-cost and efficient full-time health monitoring solution.\n\nThe goal of this research is to develop an unobtrusive system Suite (ViSionRF) that will be able to capture the vital physiological signals of users (breathing, heart rate, heart beat shape, body position), remotely by using low-power radar, Wi-Fi and RFID signal technologies.  Envision a home with a single remote and unobtrusive device that acts as a stethoscope, heart monitor, irregular breath detector, and posture sensor. Such a home would have the ability to monitor your breathing, your heart (rate and pulse shape), and your position and alert your doctor when an emergency occurs. Such a home would help tremendously impaired citizens (e.g. dementia patients) and their carers.\n\nUnlike traditional patient monitoring systems that require users to \u2018wear\u2019 devices and sensors, the proposed system does not require wearing any wearable electronic or on-body sensor. This maximizes mobility and makes the system completely transparent to the user. This is important as dementia sufferers repeatedly forget or decline to \u2018wear\u2019 their sensors.

E2V designs, manufactures, supplies to the space market these essential components, but faces keen competition from US providers. To preserve know-how and production of such competitive components in Europe and to underscore its efforts for non-dependence, the industrial consortium proposes to develop two new data converters and to mature them to TRL6. A four-channel ADC, sampling at up to 6 GSPs offers ultra-wide input bandwidth, flexibility and high-speed serial outputs. A multi-channel DAC, reconstructing at up to 6 GSPs offers multi-Nyquist output bandwidth, configurable modes and high-speed serial inputs. Using a European semiconductor technology, the new converters shall target performances beyond today\u2019s state-of-the-art to ensure their competitiveness by their delivery dates. Such devices facilitate innovative Rx-to-Tx signal chain solutions for satellite telecommunications, earth observation, navigation and scientific missions.

The project will look into analysing, developing, implementing and testing cognitive radio algorithms. The ground breaking element in SCREEN is however the implementation and testing. Even though some of the underlying technologies for the individual stages are not novel, the incorporation of all stages in a radio transceiver has never been done to the full extent of a cognitive, and not adaptive, system.\n\nThe key enabling technology for cognitive radio is Software-Defined Radio (SDR), which provides the required flexibility to reconfigure the radio parameters autonomously and without any changes in the transceiver hardware. The Consortium will make use of proprietary SDR technology and use it for the implementation and testing. In fact, the project approach is to make use of terrestrial research results in cognitive radio at all levels (technological, market and regulatory) and capitalise the previous work done in different projects, avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts. The target spectrum band for this project is S-band, which is underexplored and has a strong potential for future niche applications both in satcom and in ISLs for multi-satellite missions. It also brings advantages regarding regulatory concerns.\n\nThis project clearly fits the topic, not only because its main goal is to evolve an innovative technology up to TRL4\/5, but also because cognitive radio is a key enabling technology for the areas identified by the topic. This technology will lead to a new generation of satcom payloads and also have massive impact on ISLs and downlink subsystems.

Computation at the network edge is key to supporting many emerging applications, from extended reality to smart health, smart cities, smart factories and autonomous driving. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is being developed to deliver the required computation functionalities closer to user devices, directly at mobile access points. GREENEDGE is motivated by the fact that the large scale adoption of MEC technology, while benefiting human productivity and efficiency, will result in a surge of data and computation in mobile networks, which, in turn, will exacerbate their energy consumption. GREENEDGE is set out to tame the growing carbon footprint of MEC technology, devising highly energy efficient communication and computing functionalities for the network edge, combining them with ambient energy sources and with new energy storage and supply paradigms. As a result, GREENEDGE technology will allow mobile systems to offer the much anticipated communication and computing services in a sustainable manner. Fifteen early stage researchers (ESRs) will be trained by a consortium of world-class leaders across the fields of energy harvesting, storage, edge computing, optimization, machine learning and wireless communications. Ample inter-sectoral opportunities will be offered thanks to secondments among academy\/research centers, two network operators, and other prominent industrial partners operating in the domains of Internet of Things, smart cities, critical infrastructure management and data analytics.

This will help the pipeline operators to take preventive and corrective measures before any accident stemmed from pipeline failure occurs.  A low profile wireless Acoustic Emission (AE) and Long Range Ultrasonic (LRU) dual mode sensors will be permanently attached on the pipeline with a collar installed 100m apart from each other that can monitor 50m of pipeline in either side. The sensors will act in passive AE mode in normal operation and on detection of an anomaly will switch to LRU mode to locate and determine the characteristics of the anomaly. An artificial neural network (ANN) and data fusion system will intelligently manage data acquisition and analysis functions based on data received from the installed sensor nodes.

More precisely, we aim at showing a substantial quantum-enhancement in several fundamental tasks: (1) the readout of classical data from digital memories (quantum reading); (2) the recognition of classical patterns (quantum pattern recognition); (3) the optical measurement of concentration in fragile biomedical samples (quantum bio-probing); and (4) the microwave detection of target objects (microwave quantum illumination or quantum radar). These objectives are realized starting from the optimization of a general theoretical model at their basis: quantum channel discrimination. This is then developed into technical aspects which directly support our experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations.\n\nOur experimental prototypes could open the way to much more powerful and radically new forms of information and detection technologies, with direct benefit for science and the wider society. Thanks to the superior performances in the low energy regime, quantum reading may increase data-transfer rates and storage capacities of current digital memories by orders of magnitude. Quantum pattern recognition could have remarkable long-term applications in biology and medicine, in terms of non-invasive analysis of very fragile biological samples or human tissues, and better recognizing hidden patterns associated to bacterial growths or cancerous cells.

{"text":"Title: MetaVEH - Metamaterial Enabled Vibration Energy Harvesting Abstract: Increasing demand for fully autonomous wireless sensors to service the emerging technologies of the internet of things, remote and real time monitoring of vulnerable environments or self-sensing smart structures is driving a requirement for efficient and novel methods of energy harvesting. The sensor's data communication has a substantial power requirement that presents a serious constraint upon the number of sensors, and their capability. Our primary aim is to realise innovative Lead-free electromechanical energy harvesters; these will be easily installed, to power, in a clean and low-cost manner, autonomous wireless sensing devices thereby eliminating batteries and human intervention: This will revolutionise sensor applications whilst simultaneously reducing chemical waste. This is timely as in current solutions battery replacement is either logistically impossible or too expensive and batteries carry a toxic chemical cost. Solar panels have the environmental drawback of using toxic materials. In our vision of future sensor technology, with our vibration energy harvesters (VEH) as their primary power source, a battery, will become unnecessary, and their associated chemical waste will no longer occur, and these sensors will become truly autonomous. The harvester's mechanical core will draw on advanced multiresonator designs, integrating Lead-free piezoelectric patches enhanced by the unique wave control capacities of resonant elastic metamaterials. Currently microVEH, though promising, suffers due to frequency mismatch: We have the ambition to bridge the gap between different scales by leveraging the potential of metamaterials. This will dramatically increase the energy available for harvesting, and operational bandwidth.

{"text":"Title: CNT-QUBIT - Carbon Nanotube Quantum Circuits Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to use spin qubits defined in carbon nanotube quantum dots to demonstrate measurement-based entanglement in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture. The project makes use of spin-orbit interaction to drive spin rotations in the carbon nanotube host system and hyperfine interaction to store quantum information in the nuclear spin states. The proposal builds on techniques developed by the principal investigator for fast and non-invasive read-out of the electron spin qubits using radio-frequency reflectometry and spin-to-charge conversion.\n\nAny quantum computer requires entanglement. One route to achieve entanglement between electron spin qubits in quantum dots is to use the direct interaction of neighbouring qubits due to their electron wavefunction overlap. This approach, however, becomes rapidly impractical for any large scale quantum processor, as distant qubits can only be entangled through the use of qubits in between. Here I propose an alternative strategy which makes use of an intriguing quantum mechanical effect by which two spatially separated spin qubits coupled to a single electrical resonator become entangled if a measurement cannot tell them apart.\n\nThe quantum information encoded in the entangled electron spin qubits will be transferred to carbon-13 nuclear spins which are used as a quantum memory with coherence times that exceed seconds. Entanglement with further qubits then proceeds again via projective measurements of the electron spin qubits without risk of losing the existing entanglement. When entanglement of the electron spin qubits is heralded \u2013 which might take several attempts \u2013 the quantum information is transferred again to the nuclear spin states. This allows for the coupling of large numbers of physically separated qubits, building up so-called graph or cluster states in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: BRISRES - The Basal Roughness of Ice Sheets from Radio-Echo Sounding Abstract: The subglacial environment beneath the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the physically least well characterised environments on Earth. Ice sheet model simulations demonstrate high sensitivity to their basal sliding parameterisation which is governed by basal roughness, the thermal state of the bed, and lithology (presence or absence or deformable sediments). Compiling observations of the current state of the glacier bed is therefore crucial for the accuracy of ice sheet modelling and future predictions of sea level change. Radio-echo sounding (RES) is the only existing geophysical technique that has sufficient data coverage to enable ice-sheet-wide information to be obtained from the bed. In general, however, quantitative analysis of radar sounding data, and integration with electromagnetic and geostatistical approaches, lags significantly behind the data availability.\n         In this fellowship I will develop an integrated framework for characterising the roughness of glacier beds; exploiting information from the electromagnetic scattering of the radar pulse and the statistics of the basal topography. This approach will enable an unprecedented characterisation of the scale dependence of basal roughness from the kilometre to the metre scale - the scale that is most relevant for basal sliding.  Via a synthesis with ice sheet models I will challenge assumptions that are made regarding basal roughness and its relationship with other geophysical data fields, enabling new radar-derived constraints to be placed upon the bed of ice sheets. Subsidiary goals include: adapting electromagnetic scattering models for fractal surfaces to ice penetrating radar; identifying and mapping regions of deformable bed; and developing a framework for combining electromagnetic scattering information from different radar systems. This fellowship represents a unique opportunity to transfer knowledge and techniques from the US geophysical radar community to European glaciology.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"radar":1.0,"radio frequency":1.0,"radio technology":1.0,"microwave technology":0.8,"radio and television":0.6,"satellite radio":0.5,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

This is a wake up call for manufacturers and operators to provide users with ubiquitous, high speed and high quality wireless coverage. The 5G cell densification is the only available route due to the constraints of sub-6GHz networks. A dense deployment of small cells requires a capillary backhaul and novel approaches to fronthaul. While the increase of data rate at small cell level has found solutions, the quest for high-density backhaul remains still unanswered. The fiber is too expensive and of difficult deployment. The wireless backhaul is the preferred solution for operators for performance, flexibility and cost. The traffic demand requires an upshift from microwave to high capacity millimeter wave backhaul, and overcome the current technology limits. ULTRAWAVE responds to the challenge of high capacity, high cell density backhaul by proposing, for the first time, the exploitation of the whole millimeter wave spectrum beyond 100 GHz. This will be used to create an ultra capacity layer providing more than 100 Gbps per kilometer square in Point to Multi point at D-band (141 \u2013 174.8 GHz) over 500 m radius of coverage, fed by novel G-band (300 GHz) Point to Point high capacity links with more than 600 m range.

The forward-looking FUDGE-5G architecture will also feature \u201call-Ethernet\u201d 5GLAN (Local Area Network), 5G-TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking), 5G-Multicast and intelligent vertical application orchestration features. The proposed framework enables highly customized cloud-native deployment of private 5G networks. FUDGE-5G will accelerate the (inevitable) shift to a fully software-based 5G core network by offering a disintegrated environment where components, both in control and user plane, can be deployed anywhere as micro-services (i.e., edge, on premises and cloud), being agnostic to the underlying infrastructure. This softwarization exposing 5G NR HW to third parties will enable the usage of off-the-shelf commodity HW to deliver additional cost savings, faster deployments and ultimately greater adoption for private networks. The consortium has been carefully built around several innovative high-tech small and medium European vendors for virtualized 5GC and service orchestration solutions and applications. They will be able to integrate, test and validate their 5G technical solutions over the premium end-to-end 5G NR facility provided by a major European MNO in several innovative use cases for private networks under real-life operational conditions with prominent vertical stakeholders. State-of-the-art eSBA capabilities will be offered by large vendors.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.7,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}
{"text":"Title: MITIGATE - Multidimensional, IntegraTed, rIsk assessment framework and dynamic, collaborative Risk ManaGement tools for critical information infrAstrucTurEs Abstract: Despite the importance of Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) and dynamic ICT-based maritime supply chains (SCs) for port operations, state-of-the-art Risk Management (RM) methodologies for maritime environments pay limited attention to cyber-security and do not adequately address security processes for international SCs. Motivated by these limitations, MITIGATE will introduce, integrate, validate and commercialize a novel RM system, which will empower stakeholders\u2019 collaboration for the identification, assessment and mitigation of risks associated with cyber-security assets and SC processes. This collaborative system will boost transparency in risk handling, while enabling the generation of unique evidence about risk assessment and mitigation. At the heart of the RM system will be an open simulation environment enabling stakeholders to simulate risks and evaluate risk mitigation actions. This environment will allow users to model, design, execute and analyze attack-oriented simulations. Emphasis will be paid on the estimation of cascading effects in SCs, as well as on the prediction of future risks. MITIGATE will be compliant with prominent security standards and regulations for the maritime sector (i.e. ISO27000, ISO28000, ISPS).\nThe MITIGATE system will be built based on readily available technologies of the partners, which will enable the project to produce a mature (high-TRL) system at an optimal value-for-money. The system will be validated based on real-life pilot operations across five EU ports (Bremen, Piraeus, Valencia, Ravenna, Livorno) with the active participation of over 500 users (security officers, terminal operators, facility operators, standardization experts and more). Also, the project\u2019s approach will be contributed as a blueprint to the NIS public-private platform. Finally, significant effort will be devoted to the commercialization of the MITIGATE system based on pragmatic business plans and market launch actions.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.7,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: HetScaleNet - Analysis and control of large scale heterogeneous networks: scalability, robustness and fundamental limits Abstract: The proposed research will make a contribution towards the analysis and synthesis of large scale complex networks: fundamental theory will be developed and important applications will be addressed, by extending tools from control theory. Networks are present throughout the physical and biological world, but nowadays they also pervade our societies and everyday lives. Major challenges that will be addressed are:\n\nI. The engineering of large scale heterogeneous networks that are guaranteed to be robust and scalable. \n\nII. The reverse engineering of biological networks.\n\nA distinctive feature of the networks we would like to engineer, which falls outside more traditional domains in systems and control, is that of scalability, i.e. the ability to guarantee robust stability for an arbitrary interconnection by conditions on only local interactions. The methodologies that will be developed will have a significant impact in various applications where scalability is important, such as data network protocols, group coordination problems and power distribution networks, as they can lead to network designs with guaranteed robustness, thus avoiding conservative schemes with poor performance. The proposed project will also make a contribution towards the reverse engineering of biological networks at the molecular level. Life in the cell is dictated by chance; noise is ubiquitous with its sources ranging from fluctuating environments to intrinsic fluctuations due to the random births and deaths of molecules. The fact that a substantial part of the noise is intrinsic provides a major challenge in control theoretic methodologies. How can feedback be used to suppress these fluctuations, what are the associated tradeoffs and limitations, and how does nature manage to handle these so efficiently? These are questions that will be addressed by developing tools for analyzing known configurations, but more importantly, by deriving fundamental limitations that hold for arbitrary feedback.","gt":["data networks"],"preds":{"teleology":0.0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.0,"radar":0.0,"mobile phones":0.0,"bluetooth":0.0,"WiFi":0.0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0.0,"microwave technology":0.0,"radio technology":0.0,"mobile radio":0.0,"4G":0.0,"LiFi":0.0,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0.0,"satellite radio":0.0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: iBoard - Large scale interactive multi-touch displays Abstract: There is currently an established worldwide market worth annually more than $2 billion for interactive whiteboards. These whiteboards are mainly used in schools and other educational establishments. The end-users expect that a new generation of interactive whiteboards will support multi-touch finger input, yet current touch sensing solutions, while adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a large display, are striving to meet the technical specification for multi-touch interfaces. Our technology will disrupt this existing market. Alterix has invented a novel, highly efficient and low-cost electronic solution for measuring touch inputs.  By achieving a hundred-fold increase in the measurement speed compared to the touch interfaces commonly used in tablets and mobile phones, our technology scales easily to large displays with  diagonal sizes up to 250cm and is compatible with interactive whiteboards and flat-panel TVs. To serve the educational market the cost of interactive transparent TV display overlays must be reduced by replacing the indium \u2013 a critical raw material in short supply - which otherwise would be used to build the transparent sensor grid. To achieve this goal Alterix is transferring the inexpensive technology for making laminated ultrafine (nearly invisible) wires developed in the last decade for heating the windscreens of modern cars.  \n\nIt is now of strategic importance for Alterix to study the feasibility of establishing a functional supply chain, preferably within Germany and Portugal, for manufacturing TV display overlays and interactive whiteboards at the affordable cost point, validate possible issues with the manufacturing yields caused by novel aspects of the integration of large area electronics, and to articulate the company\u2019s commercialisation plans.

The EPIC concept and methodology is shaped by the key finding that routine progress in silicon technology in the next decade will not be sufficient to allow FEC implementations to break the Tb\/s barrier; Tb\/s FEC will require not only help from silicon technology but also major innovations in FEC algorithm design and implementation domains. A key EPIC objective is therefore to develop and utilize a disruptive FEC design framework that considers the FEC algorithm design and corresponding silicon implementation architectures in a unified fashion. Through such an integrated approach, EPIC aims to advance state-of-the-art FEC schemes (mainly Turbo, LDPC and Polar codes) to obtain the principal channel codes for beyond-5G (B5G) use-cases. Top-performing solutions developed under EPIC will be validated by virtual silicon tape-out implementations, thus providing first-in-class FEC blocks of wireless Tb\/s technology.

The network is interdisciplinary, intersectoral, unconventional and ambitious. It is unconventional in the sense that it connects stakeholders from seemingly separately developed fields: computational harmonic analysis, numerical linear algebra, computer algebra, nonlinear approximation theory, digital signal processing and their applications, in one and more variables. It is ambitious because the consortium stretches from mathematics to computational science and engineering and industry.  Multi-exponential analysis might sound remote, but it touches our daily lives in many surprising ways, even if most people are unaware of how important it is. For example, a substantial amount of effort in signal processing and time series analysis is essentially dedicated to the analysis of multi-exponential functions. Multi-exponential analysis is also fundamental to several research fields and application domains that are the subject of the EXPOWER proposal: remote sensing, antenna design, digital imaging, testing and metrology, all impacting some major societal or industrial challenges such as energy, transportation, space research, health and telecommunications.  The EXPOWER Beneficiaries and Third Country Partners, each bringing in their own complementary expertise, aim at solving some core challenges where the different domains involved with multi-exponential analysis meet.

{"text":"Title: FloatMastBlue - Offshore Wind Energy Cost Reduction by an Innovative Floating Met Mast Platform Abstract: FloatMast is a floating platform that performs the best wind data measurements for the most promising and advanced Blue Energy activity, Offshore Wind Parks (OWPs). These wind measurements are vital for the cost benefit analysis of OWPs as they are used in the estimation of the annual income. Moreover, the wind measurements are also critical to the definition of the Operation and Maintenance costs as they are used in the design specification of the OWP\u2019s turbines, towers and foundations. The wind measurements collected by FloatMast are according to the highest industry standard (IEC 61400-12-1) and provide the greatest net benefit to the Developers of OWPs. It can perform wind measurements at a 70% lower cost, by combining the best features from the two existing solutions: the meteorological mast and the Lidar remote sensor device on a stable floating platform. Furthermore, it is re-usable and provides the added value of being re-deployed in other locations of interest. It can be used at all stages of the life cycle of the OWP, from the design phase to the development and operational phase and until the decommissioning phase, twenty years later. Moreover, the platform can perform multi-purpose measurements as it can incorporate oceanographic instruments and environmental sensors, providing a fully integrated solution for a complete monitoring of the OWP site. The innovation has been developed by two Greek SMEs, it has been patented and certified,  tested in a tank test at a 1:25 scale model, constructed at 1:1 physical scale, launched to the sea and conducted a series of tests with perfect compliance. The design and hydrodynamic behavior of the platform have been proven and the next stage involves enhancements and upgrades. Finally, the platform must undergo a demonstration phase in the operational environment in order to provide the needed verification of its operational capabilities and advance the already 2,3 m Euros investment to the commercialization phase.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: seQureNet - Secure information processing in quantum networks Abstract: The promise of future quantum computers to substantially speed up computations has been advertised widely since the early days of the field. But there is a novel and fundamental aspect of devices based on quantum-mechanical principles that has just started to be explored: Quantum computers can preserve the privacy of computations. This aspect is a distinct new advantage of quantum computers over their classical counterparts. An entire class of unprecedented computations becomes feasible, in which the user data and the whole computation remain perfectly private \u2013 a feature impossible to achieve with classical computers. The main focus of this project is to exploit this feature and to implement secure photonic quantum information processing in distributed quantum networks. These networks consist of clients and small-scale quantum computers connected by communication channels. Photons are chosen as they are the ideal carriers for sending information over long distances. The clients can securely delegate computations to the quantum computers, such that neither the data nor the computation is revealed to the computers or any potential eavesdropper. The project will, first, elucidate how quantum resources boost the security of classical computations; second, demonstrate secure quantum computations over long distances and study their verification; and third, examine practical security aspects of implementations. The research will leverage the experimental state-of-the-art by adapting new photonic quantum technologies such as integrated photon sources and waveguide quantum circuits. Moreover, highly-efficient superconducting detectors will be applied to achieve excellent quantum control of the photons. This research is highly innovative and will be pivotal in the researcher\u2019s career development and for becoming an independent research group leader, as it enables acquiring both key scientific knowledge and developing complementary skills.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0.9,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.8,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: PANBioRA - Personalized And\/Or Generalized Integrated Biomaterial Risk Assessment Abstract: PANBioRA aims at providing a comprehensive solution for the time- and cost-effective risk assessment of i) new biomaterials under health or disease states or ii) a given biomaterial for each patient in a personalized manner. It will standardize the evaluation of biomaterials and open the venue for pre-implantation, personalized diagnostics for biomaterial based applications.   \nPANBioRA will provide a modular platform to assess risks at different aspects and length scales. This comprises antibody response, cytotoxicity\/genotoxicity at cell level, systemic and local effects at tissue and connected tissues (organ-on-a-chip) level. Moreover, physicochemical and biomechanical characterisation as well as predictive modelling at systems level will complement the system. This will be achieved by connecting testing modules in a structure supported by web-based modelling and risk radar tools together with a biomechanical testing system.\nThe platform will incorporate standardized protocols yielding significantly more information than the current methods for biomaterial risk assessment. Its accuracy will be demonstrated using known reference materials and validated in a pre-clinical setting.\nPANBioRA will for the first time, predict the patient specific response to a given biomaterial before its implantation. This measure will allow for the selection of the best suitable material, minimizing side effects and improving health outcomes. \nIt will also accelerate the process of validation of the biocompatibility of new devices by providing an automated, comprehensive process for the parallel assessment of risks at different scales aiding new biomaterial discovery and commercialisation. \nAltogether, PANBioRA will lead to a substantial economic impact due to a reduction of the amount of tests, decrease in healthcare costs due to complications. It will provide the necessary tools proper risk management related to biomaterials.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0.8,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
