{"text":"Title: interACT - Designing cooperative interaction of automated vehicles with other road users in mixed traffic environments Abstract: There is currently a high desire by manufacturers to introduce Automated Vehicles (AVs), SAE level 3 and above, to the market. As AVs are likely to be deployed in mixed traffic, they need to interact safely and efficiently with other (non-equipped) users, including manually driven vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. Although obstacle detection by AVs is almost flawless, these vehicles cannot communicate their intentions to other road users. This limitation currently reduces their appeal and value to the user. To ensure intuitive and cooperative interaction between the AV and others, and a smooth flow of all traffic, it is essential that there is good means of communication between all actors. The main objective of interACT is to substantially improve this communication and cooperation strategy. interACT will provide an overview of current human-machine interactions in mixed traffic, and increase chances of safe deployment of AVs by developing novel software and HMI hardware components for reliable and user-centric communication between an AV with its users. interACT will: \n1) Use social-psychological models to compile a catalogue of interactions, identifying the main communication needs of road users in current and future traffic scenarios \n2) Improve software algorithms and sensor capabilities for assessing intention recognition and behaviour prediction of surrounding road users \n3) Use a Cooperation and Communication Planning Unit to integrate planning algorithms, providing synchronized and integrated communication protocols \n4) Ensure safety of road users by developing easy-to-verify software for a safety layer, and novel methods for fail-safe trajectory planning. \nPrototypes will be developed and evaluated in multi-actor simulators and two test vehicles, assessing ease-of-use, acceptance, safety and reliability. The impact of this successful communication on reduction of crashes, improvement of traffic flow and acceptance of AVs by society will be investigated.","gt":["radar","mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.2,"radar":0.3,"mobile phones":0.4,"bluetooth":0.2,"WiFi":0.2,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: 5GCITY - 5GCITY Abstract: Delivering on the 5G promise of increased data rates, and ubiquitous coverages, poses stringent requirements on traditional vertically integrated operators. In particular, telecom operators are expected to massively  roll out Small Cells, which requires finding appropriate urban spaces with both backhaul and energy availability. Network sharing becomes essential to unlock those commercial massive deployments. The open access model, or neutral host, will come to play a key role on the deployment of 5G networks, especially in urban scenarios where very dense Small Cell deploymens are required. \nIn parallel recent trends are paving the way towards the development of new, heterogeneous and distributed cloud paradigms that significantly differ from today\u2019s established cloud model: with edge computing, cloud architectures are pushed all the way to the edge of the network, close to the devices that produce and act on data. We posit that there are two sets of players perfectly poised to take advantage of both trends since they already own the infrastructure needed to build edge deployments: telecommunication providers and municipalities. 5GCity focuses on how common smart city infrastructure (i.e.,small cells and processing power at the very edge of networks) can bring benefit to both players based on resource sharing and end-to-end virtualization, pushing the cloud model to the extreme edge. \n5GCity will design, develop, deploy and demonstrate a distributed cloud and radio platform for municipalities and infrastructure owners acting as 5G neutral hosts. 5GCity\u2019s main aim is to build and deploy a common, multi-tenant, open platform that extends the (centralized) cloud model to the extreme edge of the network, with a demonstration in three different cities (Barcelona, Bristol and Lucca). 5GCity will directly impact a large and varied range of actors: (i) telecom providers; (ii) municipalities; and (iii) a number of different vertical sectors utilizing the city infrastructure","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.9,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.9,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}

However, exploring such networks usually engages substantial computational resources requiring specific programing skills and dedicated facilities. In our main project NETSIGNAL, we have developed computational environment ARACHNE aiming to facilitate high-end neural network exploration among scientific and industrial users. ARACHNE enables an investigator to construct and explore cellular networks of arbitrary biophysical and architectural complexity using a simple interface on a local computer or a mobile device. Through small-file exchange via the internet, the interface controls a pre-configured computational kernel installed on a remote computer cluster or cloud. Uniquely, ARACHNE can integrate traditional wired network connections with diffuse, volume-transmitted type of inter-cellular signalling, to reflect the emerging role of glia in brain processing. ARACHNE thus affords a flexible neural network design and incorporates latest advances in neuroscience while providing a portable console suitable for IT-untrained explorers. ARACHNE has passed a feasibility and novelty test by independent experts (Aleksin et al, PLoS Comp Biology 2017, in press), its test version is available on-line (https:\/\/github.com\/LeonidSavtchenko\/Arachne\/).

Owing to growing underwater activities, e.g., undersea oil & gas exploration, and Internet of underwater things, reliable water-to-air wireless communications are urgently needed by the industry, military, and scientific communities. As it is difficult to use a single type of signal, e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), or optical, for communication across a water-air interface, most existing water-to-air communications rely on sonobuoys to relay acoustic signals from underwater transmitters to RF receivers on\/above the water surface. The global sonobuoy market is predicted to reach $595.9 million at a 6.62% CAGR over the period 2018-2023. Since sonobuoys might not be recovered from remote, hostile areas of the ocean, battery-powered sonobuoys (which have battery packs full of toxic metals) are posing a great threat to the marine environment. Although energy-harvesting technologies (e.g., photovoltaic, wave action, or seawater based semi-fuel cell) have been developed for sonobuoys to charge onboard energy storage systems, the challenge of miniaturizing and incorporating these technologies into the sonobuoy volume constraint remains a dominant issue. \nThis project will develop novel water-to-air backscatter communication (WABCom) technology to enable the design of lightweight, battery-free sonobuoys by leveraging RF backscatter communications, where the RF energy harvested by the sonobuoy from an unmanned aerial vehicle\u2019s (UAV) transmission is used to support the circuit operation at the sonobuoy, and the sonobuoy forwards the received underwater signal to the UAV via an RF backscatter link (i.e., by modulating the signal on the RF waveform reflected back to the UAV).

{"text":"Title: INSTINCT - Inhibiting Stress in the Construction Industry Abstract: Work-related stress is costing the UK economy about 10 million man-hours and \u20ac16 billion. An intervention to curb the advent of stress is proposed: \u2018Stress-Blocker\u2019 (Streblo). Cognitive psychology identifies five main personalities (Big-5): extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness. How these Big-5 differ in the dynamics of stress are unexplored, particularly in the field of construction where stress is also prevalent. Behavioural science explains differences in the coping abilities of people. Thus Part A of the study is an empirical investigation of the impacts of stressors on the Big-5 and their different coping behaviours. Data from at least 1500 UK construction personnel will be collected using a questionnaire, and analysed using multiple inferential statistical techniques: hierarchical regression, factor analysis and sequential equation modelling. The findings will then inform Part B: the development of Streblo, a cloud-based IT tool for the effective recognition and deterrence of stress. Streblo will operate on artificial intelligence and its initial simulation will be carried out using of the WEKA software. Data from 1200 respondents will be used to train Streblo while the remaining 300 pseudo responses will be used to pilot (validate) the performance of the product. Streblo will also be validated with the partner organisations and project managers, through focus group meetings which will be recorded, transcribed and analysed using the \u2018Nvivo\u2019 software. Streblo will then be launched as a simple, quick-to-use and free IT app which will be accessible on mobile devices, PCs and laptops. Streblo will exploit advanced technologies to prevent stress in different construction job profiles as well as other sectors of the economy. It will be the first worldwide integrated system that is based on personality profiling and associated coping skills to empower individuals to manage event-related stress in the context of their job roles.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: COHERENT - Coordinated control and spectrum management for 5G heterogeneous radio access networks Abstract: The exponential growth of mobile traffic, drastically increasing of network complexity, and the strong need for inter-network coordination of wireless network resources call for breakthroughs in control, coordination and flexible spectrum management  in 5G heterogeneous radio access networks. The COHERENT project aims to address these problems by researching, developing and validating a novel control framework for future mobile networks. The key innovation of COHERENT is to develop a unified programmable control framework to coordinate the underlying heterogeneous mobile networks as a whole. The COHERENT control framework has two unique features to deal with the insufficiency of current control solutions for inter-network coordination. First, theories and methods to abstract the low layer network states and behaviors of different underlying mobile networks are developed, which provides a simplified but sufficient abstracted network view for network-wide control and resource coordination. Network abstraction will significantly reduce the signaling overhead, making scalable network-wide control solutions feasible, and enable more flexible spectrum management, which are key for the success of 5G networks. Second, based on the abstracted network view, common interfaces and software-development kits will be developed to enable programmability in controlling and coordinating heterogeneous mobile networks. The programmable control will provide operators a flexible and cost efficient way to implement new control functions and thus to support new services. The innovative impact of the COHERENT project is in enabling a unified control and coordination framework for heterogeneous mobile networks by combining innovative approaches on abstraction of low layers in underlying mobile networks, software defined networking, and flexible spectrum management.

If even one of the parts fails the controls won\u2019t work and car models could be recalled by the factory to have to fix the issue. The assembled components are difficult to take apart and need to go through a timely, costly process to be recycled and not be turned into e-waste. The main problem behind in-car controls are that they cause significant distractions to drivers which has been found the cause of 80% of road traffic accidents. The problem is only becoming worse with infotainment displays imbedded with multiple lights and sensors and controls being inputted through a large touch-screen device.\nTangi0 have developed a new method for operating controls in the cockpit of cars through an intuitive, tactile material with distinctive shapes that allow drivers to operate it eye-free.

{"text":"Title: LPGPU2 - Low-Power Parallel Computing on GPUs 2 Abstract: Low-power GPUs have become ubiquitous, they can be found in domains ranging from wearable and mobile computing, to automotive systems. With this ubiquity has come a wider range of applications exploiting low-power GPUs, placing ever increasing demands on the expected performance and power efficiency of the devices.  Future low-power system-on-chips will have to provide higher performance and be able to support more complex applications, without using any additional power.\n\nThe strict power limitations means that these demands cannot be met through hardware improvements alone, however, but the software must better exploit the available resources.  Unfortunately, programmers are hindered when creating low-power GPU software by the quality of current performance analysis tools.  In low-power GPU contexts there is only a minimal amount of performance information, and essentially no power information, available to the programmer.  As software becomes more complex it becomes increasingly unmanageable for programmers to optimise the software for low-power devices.\n\nThis project proposes to aid the programmer in creating software for low-power GPUs by building on the results of the first LPGPU project to provide a complete performance analysis process for the programmer.  This project will address all aspects of performance analysis, from hardware power and performance counters, to a toolchain that processes and visualises information from these counters, to applications that will be used as use-cases to drive the entire design.  To access the new hardware performance counters a standardisable API will be produced to interface to a prototype hardware implementation.

{"text":"Title: ComRad - Combining MIMO Radar with MU-MIMO Communications: More than Coexistence (ComRad) Abstract: Frequency spectrum has nowadays become one of the most valuable assets, as the wireless communications devices and services are growing explosively. Realising the scarcity of the spectrum, future wireless systems are exploring the feasibility to use the spectrum that is currently occupied by radar systems, such as 3.4GHz and 5.6GHz bands used by airborne and shipborne radars. With the allocation of available spectrum to newer communication technologies, the interference in radar bands is on the rise consequently. Therefore, effective interference management approaches are needed for achieving the spectral coexistence between the current radar and communication services. More fundamentally, dual-functional systems that can simultaneously perform remote sensing and transmit useful information via classical communications could be an essential solution in the future, which not only ensures the spectral coexistence but also the improvement for both radar and communication\u2019s performance. The goal of ComRad is to develop novel signal processing techniques for transmit and receive beamforming, waveform design, signal classification\/recognition, and channel estimation, to enable the exploitation of radar spectrum for communication applications, with particular focus on 1) coexisting communication and radar systems (C-ComRad), and 2) Dual-functional Communication-Radar Systems (D-ComRad). The main research approaches that will be employed include the cutting-age concepts of interference exploitation, manifold based optimization and machine learning. The research outputs will have a significant impact on the applicant\u2019s career prospects enabling him to obtain a leadership position in academia or industry. More importantly, it will also contribute to the efficient usage of the spectrum, which is closely related to the economic future of the European Union (EU), especially the digital communication for essential public services such as defense, police and emergency services.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0.9,"mobile phones":0.5,"bluetooth":0.1,"WiFi":0.2,"data networks":0.8,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.8,"radio and television":0.7,"microwave technology":0.6,"mobile network":0.5,"4G":0.4,"optical networks":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0.9,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}

{"text":"Title: TUNEMODE - TUNABLE MODE RANDOM FIBER LASER FOR MODE DIVISION MULTIPLEXING LASER SOURCE Abstract: The evolution of the bandwidth demand in optical fiber communication system in the Europe region keeps increasing year after year. As for now, most of these demands are supported by the WDM system of optical communication network. It is forecasted that this increasing bandwidth demand could not be supported any more data traffics in the future due to the consumption growth of new applications. In this regards, a new system for solving this issue is becoming all the necessary. An alternative which is forecasted to be able to fulfill this demand is Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM). MDM basically is based on a concept developed for increasing the optical data transmission capacity within the optical fiber itself. Thus, this project will be carried out to investigate the mode tuning of random fiber laser for the application in MDM system. The main objective of this project is to generate a laser with various modes which can be tuned by using few mode fiber and will be using random fiber laser. The purpose of using random fiber laser is because the conventional rare earth based fiber laser such as Erbium and Ytterbium are not optimized for lasing at higher order mode than the fundamental mode LP01. Investigation on mode tunability will be carried out using micro fiber technology and also fiber Bragg grating technology whereby the combination of these two technologies will be functioning as the tunable and filtering element. Also, in this project, new ideas and concepts will be developed whereby the generation of a laser with various modes will probably generate new concepts and findings, not only for MDM system, but also for the device to support this application in the future. In this regards, this research is very significant, in conjunction with the growth of the bandwidth demand in the Europe region as well as in the world.","gt":["telecommunications"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"optical networks":0.9,"microwave technology":0.1,"radio technology":0.1,"mobile radio":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.2,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0.9,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0.1}}

To tackle this problem, we propose to generate compositions based on structural templates at varying hierarchical levels. Our novel approach deploys machine-learning methods in an optimization context to morph existing pieces into new ones and to fuse different styles.\n\nWe aim to develop a framework that combines machine learning techniques that learn style, with a powerful optimization method, the variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm, for generating music. This approach allows the learned model to incorporate a wide variety of constraints, including those for preserving long term coherence and structure. It promises to effect a step-change in automatic music generation by moving the field in the new direction of generating structured music using hybrid machine learning-optimization techniques.\n\nThe applicant is an operations researcher-musician, ideal for this work. A first step combines her VNS music generation algorithm with machine learning methods to ensure proper style evaluation. In previous work, the applicant has shown that VNS outperforms genetic algorithms when generating counterpoint with a rule-based objective function. In a preliminary study, the applicant has demonstrated the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques as evaluation metrics for optimisation methods. The applicant has extensive web development experience; to reach the widest possible audience, the resulting system will be made available in an interactive website where users can morph and fuse musical pieces.\nThis work is situated in the area of digital media, with a European consumer expenditure of over \u20ac33 billion in 2011, projected to increase.

Vehicle manoeuvre negotiation (at various levels of automation), infotainment, and emission control in sensitive areas are the cross-border use cases targeted by 5G-CARMEN pilots in order to maximise the project commercial, societal, end environmental impact.\nThe project will build a 5G-enabled corridor to conduct cross-border trials and will deploy a mixture of 5G micro- and macro-cells for ubiquitous C-V2X connectivity. The 5G New Radio will be used to support latency sensitive and\/or bandwidth hungry services and applications. The project will leverage on a distributed mobile edge cloud spanning from the vehicle itself to the centralised cloud. Multi-tenancy and neutral host concepts will be leveraged upon to deliver a final platform capable of enabling new business models. 5G-CARMEN will complement C-V2X with LTE and C-ITS technologies, targeting interoperability and harnessing a hybrid network.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.9,"mobile network":0.8,"radio and television":0.1,"4G":0.1,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"LiFi":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.9,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0.1}}
{"text":"Title: SmarterEMC2 - Smarter Grid: Empowering SG Market Actors through Information and Communication Technologies Abstract: Power systems undergo massive technological changes due to the ever increasing concerns for environmental and energy sustainability. The increase of RES and DG penetration is one of the main goals in Europe in order to meet the environmental targets. However these goals will require new business cases and must be based on innovative ICT tools and communication infrastructure. On parallel, following the M\/490 EU Mandate, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI proposed a technical report describing the Smart Grid Reference Architecture and the Smart Grids Architecture Model (SGAM) framework. A key objective of new Research and Innovation projects should be to provide solutions and ICT tools compatible with the SGAM and the standardization activity in Europe. Such new projects should also support the standardization activity by proposing additions or changes related to their objectives. Another key issue to address is whether the existing telecommunication infrastructure is sufficient to support in mass scale the new business cases and Smart Grid services. SmarterEMC2 implements ICT tools that support Customer Side Participation and RES integration, and facilitate open access in the electricity market. These tools take into account the SGAM as well the future structure of the Distribution Network as described by the relevant EU bodies and organizations. The project supports standardization activity by proposing adaptation to data models of market-oriented standards (IEC 62325-351) and field level standards (IEC 61850). Moreover, the project is fully dedicated towards achieving a maximum of impact. To validate the proposed technologies, the project includes 3 real-world pilots and large-scale simulation in 3 laboratories. The former will demonstrate the impact of Demand Response and Virtual Power Plants services in the real world settings, while the latter will reveal the ability of the communication networks to support massive uptake of such services.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

{"text":"Title: UMOBILE - Universal, mobile-centric and opportunistic communications architecture Abstract: Cars, sensors, home appliances, every device in the daily life of citizens is becoming a constituent in Future Internet, adding to the need to reconsider requirements and assumptions in terms of network availability and affordability to support the ever increasing traffic demand. Still, the current Internet can only evolve adequately, if its infrastructure can be devised to accommodate the emerging services. The increased cost of adding new infrastructure and capacity has a drastic effect on rural and remote communities as well as nomadic users as they become marginalized by not gaining access to crucial Internet services. Our goal is to make the Future Internet universally pervasive supporting a diverse set of services. To achieve this, we develop a universal mobile-centric and opportunistic communications architecture, which integrates the principles of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking (ICN) in a common framework. We utilize the benefits of both ICN and DTN to enable resource exploitation at minimal bandwidth, opportunistic access to information and more localized access to information through novel caching strategies. UMOBILE focuses on assisting users in getting access to the content they want or content that may be of shared interest to their trust circles. By relying on an instance of the UMOBILE architecture, users are able to share information directly with other peers without relying on infrastructure or expensive connectivity services. The proposed architecture targets the mobile part of the networks, extends Internet connectivity to regions that are not typically covered enhancing network resilience and is fully backward compatible with the current Internet architecture. We will validate our architecture in a real world trial as well as participate strategically in carefully planned dissemination, standardization and exploitation activities to ensure that our architecture transcends from the lab to real world deployments.","gt":["data networks","mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"mobile network":0.9,"radio technology":0.8,"mobile radio":0.8,"4G":0.7,"radio and television":0.5,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"5G":0.8,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0.6}}

My project addresses that problem by adopting a highly successful approach hat has been employed in (opto)electronics, which has led to the explosion of a new prolific scientific field, new technologies, and new products: the development of solution-based processing methods. Specifically, I propose to produce a step change in the photonics field through the employment of the Dynamic Templating Process (DTP), an elegant, fully solution-processing method, which exploits the self-assembly of water microdroplets, to create micro-honeycombs, i.e. 2D photonic crystals. As solution-processable material, I propose to use an organic:inorganic hybrid, which shows refractive indexes above 2. Then, I aim to create novel 2D hierarchical and 3D photonic structures based on thy hybrid honeycombs for optical field management. In the last stage I will transform the DTP into an industrially scalable process for photonic crystal and device manufacturing. Thereby, I propose an ambitious, multidisciplinary and self-consistent project, which encompasses the synthesis of novel materials, the development of microprocessing methods, the production and characterisation of a new class of photonic elements, and the development of industrial production processes.

{"text":"Title: HarvestAll - Development of multi-source micro energy harvesting power management devices Abstract: Many IoT market leaders incl. ARM Holdings (the world's leading semiconductor IP supplier) predict that the IoT will begin to free itself from battery power in 2018.  Without reducing the reliance on battery power, there is a significant roadblock in reaching trillions of devices. Future devices will need to be self-sufficient and operate without any battery swaps or any human intervention for decades. This will be made possible through harvesting of all the available ambient energy in the environment, for example:\nThermal energy associated with static and dynamic temperature differences;\nVibration energy e.g. from vehicles driving over a bridge or oil following through a pipe;\nLight energy from indoor artificial lighting. \nFor these predictions to be realised, the current roadblock is micro energy harvesting systems that can effectively capture all available energy using just one energy management device. The technical challenge is that these ambient energy sources have widely different electrical characteristics that must be managed e.g: photovoltaic and thermoelectric harvesters are low-voltage DC, resistive, \u201ctrickle\u201d sources; electrodynamic harvesters are high-voltage, inductive, \u201cpulsed\u201d sources whilst piezoelectric harvesters are high-voltage AC, capacitive, \u201cbursty\u201d sources.\nTrameto is a UK-based fabless semiconductor business that is focusing on bringing \u2018HarvestAll\u2019 to market.

{"text":"Title: NCLas - NanoCrystals in Fibre Lasers Abstract: The NCLas project will introduce and develop a disruptive technology for the synthesis of glasses containing functional nanocrystals (NCs). It is based on a novel hybrid nanosintering process, which allows for the incorporation of a large variety of NCs and functionalization of glasses in different formats for various applications. Previous attempts to either grow NCs inside glass by a glass heat treatment or incorporate NCs during glass formation showed unconvincing results. In our nanosintering process, key enabling steps include reducing the sintering temperature, developing specialized NC core-shell structures and adjusting the glass composition, thus achieving a chemically inert environment and matching the refractive index of NCs and glass. This technology will be exploited to produce low-loss, NC-functionalized glass fibres. Fibre lasers are energy efficient and compact and offer maintenance-free operation, ultra-short pulses, high power, and low noise. Today\u2019s commercial fibre lasers are fabricated from robust, durable silica glass. The operation of oxide fibre lasers can be extended to an enormous spectral range (~400\u20133000 nm) by doping oxide glasses with laser-active nanocrystals optimized for particular laser wavelengths, thus enabling a huge variety of new applications. We will demonstrate two highly relevant fibre lasers: (i) a Ti3+:sapphire-NC fibre laser tuneable around 800 nm for bio-photonic applications; (ii) a Pr3+:yttria-NC 1300-nm fibre laser enabling a much-awaited wavelength extension in telecommunications and also fitting into one of the biophotonic windows.

Abstract: This European Training Network aims to produce the next generation of early stage researchers who will enable Europe to take a leading role in the development of future devices, systems and networks supporting the 5G high-speed wireless internet. To do this, researchers must be able to work in interdisciplinary teams, integrate their activities, share expertise, and promote a vision of a converged wireless and optical devices and networks that efficiently supports the services and applications being demanded. A large number of technologies and devices will need to converge, co-exist and interoperate, and most importantly, cooperate, if this vision is to be efficiently and cost-effectively realised.

{"text":"Title: VRACE - VRACE - Virtual Reality Audio for Cyber Environments Abstract: \u201eVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have the potential to become the next big computing platform, and as we saw with the PC and Smartphone, we expect new markets to be created and existing markets to be disrupted.\u201c (Understanding the Race for the Next Computing Platform, Goldman Sachs 2016). While its technology is still considered in the early stages of development, it is already mature in the video game area.\nVR\/AR has the potential to change the way we do business, social interactions or education, but its applicability beyond gaming requires further development. An important field of research is the audio part. The importance of sound becomes evident when considering how people orientate themselves in space. Unlike seeing, hearing allows us to perceive instantly from all angles, and plays a leading role in giving us clues where to look at. To support natural orientation in VR\/AR, the visual and auditory information has to closely match, as otherwise the illusion is shattered and the experience is not convincing.\nVRACE aims at providing physically correct and perceptually convincing soundscapes in VR. This goal is pursued through dedicated training of ESRs in all VR-related domains, namely physical modelling, sound propagation, audio rendering and psychoacoustics. Specific research projects involve modelling of sound sources, such as musical instruments, voices, vehicles, colliding objects or environmental sound sources, studying sound propagation in complex interior spaces like concert halls and in outdoor environments such as urban or rural areas and investigating human perception and localisation of sounds.\nWith an estimated revenue of $80bn by 2025 (G&S) the demand for trained VR audio experts will increase rapidly. Besides advancing methodologies in this cutting-edge technology, VRACE will train 15 ESRs who will multiply and spread this knowledge in industry and academia. VRACE thus gives European industry a competitive edge in this global race.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: VESAFE - Enhanced 5G Vehicle to Vehicle Technologies for Safe and Reliable Connected Autonomous Vehicles Applications Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) holds great potentials for road safety and efficiency, but two major barriers need to be removed before its potentials can be fully unleashed: significantly enhanced vehicle to vehicle (eV2V) services with millimetre wave (mmWave) communications and reliable cooperative perception with autonomous vehicles (AV) sensors. However, the directional connectivity of mmWave presents new challenges for the whole protocol stack of V2V networks, while reliable cooperative perception requires novel design of deep learning (DL) models for object detection and fusion of sensor data from neighbour AVs. The above challenges underpinned by CAV demand a holistic design and tight integration of connected vehicles (CV) and AV technologies. \nThis innovative and multi-disciplinary project VESAFE will train the outstanding Fellow candidate to tackle the key challenges with complementary expertise and realize the full potentials of CAV. A novel cross-layer design is proposed for the research of 5th generation (5G) eV2V schemes with mmWave and reliable cooperative perception for advanced CAV safety applications: the eV2V schemes are AV oriented and greatly assisted by the AV cooperative perception, and the reliable cooperative perception is boosted by the awareness of V2V network conditions. And this project propose a novel integrated evaluation of 5G eV2V and CAV applications to support system design and performance characterization. Through the cutting-edge research, this innovative project will produce robust eV2V schemes and reliable cooperative perception solutions, make breakthrough on 5G V2V and CAV safety applications. It will significantly improve the Fellow\u2019s employability and career prospects, strengthen knowledge transfer, boosting the research and innovation (R&I) capacity and research quality, therefore contributing to Europe\u2019s competitiveness and growth in critical sectors of 5G\/6G and AV.","gt":["5G"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.9,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.7,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.9,"radio technology":0.9,"mobile radio":0.8,"mobile network":0.7,"radio and television":0.1,"microwave technology":0.8,"4G":0.1,"optical networks":0.0,"LiFi":0.0,"5G":1.0,"telecommunications networks":0.9,"cognitive radio":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"satellite radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: ORACLE - ORigin determination and improved detectAbility of Celestial-to-Local phEnomena by the VLF technique Abstract: The lower ionosphere (70\u201390 km), a ionized region in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, can be understood as a membrane acting as a sensor to different kinds of phenomena originating at Earth (e.g., lightning) or in space (e.g., space weather). Unexpected strong changes in this region can influence dramatically the performance and reliability of navigation and communication. However, the impact of those phenomena in this region is difficult to quantify accurately. On one hand, this region is too high for balloons and on the other hand it is too low for satellites. In this project, Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio waves will be used because they propagate between the Earth surface and the ionosphere with low attenuation. The researcher will push forward novel scientific understanding of the properties of the lower ionosphere and magnetosphere. She will: (1) determine whether the day-to-day variability of the VLF signal during sunrise can be explained by the ozone variability at its upper boundary, (2) find the yet unknown generation mechanism of VLF banded emissions, and (3) improve the detectability of galactic gamma-ray bursts, known as the most energetic phenomena in the universe. The project is strongly multidisciplinary, involving perspectives and concepts from astrophysics, magnetospheric, ionospheric, atmospheric physics and big data handling. This will be developed by the researcher within the frame of interaction and cooperation with the host and secondments. The results of this proposal have the potential to convey new perspectives in ionospheric and magnetospheric studies and provide some answers to long standing issues within the field of space weather, which has become of central importance in many aspects of human life and industry.

The total economic cost of premature deaths in the WHO European Region has been estimated at \u20ac1.47 trillion each year. Emissions from petrol and particularly diesel vehicles (esp. \u2018PM2.5\u2019) are a major contributor to this crisis.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are well suited for modern Smart City environments; they produce zero emissions at point of use and less noise pollution compared with gasoline-powered vehicles. However, the growth of charging infrastructure has not kept momentum with vehicle development, limiting the widespread uptake of EVs. The currently available unreliable, slowcharging infrastructure is ineffective, making longer journeys uncertain, causing \u2018range anxiety\u2019. Slow chargers take 9 hours or more to charge a car, but upgrading slow chargers to rapid charging posts (involving inflexible sub-station upgrades and associated disruption over a long period) is impractical and costly for local authorities.

{"text":"Title: CAMELOT - C2 Advanced Multi-domain Environment and Live Observation Technologies Abstract: The creation of the Schengen area has been one of the major achievements of the EU. However, this agreement requires countries to cooperate tightly in order to keep a high level of security at their internal borders, as well as to share the responsibility of managing external borders. Such a variety of borders (land, sea and air) and current challenges requires a consistent approach to border surveillance, based on a plethora of heterogeneous assets. These can be manned or unmanned, ranging from sensors (optical, radar, IR) to unmanned platforms (UAV, UGV, USV or UUV), and need to be combined to offer an integrated situational picture of the area under surveillance and of their location. In order to effectively control their operation and manage the large amounts of data collected by them, new approaches for command and control need to be considered, allowing efficient interaction between the operator and the different assets in the field. CAMELOT proposes to develop and demonstrate different advanced command and control service modules for multiple platform domains, based on a SOA architecture that specifies internal and external interfaces, allowing the development of a modular and scalable command and control station, customisable to the user needs. This architecture can be based on results of previous studies and work or open architectures that may prove more suitable and the interfaces can take advantage of the standardisation work that has been done already. After the definition, CAMELOT partners will prototype service modules according to their expertise, background individual technologies and practitioner needs. These will be integrated progressively in specific testing along the project. This prototype development approach will culminate in 2 final demonstrations involving end users and relevant stakeholders, to achieve a maturity of TRL6 (for most individual technologies supporting the functionalities for border surveillance) and an IRL of 7 for CAMELOT.","gt":["radar"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.9,"radar":0.9,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0.8,"radio technology":0.7,"mobile radio":0.6,"mobile network":0.5,"radio and television":0.4,"microwave technology":0.3,"4G":0.2,"LiFi":0.1,"satellite radio":0.0,"telecommunications networks":0.2,"5G":0.0,"fiber-optic network":0.0,"cognitive radio":0.0,"fixed wireless network":0.0}}

{"text":"Title: PROTECTIVE - Proactive Risk Management  through Improved Cyber Situational Awareness Abstract: PROTECTIVE is designed to improve an organisations ongoing awareness of the risk posed to its business by cyber security attacks. PROTECTIVE makes two key contributions to achieve this enhanced situational awareness. Firstly it increases the computer security incident response team\u2019s (CSIRT) threat awareness through improved security monitoring and increased sharing of threat intelligence between organisations within a community. Secondly it ranks critical alerts based on the potential damage the attack can inflict on the threatened assets and hence to the organisations business. High impact alerts that target important hosts will have a higher priority than other alerts. Through the combination of these two measures organisations are better prepared to handle incoming attacks, malware outbreaks and other security problems and to guide the development of the prevention and remediation processes.\nThe PROTECTIVE system is designed to provide solutions for public domain CSIRTs and SME\u2019s who both have needs outside the mainstream of cyber security solution provision. Public CSIRTs needs arise in part because commercial tools do not address their unique requirements. This has created a shortfall, clearly articulated by ENISA, of tools with the required analytical and visualisation capabilities to enable public CSIRTs provide optimised services to their constituency. SME\u2019s also are vulnerable to cybercrime as they have limited resources to protect themselves and often a limited understanding of what needs to be done.

{"text":"Title: SINHOPSI - Single-Hole Pumping in Silicon Abstract: A globally consistent system of measurement units and reference standards is a necessary underpinning feature of most technological, industrial and economic activities. In fact, to perform measurements of physical quantities, record and compare them in a consistent way, systems of units and standards have been historically developed and agreed upon. However, in the last few decades, the ever-increasing need for stability and reliability has determined a shift from standards based on material artefacts or prototypes towards those based on physical phenomena and true constants of nature. The focus of this proposal is the development of a novel quantum technology to generate highly accurate electric currents directly linked to the elementary charge. This could serve as the practical implementation for a quantum-based standard for the SI unit ampere, which is a long-standing goal in electrical metrology. Semiconductor nano-scale charge pumps have been used in the last three decades to generate accurate electric currents by clocking the transport of single electrons with driving oscillators. The main limitation to the fidelity of the charge transfer is ultimately ascribable to the poor spatial confinement of electrons that produces errors during the pumping cycle. In this project silicon-based nanotechnology will be employed to realize and operate the world-first charge pump based on the transfer of single holes rather than electrons. A hole carries the positive equivalent of an elementary charge, but its effective mass can be significantly larger than the electron's. The resulting tightly confined charge carrier wavefunction is expected to provide significant benefits in suppressing pumping errors. The primary objectives will be to develop the underpinning technology to fabricate and operate the first single-hole pump, and experimentally assess its performances in comparison to the well-established electron-based technology.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: NARRATIVENSCIENCE - Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives Abstract: The aim of this project is to understand the role of narrative in modern science. Narratives have appeared in many places in the human, social and natural sciences over the past two centuries. They can be found both in accounts of real situations and in simulations of virtual situations, in empirical work and in theorizing. It is clear that narratives have played important roles for scientists well beyond the simple act of reporting. Yet we lack an account of what kinds of thing scientists know from using narrative and how such \u2018narrative knowing\u2019 is constituted. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of medicine and evolutionary biology, even the study of those field narratives, as narratives, has been largely ignored by both historians of science and narrative scholars.\nWhat do scientists gain from using narratives, what functions do narratives play? Initial research shows that scientists have used narratives to figure out what fits together with what, and to create coherence amongst the elements in their research.  But the means of such ordering vary - from site to site, and from science to science. Narratives used to explore a path dependent system in nineteenth century biology used a different mode of ordering both from the configuring narratives of mid-twentieth century case studies in sociology, and from the \u2018how possibly\u2019 narratives of modern computer-based simulations. Such variety requires a broad project, using many case studies to explore the critical role that scientists\u2019 narratives have played in modern science. Making sense of such variety offers an ambitious challenge. But while there is surely no simple answer to why scientists use narratives, all these notions of narrative ordering do have something in common. They suggest that narratives function not just to describe and report as one might expect, they play a much more important role in answering scientists\u2019s own questions and so - in various ways - in providing scientific explanations.","gt":["teleology"],"preds":{"teleology":0.9,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: GLYCOSENSE - Polymer brush sensing arrays for the identification of pathogens Abstract: Surfaces with the capacity for selective recognition of particular pathogens would offer great potential in a number of biomedical applications, including diagnostic devices. Mammalian cells are decorated with a carbohydrate-rich layer, the glycocalyx, which facilitates cellular recognition. Carbohydrate-binding proteins can interact with these sugar motifs to facilitate highly selective recognition, a strategy which is exploited by many viral and bacterial pathogens. Such species have evolved to display recognition units on their surfaces which may interact with considerable affinity with glycan structures displayed on cellular surfaces. This molecular recognition constitutes a key step in the processes of infection or toxicity, and is therefore an attractive target for the development of diagnostic devices. In this project, Dr Clare Mahon proposes to develop surface-tethered polymer brushes which will mimic the glycocalyx in terms of facilitating adhesion of pathogens. Through the incorporation of different fluorophores, the surfaces will be used to construct sensing arrays which will enable the rapid and cost-effective identification of water-borne pathogens and common respiratory pathogens.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: ELVER - Engineering with Logic and Verification: Mathematically Rigorous Engineering for Safe and Secure Computer Systems Abstract: Computer systems have become critical to modern society, but they are pervasively subject to security flaws and malicious attacks, with large-scale exposures of confidential data, denial-of-service and ransom attacks, and the threat of nation-state attackers: they are trusted, but are far from trustworthy. This is especially important for the major pan-industry components of our information infrastructure: processors, programming languages, operating systems, etc.\n\nThe basic problem is that conventional engineering techniques suffice only to make systems that *usually* work. The usual test-and-debug development methods, with poorly specified abstractions described in prose, lack the mathematical rigour of other engineering disciplines - yet the huge investment in legacy systems and skills makes it hard to improve.\n\nELVER will develop *mathematically rigorous* methods for specifying, testing, and reasoning about *real systems*, focussed on the core mechanisms used by hardware and software to enforce security boundaries.  It will establish mathematical models for the industry ARM architecture, used pervasively in mobile phones and embedded devices, and the CHERI research architecture, which protects against many attacks. Using these, ELVER will build tools for analysis of system software, develop techniques for mathematical proof of safety and security properties, and explore improved systems programming languages.  ELVER will build on successful collaborations with ARM, IBM, and the C\/C++ ISO standards committees.  It will directly impact mainstream processor architectures, languages, and development methods, smoothly complementing existing methods while simultaneously enabling longer-term research towards the gold standard of provably secure systems.\n\nELVER will thus demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a more rigorous approach to system engineering, putting future systems on more solid foundations, and hence making them safer and more secure","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.2,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.8,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.6,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

Through an experienced interdisciplinary consortium, MAZI delivers a DIY networking toolkit that offers tools and guidelines for the easy deployment and customization of local networks and services. MAZI toolkit is designed to take advantage of particular characteristics of DIY networking: the de facto physical proximity between those connected; the increased privacy and autonomy; and the inclusive access. Such characteristics are used to promote information exchanges that can develop the location-based collective awareness, as a basis for fostering social cohesion, conviviality, knowledge sharing, and sustainable living. To achieve this objective, MAZI brings together partners from different disciplines: computer networks, urban planning and interdisciplinary studies, human-computer interaction, community informatics, and design research. These academic partners will collaborate closely with four community partners to ensure that MAZI toolkit benefits from the grounded experience of citizen engagement. MAZI draws from the diverse mix of competencies of its consortium to develop a transdisciplinary research framework, which will guide a series of long-term pilot studies in a range of environments, and enhanced by cross-fertilization events. The main goal of this process, and measure of success, is establishing DIY networking as a mainstream technology for enabling the development of collective awareness between those in physical proximity, and the development of surrounding research and theorizing of this approach.","gt":["telecommunications networks"],"preds":{"teleology":0.1,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0.5,"radar":0.1,"mobile phones":0.3,"bluetooth":0.2,"WiFi":0.4,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0.2,"mobile radio":0.4,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0.6,"radio and television":0.2,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0.8,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0.8}}
{"text":"Title: MolCellTissMech - Molecular and cellular determinants of cell monolayer mechanics Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are amongst the simplest tissues in the body, yet they play fundamental roles in adult organisms where they separate the internal environment from the external environment and in development when the intrinsic forces generated by cells within the monolayer drive tissue morphogenesis. The mechanics of these simple tissues is dictated by the cytoskeletal and adhesive proteins that interface the constituent cells into a tissue-scale mechanical syncitium. Mutations in these proteins lead to diseases with fragilised epithelia. However, a quantitative understanding of how subcellular structures govern monolayer mechanics, how cells sense their mechanical environment and what mechanical forces participate in tissue morphogenesis is lacking.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, my lab devised a new technique to study the mechanics of load-bearing monolayers under well-controlled mechanical conditions while allowing imaging at subcellular, cellular and tissue resolutions. Using this instrument, my proposal aims to understand the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics as well as the cellular behaviours that drive tissue morphogenesis.  I will focus on four objectives: 1) discover the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics, 2) characterise monolayer mechanics, 3) dissect how tension is sensed by monolayers, and 4) investigate the biophysics of individual cell behaviours participating in tissue morphogenesis.\n\nTogether these studies will enable us to understand how monolayer mechanics is affected by changes in single cell behaviour, subcellular organisation, and molecular turnover. This multi-scale characterisation of monolayer mechanics will set the stage for new theoretical descriptions of living tissues involving both molecular-scale phenomena (cytoskeletal turnover, contractility, and protein unfolding) operating on short time-scales and rearrangements due to cell-scale phenomena (cell intercalation, cell division) acting on longer times.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
{"text":"Title: Airport IQ - Situation-Aware Mobile Platform for Airport Collaborative Decision-Making Abstract: The economic costs of aircraft delays in Europe have been estimated at 1.25Bn Euros per year. Aircraft delays also result in environmental costs: aircraft holding or queuing with engines on, resulting in excess environmental emissions and air quality or noise impact, unnecessary ground movements and activation of auxiliary power units.\nAirport IQ will develop a mobile information sharing system connecting back-end A-CDM systems with mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and other wearable devices) carried by ground staff. The system will provide the right information at the right place and time to the right people, making it easier for planners to make optimal use of resources. This will help reduce primary and reactionary delays, improve the reliability of estimates, and allow airlines to make smarter decisions about turnaround buffers, that will be shorter than before.  Airport IQ will also offer a simple way to simulate turnaround activities, making it possible to run operational exercises using the same mobile tools, which will simplify and improve the quality of training, as well as providing the basis for designing longer-term improvements in ground handling processes. \nThe solution has the potential to create significant economic and environmental savings for the entire air transport value chain, as demonstrated by pilot trials  to be organized in 3 European airports (Lisboa, Heathrow and Targu Mures), involving real end-users (i.e. ground handling and other airport staff) using \u201clive\u201d onsite data.

{"text":"Title: COSMOS - Control and measurement of single macromolecules in space and time Abstract: The desire to \u201cfreely suspend the constituents of matter\u201d in order to study their behaviour can be traced back over 200 years to Lichtenberg\u2019s diaries. From radio-frequency ion traps to optical tweezing of colloidal particles, existing methods to trap matter in free space or solution rely on the use of external fields that often strongly perturb the integrity of a macromolecule in solution. Recently, I invented the \u2018electrostatic fluidic trap\u2019, a \u201cfield-free\u201d principle that supports stable, non-destructive confinement of single macromolecules in room temperature fluids, representing a paradigm shift in a nearly century-old field. The spatio-temporal dynamics of a single electrostatically trapped molecule reveals fundamental information on its properties, e.g., size and electrical charge. The charge of a macromolecule is in turn a strong function of its 3D conformation - the molecular basis of biological function. I now aim to develop a new platform to study 3D macromolecular structure and temporal conformation by measuring the electrical charge of a single trapped molecule in real time, using both optical microscopy and electrical detection. Beyond the conformational dynamics of a single molecule, we will also examine interactions between two or more molecules, and the detection of minute structural differences between closely related molecular isoforms. We will further develop a novel approach to electrical transport measurements on single molecules aimed at generating for the first time a catalog of \u2018electrical signatures\u2019 for biomolecules in solution. The ability to experimentally link electrical charge and molecular structure will not only open up a new physical dimension in our understanding of macromolecules, but also advance the development of ultrasensitive, high-throughput molecular sensors for biomedical detection and analytics, potentially enabling an optical or electrical \u201csingle-snapshot\u201d read-out of the proteome or transcriptome of a single cell.","gt":["radio frequency"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0.8,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0.8,"radio technology":0.2,"mobile radio":0.1,"4G":0.1,"LiFi":0.1,"mobile network":0.1,"radio and television":0.1,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}

It is a major contributor to EU GDP and its size continues to grow fueled by demand from consumers to many industries. Despite its many positive impacts, the industry also faces some challenges connected with the enormous quantity of raw materials that it needs for sustainability, the huge quantity of Waste Electrical, Electronics Equipment (WEEE) generated and the threat of competition from Asia. To sustain its growth, to manage the impact of WEEE and to face the competition from Asia, the industry needs innovations in key areas. One such area is the drive for ultra-miniaturisation\/ultlra-functionality of equipment. The key current road block\/limitation to achieving the goal of ultra-miniaturisation\/functionality is how to increase the component density on the printed circuit board (PCB). This is currently limited by the availability of hyper fine pitch solder powder pastes. FineSol aims to deliver at first stage an integrated production line for solder particles with size 1-10 \u03bcm and to formulate solder pastes containing these particles. Thus, by proper printing methods (e.g. screen and jet printing) the fabrication of  PCBs with more than double component density will be achieved. Consequently, this would effectively enable more than a doubling of the functions available on electronic devices such as cell phones, satellite navigation systems, health devices etc. The successful completion of the FineSol project would lift the ultra-miniaturisation\/functionality road block and also enable reduction in raw material usage, reduction in WEEE, reduction in pollution and associated health costs and also a major reduction in EU energy demand with all its indirect benefits for environment and society.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0.8,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0.9,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0.8,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0.1,"telecommunications networks":0.2,"5G":0.1,"fiber-optic network":0.1,"cognitive radio":0.1,"fixed wireless network":0.1}}

{"text":"Title: VISMEM - Visualising memories of violence in urban places: gender and wellbeing in Istanbul Abstract: Evidence shows that violence in urban areas affects women of all ages, socio economic and cultural backgrounds in particular (WHO 2014). The immediate and extensive costs of violence targeting women perpetuate the existing gender hierarchies by setting boundaries on women\u2019s movement, mobility, presence: that is, on their use of urban space. In addition to restrictions in mainstream social life, gendered violence is a systemic source of experiencing helplessness, humiliation, and distress which overall are a fundamental component of women\u2019s wellbeing. VISMEM will investigate the impact of place-based memories of violence among diverse women for their use of urban space, and interrogate the utility of visual methods for understanding that impact. More precisely, the study uses visual methods to explore diverse women\u2019s everyday negotiations of space in Istanbul, focusing in particular on their movements in relation to three research sites where forms of violence against women have occurred. VISMEM\u2019s overall objective is to develop a conceptual framework and visual tools for multisector policy and research engagement with memory as a key means to locate, assess, and ameliorate women's differential experience of violence and wellbeing in the city. Women in different social and spatial settings remember (and forget) the physical and mental effects of violence through personal experience and through popular accounts of its effects. The differential workings of memory in turn have implications on the lived experiences and wellbeing of a city's current (and future) residents\/visitors. Yet, the nexus of memory, place, gender remains disconnected from the multisector urban agenda on difference, inclusion, and wellbeing. VISMEM will provide transferable knowledge and policy-related results on the relation between gendered violence, memory, and will greatly improve our understanding of place memory as a focus in achieving gender-goals in urban social and spatial integration.","gt":["mobile phones"],"preds":{"teleology":0,"telecommunications":0,"radio frequency":0,"radar":0,"mobile phones":0,"bluetooth":0,"WiFi":0,"data networks":0,"optical networks":0,"microwave technology":0,"radio technology":0,"mobile radio":0,"4G":0,"LiFi":0,"mobile network":0,"radio and television":0,"satellite radio":0,"telecommunications networks":0,"5G":0,"fiber-optic network":0,"cognitive radio":0,"fixed wireless network":0}}
