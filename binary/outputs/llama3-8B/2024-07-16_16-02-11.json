{"text":"Title: interACT - Designing cooperative interaction of automated vehicles with other road users in mixed traffic environments Abstract: There is currently a high desire by manufacturers to introduce Automated Vehicles (AVs), SAE level 3 and above, to the market. As AVs are likely to be deployed in mixed traffic, they need to interact safely and efficiently with other (non-equipped) users, including manually driven vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. Although obstacle detection by AVs is almost flawless, these vehicles cannot communicate their intentions to other road users. This limitation currently reduces their appeal and value to the user. To ensure intuitive and cooperative interaction between the AV and others, and a smooth flow of all traffic, it is essential that there is good means of communication between all actors. The main objective of interACT is to substantially improve this communication and cooperation strategy. interACT will provide an overview of current human-machine interactions in mixed traffic, and increase chances of safe deployment of AVs by developing novel software and HMI hardware components for reliable and user-centric communication between an AV with its users. interACT will: \n1) Use social-psychological models to compile a catalogue of interactions, identifying the main communication needs of road users in current and future traffic scenarios \n2) Improve software algorithms and sensor capabilities for assessing intention recognition and behaviour prediction of surrounding road users \n3) Use a Cooperation and Communication Planning Unit to integrate planning algorithms, providing synchronized and integrated communication protocols \n4) Ensure safety of road users by developing easy-to-verify software for a safety layer, and novel methods for fail-safe trajectory planning. \nPrototypes will be developed and evaluated in multi-actor simulators and two test vehicles, assessing ease-of-use, acceptance, safety and reliability. The impact of this successful communication on reduction of crashes, improvement of traffic flow and acceptance of AVs by society will be investigated.","gt":true,"conf":0.6}
{"text":"Title: 5GCITY - 5GCITY Abstract: Delivering on the 5G promise of increased data rates, and ubiquitous coverages, poses stringent requirements on traditional vertically integrated operators. In particular, telecom operators are expected to massively  roll out Small Cells, which requires finding appropriate urban spaces with both backhaul and energy availability. Network sharing becomes essential to unlock those commercial massive deployments. The open access model, or neutral host, will come to play a key role on the deployment of 5G networks, especially in urban scenarios where very dense Small Cell deploymens are required. \nIn parallel recent trends are paving the way towards the development of new, heterogeneous and distributed cloud paradigms that significantly differ from today\u2019s established cloud model: with edge computing, cloud architectures are pushed all the way to the edge of the network, close to the devices that produce and act on data. We posit that there are two sets of players perfectly poised to take advantage of both trends since they already own the infrastructure needed to build edge deployments: telecommunication providers and municipalities. 5GCity focuses on how common smart city infrastructure (i.e.,small cells and processing power at the very edge of networks) can bring benefit to both players based on resource sharing and end-to-end virtualization, pushing the cloud model to the extreme edge. \n5GCity will design, develop, deploy and demonstrate a distributed cloud and radio platform for municipalities and infrastructure owners acting as 5G neutral hosts. 5GCity\u2019s main aim is to build and deploy a common, multi-tenant, open platform that extends the (centralized) cloud model to the extreme edge of the network, with a demonstration in three different cities (Barcelona, Bristol and Lucca). 5GCity will directly impact a large and varied range of actors: (i) telecom providers; (ii) municipalities; and (iii) a number of different vertical sectors utilizing the city infrastructure","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

In our main project NETSIGNAL, we have developed computational environment ARACHNE aiming to facilitate high-end neural network exploration among scientific and industrial users. ARACHNE enables an investigator to construct and explore cellular networks of arbitrary biophysical and architectural complexity using a simple interface on a local computer or a mobile device. Through small-file exchange via the internet, the interface controls a pre-configured computational kernel installed on a remote computer cluster or cloud. Uniquely, ARACHNE can integrate traditional wired network connections with diffuse, volume-transmitted type of inter-cellular signalling, to reflect the emerging role of glia in brain processing. ARACHNE thus affords a flexible neural network design and incorporates latest advances in neuroscience while providing a portable console suitable for IT-untrained explorers.

Owing to growing underwater activities, e.g., undersea oil & gas exploration, and Internet of underwater things, reliable water-to-air wireless communications are urgently needed by the industry, military, and scientific communities. As it is difficult to use a single type of signal, e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), or optical, for communication across a water-air interface, most existing water-to-air communications rely on sonobuoys to relay acoustic signals from underwater transmitters to RF receivers on\/above the water surface. The global sonobuoy market is predicted to reach $595.9 million at a 6.62% CAGR over the period 2018-2023. Since sonobuoys might not be recovered from remote, hostile areas of the ocean, battery-powered sonobuoys (which have battery packs full of toxic metals) are posing a great threat to the marine environment.

Cognitive psychology identifies five main personalities (Big-5): extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness. How these Big-5 differ in the dynamics of stress are unexplored, particularly in the field of construction where stress is also prevalent. Behavioural science explains differences in the coping abilities of people. Thus Part A of the study is an empirical investigation of the impacts of stressors on the Big-5 and their different coping behaviours. Data from at least 1500 UK construction personnel will be collected using a questionnaire, and analysed using multiple inferential statistical techniques: hierarchical regression, factor analysis and sequential equation modelling. The findings will then inform Part B: the development of Streblo, a cloud-based IT tool for the effective recognition and deterrence of stress. Streblo will operate on artificial intelligence and its initial simulation will be carried out using of the WEKA software. Data from 1200 respondents will be used to train Streblo while the remaining 300 pseudo responses will be used to pilot (validate) the performance of the product.

However, vertical industries today can only verify use cases in small scales in commercial environments, before investing in large scale deployments. Through ICT-17 projects 5G infrastructures become available to verticals to test their applications, however large-scale trials are still not possible. 5G-VICTORI will conduct large scale trials for advanced vertical use case verification focusing on Transportation, Energy, Media and Factories of the Future and cross-vertical use cases. It leverages 5G network technologies developed in 5G-PPP Phase-1 and Phase-2 projects 5G-XHaul and 5G-PICTURE and exploits extensively existing facilities interconnecting main sites of all ICT-17 infrastructures i.e. 5G-VINNI, 5GENESIS and 5G-EVE and the 5G UK test-bed in a Pan-European Infrastructure.

Existing sources of THz radiation are still too large and expensive to be a massively deployed in all of the existing and proposed applications, which include large bandwidth wireless communications and the extension of security screening to far-infrared spectroscopic identification of chemicals and explosives up to 10 THz.

{"text":"Title: PJ18 4DTM - 4D Trajectory Management Abstract: One of the main obstacles of reaching Single European Sky\u2019s objectives is management of flight trajectories. Inaccuracies are difficult to spot and information given to stakeholders about the trajectory is limited, arriving late, and full of inconsistencies and wrong assumptions. Military Flights are currently not integrated in the ATM-system, so demanding special treatment.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lack of complete, updated, unique and coherent aeronautical and meteorological information at European level, which again limits the accuracy of the predicted trajectory and so difficult detecting incoming issues and designing optimum solutions.\n\nThis project addresses solutions for the above limitations. Harmonized and global trajectory information sharing, including improved negotiation mechanisms, will enable significant operational benefits on flight management. The aim is to enable a unique and integrated view of all flights trajectories (including military ones) among the stakeholders. This is improved thanks to new tools and capabilities ensuring all stakeholders are managing a single, updated and complete view of the forecasted meteorology and airspace configuration.\n\nBoth solutions above will increase safety and efficiency - a very important step towards ensuring that anyone can fly safer, cheaper and quicker in Europe in 10 years.\n\nAs so many stakeholders are involved, this issue cannot be solved at national level. All stakeholders (mainly air navigation service providers, as well as air and ground industry partners) need to be involved as all will need to perform changes to ensure successful implementation.

{"text":"Title: COHERENT - Coordinated control and spectrum management for 5G heterogeneous radio access networks Abstract: The exponential growth of mobile traffic, drastically increasing of network complexity, and the strong need for inter-network coordination of wireless network resources call for breakthroughs in control, coordination and flexible spectrum management  in 5G heterogeneous radio access networks. The COHERENT project aims to address these problems by researching, developing and validating a novel control framework for future mobile networks. The key innovation of COHERENT is to develop a unified programmable control framework to coordinate the underlying heterogeneous mobile networks as a whole. The COHERENT control framework has two unique features to deal with the insufficiency of current control solutions for inter-network coordination. First, theories and methods to abstract the low layer network states and behaviors of different underlying mobile networks are developed, which provides a simplified but sufficient abstracted network view for network-wide control and resource coordination. Network abstraction will significantly reduce the signaling overhead, making scalable network-wide control solutions feasible, and enable more flexible spectrum management, which are key for the success of 5G networks. Second, based on the abstracted network view, common interfaces and software-development kits will be developed to enable programmability in controlling and coordinating heterogeneous mobile networks. The programmable control will provide operators a flexible and cost efficient way to implement new control functions and thus to support new services. The innovative impact of the COHERENT project is in enabling a unified control and coordination framework for heterogeneous mobile networks by combining innovative approaches on abstraction of low layers in underlying mobile networks, software defined networking, and flexible spectrum management.

If even one of the parts fails the controls won\u2019t work and car models could be recalled by the factory to have to fix the issue. The assembled components are difficult to take apart and need to go through a timely, costly process to be recycled and not be turned into e-waste. The main problem behind in-car controls are that they cause significant distractions to drivers which has been found the cause of 80% of road traffic accidents. The problem is only becoming worse with infotainment displays imbedded with multiple lights and sensors and controls being inputted through a large touch-screen device.\nTangi0 have developed a new method for operating controls in the cockpit of cars through an intuitive, tactile material with distinctive shapes that allow drivers to operate it eye-free. This reduces the safety hazards of driving distractions. Using a touch-sensitive, conductive material also means that there is a huge reduction in electronic components needed in the product making a much cheaper, environmentally friendly.\nFollowing a very promising preliminary validation of the innovative technology with Jaguar-Land Rover, Tangi0 now intend to develop and design the integrated system and fully commercialize the solution by reaching the market in 2021.

{"text":"Title: LPGPU2 - Low-Power Parallel Computing on GPUs 2 Abstract: Low-power GPUs have become ubiquitous, they can be found in domains ranging from wearable and mobile computing, to automotive systems. With this ubiquity has come a wider range of applications exploiting low-power GPUs, placing ever increasing demands on the expected performance and power efficiency of the devices.  Future low-power system-on-chips will have to provide higher performance and be able to support more complex applications, without using any additional power.\n\nThe strict power limitations means that these demands cannot be met through hardware improvements alone, however, but the software must better exploit the available resources.  Unfortunately, programmers are hindered when creating low-power GPU software by the quality of current performance analysis tools.  In low-power GPU contexts there is only a minimal amount of performance information, and essentially no power information, available to the programmer.  As software becomes more complex it becomes increasingly unmanageable for programmers to optimise the software for low-power devices.\n\nThis project proposes to aid the programmer in creating software for low-power GPUs by building on the results of the first LPGPU project to provide a complete performance analysis process for the programmer.  This project will address all aspects of performance analysis, from hardware power and performance counters, to a toolchain that processes and visualises information from these counters, to applications that will be used as use-cases to drive the entire design.  To access the new hardware performance counters a standardisable API will be produced to interface to a prototype hardware implementation.  This will let the analysis and visualisation tool connect to any GPU driver that implements the API.  The consortium's expertise will be used not only to drive the initial design of the API and analyses, but also multiple application use-cases will be developed to demonstrate the efficacy of the toolchain.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}
{"text":"Title: ComRad - Combining MIMO Radar with MU-MIMO Communications: More than Coexistence (ComRad) Abstract: Frequency spectrum has nowadays become one of the most valuable assets, as the wireless communications devices and services are growing explosively. Realising the scarcity of the spectrum, future wireless systems are exploring the feasibility to use the spectrum that is currently occupied by radar systems, such as 3.4GHz and 5.6GHz bands used by airborne and shipborne radars. With the allocation of available spectrum to newer communication technologies, the interference in radar bands is on the rise consequently. Therefore, effective interference management approaches are needed for achieving the spectral coexistence between the current radar and communication services. More fundamentally, dual-functional systems that can simultaneously perform remote sensing and transmit useful information via classical communications could be an essential solution in the future, which not only ensures the spectral coexistence but also the improvement for both radar and communication\u2019s performance. The goal of ComRad is to develop novel signal processing techniques for transmit and receive beamforming, waveform design, signal classification\/recognition, and channel estimation, to enable the exploitation of radar spectrum for communication applications, with particular focus on 1) coexisting communication and radar systems (C-ComRad), and 2) Dual-functional Communication-Radar Systems (D-ComRad). The main research approaches that will be employed include the cutting-age concepts of interference exploitation, manifold based optimization and machine learning.

As for now, most of these demands are supported by the WDM system of optical communication network. It is forecasted that this increasing bandwidth demand could not be supported any more data traffics in the future due to the consumption growth of new applications. In this regards, a new system for solving this issue is becoming all the necessary. An alternative which is forecasted to be able to fulfill this demand is Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM). MDM basically is based on a concept developed for increasing the optical data transmission capacity within the optical fiber itself. Thus, this project will be carried out to investigate the mode tuning of random fiber laser for the application in MDM system. The main objective of this project is to generate a laser with various modes which can be tuned by using few mode fiber and will be using random fiber laser. The purpose of using random fiber laser is because the conventional rare earth based fiber laser such as Erbium and Ytterbium are not optimized for lasing at higher order mode than the fundamental mode LP01. Investigation on mode tunability will be carried out using micro fiber technology and also fiber Bragg grating technology whereby the combination of these two technologies will be functioning as the tunable and filtering element.

The increase of RES and DG penetration is one of the main goals in Europe in order to meet the environmental targets. However these goals will require new business cases and must be based on innovative ICT tools and communication infrastructure. On parallel, following the M\/490 EU Mandate, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI proposed a technical report describing the Smart Grid Reference Architecture and the Smart Grids Architecture Model (SGAM) framework. A key objective of new Research and Innovation projects should be to provide solutions and ICT tools compatible with the SGAM and the standardization activity in Europe. Such new projects should also support the standardization activity by proposing additions or changes related to their objectives. Another key issue to address is whether the existing telecommunication infrastructure is sufficient to support in mass scale the new business cases and Smart Grid services. SmarterEMC2 implements ICT tools that support Customer Side Participation and RES integration, and facilitate open access in the electricity market. These tools take into account the SGAM as well the future structure of the Distribution Network as described by the relevant EU bodies and organizations. The project supports standardization activity by proposing adaptation to data models of market-oriented standards (IEC 62325-351) and field level standards (IEC 61850). Moreover, the project is fully dedicated towards achieving a maximum of impact. To validate the proposed technologies, the project includes 3 real-world pilots and large-scale simulation in 3 laboratories.

Still, the current Internet can only evolve adequately, if its infrastructure can be devised to accommodate the emerging services. The increased cost of adding new infrastructure and capacity has a drastic effect on rural and remote communities as well as nomadic users as they become marginalized by not gaining access to crucial Internet services. Our goal is to make the Future Internet universally pervasive supporting a diverse set of services. To achieve this, we develop a universal mobile-centric and opportunistic communications architecture, which integrates the principles of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking (ICN) in a common framework. We utilize the benefits of both ICN and DTN to enable resource exploitation at minimal bandwidth, opportunistic access to information and more localized access to information through novel caching strategies. UMOBILE focuses on assisting users in getting access to the content they want or content that may be of shared interest to their trust circles. By relying on an instance of the UMOBILE architecture, users are able to share information directly with other peers without relying on infrastructure or expensive connectivity services. The proposed architecture targets the mobile part of the networks, extends Internet connectivity to regions that are not typically covered enhancing network resilience and is fully backward compatible with the current Internet architecture. We will validate our architecture in a real world trial as well as participate strategically in carefully planned dissemination, standardization and exploitation activities to ensure that our architecture transcends from the lab to real world deployments.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

Without reducing the reliance on battery power, there is a significant roadblock in reaching trillions of devices. Future devices will need to be self-sufficient and operate without any battery swaps or any human intervention for decades. This will be made possible through harvesting of all the available ambient energy in the environment, for example:\nThermal energy associated with static and dynamic temperature differences;\nVibration energy e.g. from vehicles driving over a bridge or oil following through a pipe;\nLight energy from indoor artificial lighting. \nFor these predictions to be realised, the current roadblock is micro energy harvesting systems that can effectively capture all available energy using just one energy management device. The technical challenge is that these ambient energy sources have widely different electrical characteristics that must be managed e.g: photovoltaic and thermoelectric harvesters are low-voltage DC, resistive, \u201ctrickle\u201d sources; electrodynamic harvesters are high-voltage, inductive, \u201cpulsed\u201d sources whilst piezoelectric harvesters are high-voltage AC, capacitive, \u201cbursty\u201d sources.\nTrameto is a UK-based fabless semiconductor business that is focusing on bringing \u2018HarvestAll\u2019 to market.

It is based on a novel hybrid nanosintering process, which allows for the incorporation of a large variety of NCs and functionalization of glasses in different formats for various applications. Previous attempts to either grow NCs inside glass by a glass heat treatment or incorporate NCs during glass formation showed unconvincing results. In our nanosintering process, key enabling steps include reducing the sintering temperature, developing specialized NC core-shell structures and adjusting the glass composition, thus achieving a chemically inert environment and matching the refractive index of NCs and glass. This technology will be exploited to produce low-loss, NC-functionalized glass fibres. Fibre lasers are energy efficient and compact and offer maintenance-free operation, ultra-short pulses, high power, and low noise. Today\u2019s commercial fibre lasers are fabricated from robust, durable silica glass. The operation of oxide fibre lasers can be extended to an enormous spectral range (~400\u20133000 nm) by doping oxide glasses with laser-active nanocrystals optimized for particular laser wavelengths, thus enabling a huge variety of new applications.

The high risk of NCLas is mitigated by an interdisciplinary team with demonstrated experience in their fields and highly complementary backgrounds. We will address the project challenges in all its steps, from material synthesis to device demonstration.

{"text":"Title: FIWIN5G - FIber-Wireless Integrated Networks for 5th Generation delivery. Abstract: This European Training Network aims to produce the next generation of early stage researchers who will enable Europe to take a leading role in the development of future devices, systems and networks supporting the 5G high-speed wireless internet. To do this, researchers must be able to work in interdisciplinary teams, integrate their activities, share expertise, and promote a vision of a converged wireless and optical devices and networks that efficiently supports the services and applications being demanded. A large number of technologies and devices will need to converge, co-exist and interoperate, and most importantly, cooperate, if this vision is to be efficiently and cost-effectively realised. A key area within this next generation jigsaw is the integration of optical fibre networks and radio networks at mm-wave frequencies, to provide high-bandwidth front\/backhaul services and enable scalable and manageable networks without a highly complex interface structure and multiple overlaid protocols.\n\nFIWIN5G aims to provide doctoral students with the exposure to the range of skills, necessary to address these challenging demands. Deep technical knowledge but also key transferable skills common in entrepreneurship, management, financing as well as communication, and societal outreach. While becoming expects in one particular sub-domain, they must understand the broad context of their work, whether it is systems\/network engineers understanding the devices and technologies that make up the networks or device engineers understanding the networks in which their devices will function.\n\nWe draw together a range of world-leading partners, selected for their complimentary and excellence to offer a vital opportunity to advance industry\u2019s understanding and uptake of the key technologies in this area. To provide excellent training and diverse experience of research environments, all project involve a significant period of secondment and collaboration with an industry partner.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

While its technology is still considered in the early stages of development, it is already mature in the video game area.\nVR\/AR has the potential to change the way we do business, social interactions or education, but its applicability beyond gaming requires further development. An important field of research is the audio part. The importance of sound becomes evident when considering how people orientate themselves in space. Unlike seeing, hearing allows us to perceive instantly from all angles, and plays a leading role in giving us clues where to look at. To support natural orientation in VR\/AR, the visual and auditory information has to closely match, as otherwise the illusion is shattered and the experience is not convincing.\nVRACE aims at providing physically correct and perceptually convincing soundscapes in VR. This goal is pursued through dedicated training of ESRs in all VR-related domains, namely physical modelling, sound propagation, audio rendering and psychoacoustics. Specific research projects involve modelling of sound sources, such as musical instruments, voices, vehicles, colliding objects or environmental sound sources, studying sound propagation in complex interior spaces like concert halls and in outdoor environments such as urban or rural areas and investigating human perception and localisation of sounds.\nWith an estimated revenue of $80bn by 2025 (G&S) the demand for trained VR audio experts will increase rapidly. Besides advancing methodologies in this cutting-edge technology, VRACE will train 15 ESRs who will multiply and spread this knowledge in industry and academia. VRACE thus gives European industry a competitive edge in this global race.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: VESAFE - Enhanced 5G Vehicle to Vehicle Technologies for Safe and Reliable Connected Autonomous Vehicles Applications Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) holds great potentials for road safety and efficiency, but two major barriers need to be removed before its potentials can be fully unleashed: significantly enhanced vehicle to vehicle (eV2V) services with millimetre wave (mmWave) communications and reliable cooperative perception with autonomous vehicles (AV) sensors. However, the directional connectivity of mmWave presents new challenges for the whole protocol stack of V2V networks, while reliable cooperative perception requires novel design of deep learning (DL) models for object detection and fusion of sensor data from neighbour AVs. The above challenges underpinned by CAV demand a holistic design and tight integration of connected vehicles (CV) and AV technologies. \nThis innovative and multi-disciplinary project VESAFE will train the outstanding Fellow candidate to tackle the key challenges with complementary expertise and realize the full potentials of CAV. A novel cross-layer design is proposed for the research of 5th generation (5G) eV2V schemes with mmWave and reliable cooperative perception for advanced CAV safety applications: the eV2V schemes are AV oriented and greatly assisted by the AV cooperative perception, and the reliable cooperative perception is boosted by the awareness of V2V network conditions. And this project propose a novel integrated evaluation of 5G eV2V and CAV applications to support system design and performance characterization. Through the cutting-edge research, this innovative project will produce robust eV2V schemes and reliable cooperative perception solutions, make breakthrough on 5G V2V and CAV safety applications. It will significantly improve the Fellow\u2019s employability and career prospects, strengthen knowledge transfer, boosting the research and innovation (R&I) capacity and research quality, therefore contributing to Europe\u2019s competitiveness and growth in critical sectors of 5G\/6G and AV.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

Unexpected strong changes in this region can influence dramatically the performance and reliability of navigation and communication. However, the impact of those phenomena in this region is difficult to quantify accurately. On one hand, this region is too high for balloons and on the other hand it is too low for satellites. In this project, Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio waves will be used because they propagate between the Earth surface and the ionosphere with low attenuation. The researcher will push forward novel scientific understanding of the properties of the lower ionosphere and magnetosphere. She will: (1) determine whether the day-to-day variability of the VLF signal during sunrise can be explained by the ozone variability at its upper boundary, (2) find the yet unknown generation mechanism of VLF banded emissions, and (3) improve the detectability of galactic gamma-ray bursts, known as the most energetic phenomena in the universe. The project is strongly multidisciplinary, involving perspectives and concepts from astrophysics, magnetospheric, ionospheric, atmospheric physics and big data handling. This will be developed by the researcher within the frame of interaction and cooperation with the host and secondments. The results of this proposal have the potential to convey new perspectives in ionospheric and magnetospheric studies and provide some answers to long standing issues within the field of space weather, which has become of central importance in many aspects of human life and industry.

However, this agreement requires countries to cooperate tightly in order to keep a high level of security at their internal borders, as well as to share the responsibility of managing external borders. Such a variety of borders (land, sea and air) and current challenges requires a consistent approach to border surveillance, based on a plethora of heterogeneous assets. These can be manned or unmanned, ranging from sensors (optical, radar, IR) to unmanned platforms (UAV, UGV, USV or UUV), and need to be combined to offer an integrated situational picture of the area under surveillance and of their location. In order to effectively control their operation and manage the large amounts of data collected by them, new approaches for command and control need to be considered, allowing efficient interaction between the operator and the different assets in the field. CAMELOT proposes to develop and demonstrate different advanced command and control service modules for multiple platform domains, based on a SOA architecture that specifies internal and external interfaces, allowing the development of a modular and scalable command and control station, customisable to the user needs. This architecture can be based on results of previous studies and work or open architectures that may prove more suitable and the interfaces can take advantage of the standardisation work that has been done already. After the definition, CAMELOT partners will prototype service modules according to their expertise, background individual technologies and practitioner needs. These will be integrated progressively in specific testing along the project. This prototype development approach will culminate in 2 final demonstrations involving end users and relevant stakeholders, to achieve a maturity of TRL6 (for most individual technologies supporting the functionalities for border surveillance) and an IRL of 7 for CAMELOT.","gt":true,"conf":0.1}

PROTECTIVE makes two key contributions to achieve this enhanced situational awareness. Firstly it increases the computer security incident response team\u2019s (CSIRT) threat awareness through improved security monitoring and increased sharing of threat intelligence between organisations within a community. Secondly it ranks critical alerts based on the potential damage the attack can inflict on the threatened assets and hence to the organisations business. High impact alerts that target important hosts will have a higher priority than other alerts. Through the combination of these two measures organisations are better prepared to handle incoming attacks, malware outbreaks and other security problems and to guide the development of the prevention and remediation processes.\nThe PROTECTIVE system is designed to provide solutions for public domain CSIRTs and SME\u2019s who both have needs outside the mainstream of cyber security solution provision. Public CSIRTs needs arise in part because commercial tools do not address their unique requirements. This has created a shortfall, clearly articulated by ENISA, of tools with the required analytical and visualisation capabilities to enable public CSIRTs provide optimised services to their constituency. SME\u2019s also are vulnerable to cybercrime as they have limited resources to protect themselves and often a limited understanding of what needs to be done. Two pilots will be conducted to evaluate and validate the PROTECTIVE outcomes with CSIRTs from 3 National Research and Educational Networks (NRENs) and with SMEs via a managed security service provider (MSSP). \nThe PROTECTIVE consortium is constituted of 3 NRENs, 3 academic and four commercial partners from 8 countries so as to maximise the technical and commercial impact of the outputs and the dissemination and uptake of the results.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: SINHOPSI - Single-Hole Pumping in Silicon Abstract: A globally consistent system of measurement units and reference standards is a necessary underpinning feature of most technological, industrial and economic activities. In fact, to perform measurements of physical quantities, record and compare them in a consistent way, systems of units and standards have been historically developed and agreed upon. However, in the last few decades, the ever-increasing need for stability and reliability has determined a shift from standards based on material artefacts or prototypes towards those based on physical phenomena and true constants of nature. The focus of this proposal is the development of a novel quantum technology to generate highly accurate electric currents directly linked to the elementary charge. This could serve as the practical implementation for a quantum-based standard for the SI unit ampere, which is a long-standing goal in electrical metrology. Semiconductor nano-scale charge pumps have been used in the last three decades to generate accurate electric currents by clocking the transport of single electrons with driving oscillators. The main limitation to the fidelity of the charge transfer is ultimately ascribable to the poor spatial confinement of electrons that produces errors during the pumping cycle. In this project silicon-based nanotechnology will be employed to realize and operate the world-first charge pump based on the transfer of single holes rather than electrons. A hole carries the positive equivalent of an elementary charge, but its effective mass can be significantly larger than the electron's. The resulting tightly confined charge carrier wavefunction is expected to provide significant benefits in suppressing pumping errors. The primary objectives will be to develop the underpinning technology to fabricate and operate the first single-hole pump, and experimentally assess its performances in comparison to the well-established electron-based technology.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: NARRATIVENSCIENCE - Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives Abstract: The aim of this project is to understand the role of narrative in modern science. Narratives have appeared in many places in the human, social and natural sciences over the past two centuries. They can be found both in accounts of real situations and in simulations of virtual situations, in empirical work and in theorizing. It is clear that narratives have played important roles for scientists well beyond the simple act of reporting. Yet we lack an account of what kinds of thing scientists know from using narrative and how such \u2018narrative knowing\u2019 is constituted. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of medicine and evolutionary biology, even the study of those field narratives, as narratives, has been largely ignored by both historians of science and narrative scholars.\nWhat do scientists gain from using narratives, what functions do narratives play? Initial research shows that scientists have used narratives to figure out what fits together with what, and to create coherence amongst the elements in their research.  But the means of such ordering vary - from site to site, and from science to science. Narratives used to explore a path dependent system in nineteenth century biology used a different mode of ordering both from the configuring narratives of mid-twentieth century case studies in sociology, and from the \u2018how possibly\u2019 narratives of modern computer-based simulations. Such variety requires a broad project, using many case studies to explore the critical role that scientists\u2019 narratives have played in modern science. Making sense of such variety offers an ambitious challenge. But while there is surely no simple answer to why scientists use narratives, all these notions of narrative ordering do have something in common. They suggest that narratives function not just to describe and report as one might expect, they play a much more important role in answering scientists\u2019s own questions and so - in various ways - in providing scientific explanations.","gt":true,"conf":0.1}
{"text":"Title: GLYCOSENSE - Polymer brush sensing arrays for the identification of pathogens Abstract: Surfaces with the capacity for selective recognition of particular pathogens would offer great potential in a number of biomedical applications, including diagnostic devices. Mammalian cells are decorated with a carbohydrate-rich layer, the glycocalyx, which facilitates cellular recognition. Carbohydrate-binding proteins can interact with these sugar motifs to facilitate highly selective recognition, a strategy which is exploited by many viral and bacterial pathogens. Such species have evolved to display recognition units on their surfaces which may interact with considerable affinity with glycan structures displayed on cellular surfaces. This molecular recognition constitutes a key step in the processes of infection or toxicity, and is therefore an attractive target for the development of diagnostic devices. In this project, Dr Clare Mahon proposes to develop surface-tethered polymer brushes which will mimic the glycocalyx in terms of facilitating adhesion of pathogens. Through the incorporation of different fluorophores, the surfaces will be used to construct sensing arrays which will enable the rapid and cost-effective identification of water-borne pathogens and common respiratory pathogens.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

This is especially important for the major pan-industry components of our information infrastructure: processors, programming languages, operating systems, etc.\n\nThe basic problem is that conventional engineering techniques suffice only to make systems that *usually* work.

Using these, ELVER will build tools for analysis of system software, develop techniques for mathematical proof of safety and security properties, and explore improved systems programming languages.  ELVER will build on successful collaborations with ARM, IBM, and the C\/C++ ISO standards committees.

{"text":"Title: MolCellTissMech - Molecular and cellular determinants of cell monolayer mechanics Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are amongst the simplest tissues in the body, yet they play fundamental roles in adult organisms where they separate the internal environment from the external environment and in development when the intrinsic forces generated by cells within the monolayer drive tissue morphogenesis. The mechanics of these simple tissues is dictated by the cytoskeletal and adhesive proteins that interface the constituent cells into a tissue-scale mechanical syncitium. Mutations in these proteins lead to diseases with fragilised epithelia. However, a quantitative understanding of how subcellular structures govern monolayer mechanics, how cells sense their mechanical environment and what mechanical forces participate in tissue morphogenesis is lacking.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, my lab devised a new technique to study the mechanics of load-bearing monolayers under well-controlled mechanical conditions while allowing imaging at subcellular, cellular and tissue resolutions. Using this instrument, my proposal aims to understand the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics as well as the cellular behaviours that drive tissue morphogenesis.  I will focus on four objectives: 1) discover the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics, 2) characterise monolayer mechanics, 3) dissect how tension is sensed by monolayers, and 4) investigate the biophysics of individual cell behaviours participating in tissue morphogenesis.\n\nTogether these studies will enable us to understand how monolayer mechanics is affected by changes in single cell behaviour, subcellular organisation, and molecular turnover. This multi-scale characterisation of monolayer mechanics will set the stage for new theoretical descriptions of living tissues involving both molecular-scale phenomena (cytoskeletal turnover, contractility, and protein unfolding) operating on short time-scales and rearrangements due to cell-scale phenomena (cell intercalation, cell division) acting on longer times.","gt":true,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: Airport IQ - Situation-Aware Mobile Platform for Airport Collaborative Decision-Making Abstract: The economic costs of aircraft delays in Europe have been estimated at 1.25Bn Euros per year. Aircraft delays also result in environmental costs: aircraft holding or queuing with engines on, resulting in excess environmental emissions and air quality or noise impact, unnecessary ground movements and activation of auxiliary power units.\nAirport IQ will develop a mobile information sharing system connecting back-end A-CDM systems with mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and other wearable devices) carried by ground staff. The system will provide the right information at the right place and time to the right people, making it easier for planners to make optimal use of resources. This will help reduce primary and reactionary delays, improve the reliability of estimates, and allow airlines to make smarter decisions about turnaround buffers, that will be shorter than before.  Airport IQ will also offer a simple way to simulate turnaround activities, making it possible to run operational exercises using the same mobile tools, which will simplify and improve the quality of training, as well as providing the basis for designing longer-term improvements in ground handling processes. \nThe solution has the potential to create significant economic and environmental savings for the entire air transport value chain, as demonstrated by pilot trials  to be organized in 3 European airports (Lisboa, Heathrow and Targu Mures), involving real end-users (i.e. ground handling and other airport staff) using \u201clive\u201d onsite data.

{"text":"Title: COSMOS - Control and measurement of single macromolecules in space and time Abstract: The desire to \u201cfreely suspend the constituents of matter\u201d in order to study their behaviour can be traced back over 200 years to Lichtenberg\u2019s diaries. From radio-frequency ion traps to optical tweezing of colloidal particles, existing methods to trap matter in free space or solution rely on the use of external fields that often strongly perturb the integrity of a macromolecule in solution. Recently, I invented the \u2018electrostatic fluidic trap\u2019, a \u201cfield-free\u201d principle that supports stable, non-destructive confinement of single macromolecules in room temperature fluids, representing a paradigm shift in a nearly century-old field. The spatio-temporal dynamics of a single electrostatically trapped molecule reveals fundamental information on its properties, e.g., size and electrical charge. The charge of a macromolecule is in turn a strong function of its 3D conformation - the molecular basis of biological function. I now aim to develop a new platform to study 3D macromolecular structure and temporal conformation by measuring the electrical charge of a single trapped molecule in real time, using both optical microscopy and electrical detection. Beyond the conformational dynamics of a single molecule, we will also examine interactions between two or more molecules, and the detection of minute structural differences between closely related molecular isoforms. We will further develop a novel approach to electrical transport measurements on single molecules aimed at generating for the first time a catalog of \u2018electrical signatures\u2019 for biomolecules in solution. The ability to experimentally link electrical charge and molecular structure will not only open up a new physical dimension in our understanding of macromolecules, but also advance the development of ultrasensitive, high-throughput molecular sensors for biomedical detection and analytics, potentially enabling an optical or electrical \u201csingle-snapshot\u201d read-out of the proteome or transcriptome of a single cell.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

This will allow end-to-end network and service elements to mix in multi-vendor, heterogeneous technology and resource environments. Market fragmentation has resulted in a multitude of network operators each focused on different countries and regions. This makes it difficult to create infrastructure services spanning multiple countries, such as virtual connectivity or compute resources, as no single operator has a footprint everywhere.\n\n5GEx aims to enable collaboration between operators, regarding 5G infrastructure services, with the view to introducing a unification via NFV\/SDN compatible multi-domain orchestration by producing (i) an open platform enabling cross-domain orchestration of services over these multiple domains, with a set of open source software tools and extensions that can be utilised outside the scope of 5GEx; (ii) a Sandbox Network enabling experimentation and validation of the devised architecture, mechanisms, and business models; (iii) a proof-of-innovation multi-domain platform enabling multiple 5G use-cases and realistic scenarios that demonstrate the orchestration of complex end-to-end Infrastructure as a Service across multiple carriers; (iv) contributions to standards bodies of concepts learned during the development and experimentation of the project; (v) input to stimulate the telecom and IT industry stakeholders by actively promoting adoption of 5GEx\u2019s open solutions.\n\nSuch 5G infrastructure services will provide a crucial role in making 5G happen as they provide the foundation of all cloud and networking services. 5GEx aims to enable, through operator collaboration, a unified European infrastructure service market integrating multiple operators and technologies, where service provisioning is fast and automated and which results in stronger economy via economies of scale.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

Additionally, nanocellulose (NC) based printed electronics, produced mainly from wood pulp, offer better printability and performance than paper. Therefore, the integration of NC-based printed electronics and biosensors is a promising source of innovation in the biomedical industry. In GREENSENSE we propose the development of a sustainable NC-based biosensing platform for Drug-of-Abuse (DoA) analysis, that integrates high-added value printed electronic components (a new biosensor, an NFC communication system, an energy storage system and a display) with a silicon microchip to provide it with multi sensor data processing, autonomy and wireless communication and that is easy for the user to read.  The main goal of the project will be the use of NC as: substrate for the printed electronics, lamination film for the encapsulation of the final device and as active component in the formulation of functional inks (conductive, electrochemical, electrolyte and dielectric). In all cases the NC surface will be functionalized to be printable, with good barrier properties and compatible with the functional inks (bioactive, conductive, dielectric, electrochemical, electrochromic and electrolyte).

It is a major contributor to EU GDP and its size continues to grow fueled by demand from consumers to many industries. Despite its many positive impacts, the industry also faces some challenges connected with the enormous quantity of raw materials that it needs for sustainability, the huge quantity of Waste Electrical, Electronics Equipment (WEEE) generated and the threat of competition from Asia. To sustain its growth, to manage the impact of WEEE and to face the competition from Asia, the industry needs innovations in key areas. One such area is the drive for ultra-miniaturisation\/ultlra-functionality of equipment. The key current road block\/limitation to achieving the goal of ultra-miniaturisation\/functionality is how to increase the component density on the printed circuit board (PCB). This is currently limited by the availability of hyper fine pitch solder powder pastes. FineSol aims to deliver at first stage an integrated production line for solder particles with size 1-10 \u03bcm and to formulate solder pastes containing these particles. Thus, by proper printing methods (e.g. screen and jet printing) the fabrication of  PCBs with more than double component density will be achieved. Consequently, this would effectively enable more than a doubling of the functions available on electronic devices such as cell phones, satellite navigation systems, health devices etc. The successful completion of the FineSol project would lift the ultra-miniaturisation\/functionality road block and also enable reduction in raw material usage, reduction in WEEE, reduction in pollution and associated health costs and also a major reduction in EU energy demand with all its indirect benefits for environment and society.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}

The immediate and extensive costs of violence targeting women perpetuate the existing gender hierarchies by setting boundaries on women\u2019s movement, mobility, presence: that is, on their use of urban space. In addition to restrictions in mainstream social life, gendered violence is a systemic source of experiencing helplessness, humiliation, and distress which overall are a fundamental component of women\u2019s wellbeing. VISMEM will investigate the impact of place-based memories of violence among diverse women for their use of urban space, and interrogate the utility of visual methods for understanding that impact. More precisely, the study uses visual methods to explore diverse women\u2019s everyday negotiations of space in Istanbul, focusing in particular on their movements in relation to three research sites where forms of violence against women have occurred. VISMEM\u2019s overall objective is to develop a conceptual framework and visual tools for multisector policy and research engagement with memory as a key means to locate, assess, and ameliorate women's differential experience of violence and wellbeing in the city. Women in different social and spatial settings remember (and forget) the physical and mental effects of violence through personal experience and through popular accounts of its effects.

{"text":"Title: MEESST - MHD Enhanced Entry System for Space Transportation Abstract: (Re-)entry into planetary atmospheres represents one of the most critical phases of space missions, involving high thermal loads on the vehicle surface and radio communication blackout which can last for minutes. As demonstrated with previous scientific studies, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) provides a framework for tackling both issues: high enough electromagnetic (EM) fields can be used to reduce heat fluxes and create a magnetic windowing able to mitigate the blackout. However, the translation of those ideas into an operational radically-new science-enabled technology to be used onboard spacecrafts has not been achieved yet. MEESST aims at filling the gap between science and technology towards the development of a first demonstrator implementing active magnetic shielding. To this end, a disruptive device consisting of a compact cryostat integrating a superconductive magnet able to generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields will be designed, manufactured, tested in on-ground experimental plasma facilities and via numerical simulations relying upon improved models.

The currently limited accuracy, however, is hindering the progress towards societal-changing technologies such as telecommunications beyond 5G or precise earth mapping.\nOptical atomic clocks based on optical frequency combs \u2013 Nobel prize in Physics, 2005 to Hall and H\u00e4nsch \u2013 are the only technology capable of providing timing accurate up to 10^(-18) seconds, answering such a demand of time precision. The realisation of such clocks in portable scale is expected to change the technology landscape.\nMicro-combs \u2013 based on miniature optical resonators \u2013 have galvanized the attention of the world over the past ten years with the promise to realise the full potential of frequency combs in a compact form. \nHowever, these devices still do not meet the demand of practical atomic clocks which require reliable optical sources and currently depend on bulky pulsed lasers, which are well-known for their robustness but unfit for portable applications.\nDeveloping energy-efficient micro-combs with the reliability and versatility of control of modern pulsed lasers will require to surpass the intrinsic limitations of the nonlinear physics exploited so far for their generation.\nHere we propose a high-gain\/ high-risk research plan which steers from the state-of-the-art and builds on a different physics for developing micro-combs with control capabilities beyond the current miniature solutions.\nSpecifically, we will exploit the generation of localised waves called temporal laser cavity-solitons in complex resonators exhibiting lasing and parametric nonlinear interactions. Such a setting is mostly unexplored and this proposal will demonstrate the unique features of these waves and their general impact in broader physics. Eventually, this study will pave the way to a class of robust micro-combs which can be controlled with user-friendly machine learning approaches.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}

{"text":"Title: ssmscaifa - The Making of Modernist Resistance, 1880-1950 Abstract: The vibrant diversity of an increasingly global modernity owes much to the cross-cultural exchanges between British and Indian modernists during their collaborations in civil rights, anti-colonial, and anti-fascist activism from the 1880s to the 1950s. The proposed project examines the shifting nature of literary and political contributions to activist movements made by four such networks of British and Indian modernists to illuminate their integral role in creating what I contend is a distinctively modernist resistance. As early as the 1880s, theosophists from Britain partnered with renowned Indian spiritualists to bridge cultural gaps between colonizer and colonized through shared mystical experiences to emphasize an innate unity among human beings. By 1919, however, the disillusionment following World War I coupled with India\u2019s outrage about the Amritsar Massacre in which General Dyer and his troops opened fire killing hundreds of innocent Indians, supplanted such yearnings for unity with efforts to protect democratic freedoms from threats by right-wing extremists through a secular socialist resistance. Mulk Raj Anand, initially drawn to the liberal humanism of the Bloomsbury Group eventually joined the radical socialists of India\u2019s Progressive Writers Association in 1936. Women like Sarojini Naidu and Virginia Woolf fought for women\u2019s equality and opportunities to join in anti-right-wing resistance. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, influenced by the socialist ideologies of the Fabian Society, incorporated them into Indian nationalism and governance. This study explores the relationship between the ideologies of these networks to establish what the shift from spiritualism to secular socialist nationalism reveals about the nature of modernist resistance and the conditions of modernity that inspired it. The world view underpinning this resistance was integral in defining the post-war identities of Britain and India as secular socialist-leaning democracies.","gt":true,"conf":0.0}

The EU re-treading industry is valued at \u20ac1.2bn (2015) but is declining due to the influx of Chinese tyres leading to the loss of highly-skilled jobs.\n\nThe low-cost imported tyres cost on average \u20ac80 per tyre compared to \u20ac300-500 from a premium manufacturer. The temptation to buy these low-cost tyres is clear, however they are manufactured from poor quality materials with tread patterns that underperform. The ethos of cheap tyres is \u2018use and replace\u2019, whereas premium tyres are built to be re-treaded to increase lifetime. As a result, imported tyres are not cost effective over the lifetime of the tyres due to poor fuel economy and performance. Use of premium tyres and re-treading over the use and replace model needs to be encouraged to increase safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nSilent Sensors are an innovative IoT company that are working on a tyre traceability solution to remove the logistical burden of re-treading for FOs. We are manufacturing UHF\/NFC RFID tags \u2018OnTrack\u2019 to embed directly into tyres which provides each tyre with a permanent, unique ID for life. Our tags can store data from the manufacturing process and key events during operational use such as repairs etc. This comprehensive history for each tyre makes it easier for FOs to plan their tyre re-treads. This data also makes the re-tread process simpler as the tyre history will speed-up integrity tests.\n\nOnTrack is the only tyre traceability solution that offers NFC \u2013 empowering employees to interrogate tyres with just a smartphone.

However, there are a number of research challenges that need to be addressed for a successful deployment of 5G\/B5G wireless networks: even if the theoretical background of massive MIMO is by now rather complete, the actual performance characterization and measurements of mmW antenna arrays has not yet been fully addressed at either the component or system level; mmW radio channel measurements have\nbeen performed but with limited time delay resolution, single antennas and over single radio links; and mmW bands have been considered for mobile communications, but the level of detail and diversity of BEs necessary for meaningful mmW SC deployment has not been fully exploited.

Regarding the communication layer interoperability, this project intends to develop and evaluate function-driven communication frameworks. Moreover, this project will develop and verify new data integration and analytic techniques for enhancing power grid operations. These developed frameworks and methods will be extensively tested and evaluated in 4 well-equipped Laboratories at HWU, EPRI, ICCS, and CAS. They will not only support the SGAM Framework, but also complement and enhance International Standards. \nOverall, the main objective of this project is to coordinate the action of 5 Universities and 3 enterprises, working in the field of ICT and smart grid from both EU and China, to build and test sophisticated ICT, thereby facilitating the successful implementation of smart grid applications.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}
{"text":"Title: SOLOMON - Self-Organisation and Learning Online in Mobile Observation Networks Abstract: Smart cameras are embedded devices combining a visual sensor, a processing unit and a communication interface, allowing the processing of images on the device, such that only aggregated information, instead of raw video data, is transmitted. Smart camera networks are typically used for large-scale high value security applications such as person tracking in airports or amusement parks. However, current smart cameras are expensive and have only very limited mobility, acting as a barrier to their wider adoption. The SOLOMON project is driven by the rising demand for rapid-deployment camera networks which can adapt to provide security in the context of unforeseen situations and unfolding scenarios. This is evidenced by the rapid growth of leading body-cam company Edesix Ltd, whose VideoBadge technology is being adopted by police forces worldwide . However, recent research advances in smart camera networks have not yet been realised in dynamic body-worn camera networks, and still rely on prohibitively expensive static hardware. In the SOLOMON project we envision a novel type of lightweight, inexpensive smart camera network suitable for rapid deployment and reconfiguration, where low-cost camera devices such as Edesix\u2019s VideoBadge, are paired with the processing capabilities of smartphones. These are then worn by people (e.g. police, security guards) or mounted on mobile robots. This not only lowers cost, but allows us to introduce a feedback loop between the sensing cameras and the acting people\/robots, enabling the camera network to adapt to changes during runtime, for example to prioritise or cover newly relevant areas sufficiently. Novel techniques in collective decision making and self-organisation as well as multi-objective online learning will need to be developed, in order to achieve this vision.","gt":true,"conf":0.7}

Urban mobility faces significant challenges from two global megatrends: growing urbanisation and ageing population. Light electric vehicles (EL-Vs) could represent a viable solution to traffic congestion and pollution in cities. However, their successful integration into the urban transport system requires a clear understanding of the individual consumer needs.\nBy involving human science and transportation specialists, the STEVE partners have developed a framework to interpret these forces. Focus will be on mature cities of medium size (Torino: 800.000 inhabitants, Villach 60.000, Calvi\u00e0 60.000, Venaria 35.000), where STEVE will generate data to support the design of next generation EL Vs, and provoke the mind-shift necessary for swift market penetration of them.\n\nThe primary idea of STEVE is to implement and test a human-centric approach to electro-Mobility-as-a-Service (eMaaS), according to the \u201cMove2Me\u201d vision of the consortium. This will provide low-cost and financially sustainable EL V solutions and \u201cgamified\u201d services, to enhance users\u2019 awareness, engagement and vehicle energy efficiency.\nA core item of STEVE is a low-cost electric quadricycle developed by a worldwide OEM in Turin, with start-of-production expected in 2018 at a market price of \u20ac8000. The quadricycle will integrate high-technology contents with respect to the current competitors, and will be pilot-tested, together with many other EL-Vs, during extensive demonstration phases in the four STEVE cities\nSTEVE will guarantee a strong impact in terms of business development and jobs, and enhance the European competitiveness in the eMaaS sector while also leveraging Manufacturing.\n\nThe consortium will also give a primary role to SMEs: while large enterprises will provide the underlying technologies, the services will be mainly designed and operated by SMEs, deeply involved in the local supply chains and adaptable to the specific customers\u2019 needs.","gt":true,"conf":0.1}

Yet a generation later, almost every facet of our individual, public and -now- online life are dominated by the fast-pacing digital transformation. Last year we saw the privacy and data of millions of social media users compromised with little to no accountability for those responsible, national elections influenced by users in different states, news outlets struggling to convince readers of facts, and the European Union taking proactive measure to protect the data privacy of its citizens in its first transnational regulatory action. Yet, the digital literacies and capabilities necessary for citizens to thrive in a digital society and act as responsible and effective participants, are unequally distributed across the European cultural, economic and social strata, with the public sphere consequently rapidly dissolving. ARTSFORMATION will respond through research, innovation and applied artistic practice to these societal challenges, by equitably developing the capacity of artists and citizens alike -including those from geographically remote, socio-economically excluded minority, refugee and migrant backgrounds- to respond cohesively in making their communities and groups resilient and adaptive in the 4th Industrial Revolution.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: A-LITHIA - Plastic nanoscale electronics via novel fabrication paradigms Abstract: Nanogap electrodes have been a highly attractive research area for over 25 years. This is mainly due to their potential for realising next generation nanodevices and circuit elements with lower power consumption, faster speed, and higher level of integration, as well as investigating the fundamental properties of materials at the nano- or even molecular level. However, the lack of a facile, inexpensive, high throughput technique for the manufacturing of dissimilar nanogap electrodes has hindered their commercial and scientific exploitation.\nIt is exactly at this junction that I strive to make significant advances with this proposal, by first implementing a novel patterning technique, adhesion lithography (a-Lith), to manufacture large aspect ratio (>100,000) metal electrode nanogaps (<50 nm) on a variety of substrates and then by fabricating and fully characterising nanoscale devices that will allow both understanding of the relevant device physics, alongside, advancing in device performance. \nHerein, I will firstly further develop the a-Lith key processing steps in order to establish a reliable protocol for the controlled geometry and uniform nanogap formation. Then I will follow a multidisciplinary research trajectory aiming at the development of high performance co-planar nano-scale electronic devices. Targeted proof-of-concept applications include radio frequency rectifying Schottky diodes, non-volatile ferroelectric tunnel junction memories, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, piezoelectric nanogenerators and molecular nano-junctions, the architectures and dimensions of which would be difficult or far too expensive to obtain with traditional patterning techniques (e.g. e-beam lithography).

When filming in indoor environments, auxiliary devices as cable cams, camera rails, jibs, scaffolds or lifting platforms are being employed, enabling to realize special aerial camera shots.  With the rise of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), commonly known as drones, CIs are increasingly focusing on its use outdoors, providing significant advantages over current photography and filming techniques such as widening the creative possibilities and freedom of camera movement, less invasive and risky compared to auxiliary devices and affordable.\n\nHowever, RPAS cannot be professionally employed indoors by the CIs. Existing RPAS lack of a precise, robust and affordable indoor positioning system (IPS) as well as advanced safety features. Without a good IPS the control of the RPAS in indoor environments is particularly difficult and even unsafe. Currently, there are three IPS suitable for RPAS, but these are too expensive (\u20ac200k), or present large limitations (e.g. sensitive to light conditions) for its usage by CI SMEs. This jeopardizes the creative possibilities of CI and their competitiveness.\n\nHence, the main goal of AiRT project is to provide the European CI SMEs a tool that, by expanding their creative spaces will help them to offer new services, which in turn will increase their changes to grow within the European and international market. To accomplish this objective, AiRT project will develop the world\u00b4s first indoor RPAS specifically designed for professional use by the CIs.\n\nAs a result, over 900.000 European CI firms will benefit from the transfer of the latest advances in IPS, 3D scene reconstruction, navigation and active \/ passive safety measures into an intelligent indoor RPAS, being able to avoid both static and dynamic objects. In addition AiRT system could be programmed in order to fly autonomously, enabling the CIs to focus on the camera control.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

Users can reach into the levitating matter, feel it, manipulate it, and hear how they deform it\nwith all feedback originating from the levitating object's position in mid-air, as it would with objects in real life.

This  allows decoupling the control and user planes of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and achieving the benefits of Cloud-RAN without the enormous fronthaul latency restrictions. The use of end-to-end network slicing mechanisms will allow sharing the 5G ESSENCE infrastructure among multiple operators\/vertical industries and customising its capabilities on a per-tenant basis. The versatility of the architecture is enhanced by high-performance virtualisation techniques for data  isolation, latency reduction and resource efficiency, and by orchestrating lightweight virtual resources enabling efficient Virtualised Network Function placement and live migration. 5G ESSENCE leverages knowledge, SW modules and prototypes from various 5G-PPP Phase-1 projects,SESAME being particularly relevant.

{"text":"Title: IntelliGen - Advanced control platform for next generation Free Piston Engines (FPEs) for clean and efficient power generation Abstract: Clean and efficient Free Piston Engines (FPEs) offer numerous advantages over traditional ICE architectures. Despite some high-profile attempts (Volvo, General Motors, Toyota), FPEs have not yet realised large scale commercial applications as it is very challenging to control the motion of the piston sufficiently. This is a substantial engineering challenge requiring multiple control operations to be performed repeatedly in a millisecond timescale to combat piston drift. There is a need for a flexible platform technology that enables FPEs to address the large range of potential use-cases, and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. IntelliGen is a ground-breaking platform technology for precise control of Free Piston Engines (FPEs), an emerging class of ICEs, which enables higher fuel efficiency, ultra-low emissions, and reduction in the operating cost of power. Furthermore, FPEs are compatible with low carbon and renewable fuels. Due to inherent problems with controlling the variable motion of the piston, commercial FPE development programmes had stalled, until now. IntelliGen enables precise control of piston motion and allows FPE architectures to be designed and scaled to suit any application including automotive and mobile power generation. The revolutionary platform unlocks the vast potential residing in FPEs, paving the way for the next 4 billion engines and a cleaner, more sustainable future. During the phase 1 feasibility study, Libertine will establish a sound go-to-market strategy and supply chain, and will outline further development plans.

{"text":"Title: Comedy and Politics - The Comedy of Political Philosophy.  Democratic Citizenship, Political Judgment, and Ideals in Political Practice. Abstract: Despite the rich history and contemporary relevance of the intersection of comedy, political practices, and political thought, comedy has thus far not received sustained attention in the field of political philosophy. This research programme will address this lacuna by developing parallels between (i) the specific outlook on human action offered by comedies and (ii) the perspective of a tradition of political thought known as political realism.\n\nThe overall objective of this research programme is to demonstrate that comedy reflects the theoretical and methodological commitments of political realism, and to establish comedy\u2019s contribution to realism by drawing out realism\u2019s transformative potential. \n\nThree specific research objectives will be combined to support the overall objective. (a) The first objective will develop an account of democratic citizenship informed by comedy by exploring Aristophanes\u2019 comedies. (b) The second objective will develop an account of political judgment informed by comedy, by analysing Machiavelli\u2019s comedies and political writings in relation to each other. (c) The third objective will develop an account of the relation between ideals and practice in politics informed by comedy by drawing on theoretical reflections on comedy by Hegel, Vischer, and Marx. \n\nEach of the specific research objectives corresponds to a central feature of political realism. By developing these objectives through comedy, the researcher will explicate structural parallels between comedy and political realism. In each of the specific objectives, the transformative potential inherent in comedy will be elucidated. In doing so, the researcher will use insights derived from this parallel to develop a more nuanced understanding of political realism\u2019s potential to conceptualize social transformation. Thus comedy transpires as the means through which the full potential of realism for political philosophy as a whole can be grasped for the first time.","gt":true,"conf":0.0}

The modified PAN catalysts developed at DMU has eliminated the need for iron removal post treatment and has broadened the pH range of application, whilst enabling continuous flow processes favoured by industry. In recent years, several reports have demonstrated the use of microwave and ultraviolet radiation to promote the oxidative degradation of bio-refractory wastes due to their advantages of speeding up the reaction, high-efficiency with no pollution to the environment. Nevertheless the use of microwaves in catalysis and in the water and wastewater industry remains at laboratory scale and therefore requires further in depth research. The major challenges in the water\/wastewater industries are centered on the poor penetration depth of microwaves. In the project, we propose to design a UV and microwave assisted reactor which overcomes this scale-up problem. The design of the scalable microwave reactor will not only add new knowledge to the sector but open up new areas of industrial application for microwaves.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

Agriculture is the biggest source of pesticides and nitrate pollution in European fresh waters. The overarching objective of WATERPROTECT is to contribute to effective uptake and realisation of management practices and mitigation measures to protect drinking water resources. Therefore WATERPROTECT will create an integrative multi-actor participatory framework including innovative instruments that enable actors to monitor, to finance and to effectively implement management practices and measures for the protection of water sources. We propose seven case studies involving multiple actors in implementing good practices (land management, farming, product stewardship, point source pollution prevention) to ensure safe drinking water supply. The seven case studies cover different pedo-climatic conditions, different types of farming systems, different legal frameworks, larger and smaller water collection areas across the EU. In close cooperation with actors in the field in the case studies (farmers associations, local authorities, water producing companies, private water companies, consumer organisations) and other stakeholders (fertilizer and plant protection industry, environment agencies, nature conservation agencies, agricultural administrations) at local and EU level, WATERPROTECT will develop innovative water governance models investigating alternative pathways from focusing on the \u2018costs of water treatment\u2019 to \u2018rewarding water quality delivering farming systems\u2019.

Abstract: Broadband has become an essential part of 21st-century infrastructure. New cloud services are making it a necessity for starting and growing small businesses, as well as advancing a wide variety of industries. However, more than half of the world's population still does not have access to internet being at a disadvantage; and the digital gap will continue to grow wider. Traditional wireless networks are expensive to install or expand and consequently low subscriber areas and less lucrative developing regions will likely never see cellular access. As an alternative, satellite access offers more than 5,000 times the spectrum compared to terrestrial networks -plus it is global and cover land, sea and air. Nevertheless, this technology is held back by current ground-based terminal (antenna) solutions that are expensive, single beam, require high power and have limited scalability.\n\nIsotropic\u2019s Radio Frequency (RF) Beamformer technology is a highly innovative system that exploits the science of transformational optics to provide the self-aligning ability of large phased array antennas but with significantly reduced complexity. This allows for drastically reduced cost and power consumption whilst increasing operational flexibility and performance. RF Beamformer is an ultra-low cost antenna technology that enables an optimised ground-based terminal that is otherwise currently missing in the industry development roadmap.\n\nTo date we have received $6M in venture capital and following successful results from founder\u00b4s research, the technology has reached TRL 5. We are now looking for funds to following our detailed product roadmap, translate our technology to products and bring satellite connectivity to the mass market by 2021.\n\nThe proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME Instrument fits into our overall plan to reach the market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a fast sound wider deployment of RF Beamformer and its market uptake.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

Currently available wireless technology cannot support these future demands, and so there is an urgent need to develop new technology platforms that are cost and energy efficient to enable ubiquitous ultra-broadband wireless communications seamlessly integrated with high-speed fibre-optic networks, paving the way for 100 Gbps datarates in the long term. The frequency spectrum currently in use is not expected to be suitable to accommodate the predicted future data-rate requirements, and therefore there is a need to embrace higher frequency bands, above 60 GHz and up to 1 THz. iBROW aims at developing a novel, low cost, energy-efficient and compact ultra-broadband short-range wireless communication transceiver technology, capable of addressing predicted future network usage requirements. This will be pursued through the exploitation of Resonant Tunnelling Diode (RTD) devices which represent the fastest pure solid-state electronic devices operating at room temperature with reported working frequencies exceeding 1 THz. Through the development of a unified technology that can be integrated into both ends of the wireless link, namely consumer portable devices and fibre-optic supported base-stations, the project aims at increasing the RTD output power, optical detection efficiency and energy efficiency at target frequencies, developing a methodology for low cost RTD manufacturing on a silicon platform, photonic integration and packaging, as well as identifying appropriate communication methods and architectures to enable its deployment in 10 Gbps short-range wireless communication devices in short term and paving the way for 100 Gbps in long term for both the mm-wave and THz frequency bands, seamlessly integrated with optical fibre networks","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

The new compounds are particularly suitable for the fabrication of OLEDs via cheap solution-processing techniques and have so far reached 27% external quantum efficiency, a record for any solution-processed device. The new complexes have a linear, rotationally flexible structure, and it is this rotation that allows 100% of the excitation energy to be harvested, by a new emission mechanism (\u201crotationally accessed spin-state inversion\u201d, RASI). OLEDs are widely used as flat-screen displays (TVs, smartphones), a multi-billion dollar market worldwide.

Magnetron technology does not allow for the automatic adjustment of power level to match the load variations. These limitations have a huge cost to industrial microwave processes and there are calls for more efficient solutions.  Across Europe, microwaves consume over 9.6 TWh of electrical energy annually.\nF&M seeks to upscale its 200W solid state continuous wave microwave system to address these limitations. The 1kW gallium nitride based microwave system will save at least 25% on electricity consumption, operate at more than 70% efficiency, allow automatic adjustment of power level in response to load variations and significantly reduce equipment size. It will also provide increased lifespan eliminating the need for frequent and costly replacements.  With all these excellent features and performance advantages, our product also comes at a very competitive cost to the user which lies in the same range with the magnetron systems.\nSolid state microwave technology can be used in moisture meters, medical applications like RF-Surgery, and microwave ovens for the manufacture of electronic assemblies.

Existing low cost antennas trade-off the cost of the antenna against the requirement for much more expensive satellite bandwidth per Mbps transmitted. Their performance is also too limited for use in certain geographical areas (particularly at large skew angles).  \n\nThe overall objective of this project therefore is to successfully refine and scale up for market readiness the world\u2019s first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile phased antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move. This will enable us to gain a substantial market share in the \u20ac 1.185bn Broadband Satellite Communications-on-the-Move (COTM) market and the associated antenna market which amounts to \u20ac0.39bn. Both of which are growing rapidly. We predict that we can achieve a 2.5% market share by 2020, generating total revenues of \u20ac134m and a cumulative EBITDA of \u20ac63m, creating 781 jobs. Our prototype system technology is demonstrated and proven in a relevant environment and at TRL6. This project will allow us to demonstrate the market disruptive system in an operational environment and then fully scale up the system to market readiness.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: QUSON - Quantum Sensing with Quantum Optical Networks Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits effects such as entanglement to enhance the sensitivity of measurement devices. In the last decade we have witnessed a significant advance in experimental platforms such as trapped ion setups and superconducting circuits. These systems are never free from noise and dissipation, however, interactions between qubits and photons or phonons can be controlled with lasers or external fields. Even in strong dissipative regimes, cooperative effects may induce complex quantum dynamics with emergent phenomena such as non-equilibrium phase transitions and multistability. The question then arises whether we can exploit those many-body effects in robust metrological protocols. \nMy project will address this question in two main scenarios corresponding to different limits of a network of qubits coupled to photonic cavities. Firstly, I will consider a limit of weak coupling, in which cooperative radiative decay leads to the generation of entanglement. Secondly, I will investigate networks of qubits strongly coupled to photonic cavities. I will identify, and systematically investigate, points close to non-equilibrium phase transitions in which the abrupt response of the system can be used to accurately measure properties of driving fields. The project requires a rigorous theoretical description of the qubit-cavity network. Approximations such as a mean-field theory can be used for a preliminary study. However, to achieve my goals I will need to properly describe quantum correlations across the system. I will address this challenge by using Matrix Product States methods - an advanced quasi-exact numerical technique. \nMy reference systems will be trapped ion setups and superconducting qubits coupled to microwave resonators. In my project, I will systematically investigate their performance as quantum sensors under realistic conditions. My work will lead to proposals for the accurate measurement of microwave fields, magnetic fields and ultra-weak forces.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: Photonic Radar - Implementation of Long Reach Hybrid Photonic Radar System and convergence over FSO and PON Networks Abstract: The conventional radar systems, operating in mm-wave (MMW) i.e. beyond 30 GHz, are exposed to high free-path losses (\u2265 1 dB\/km) and the situation becomes more punitive under severe environment conditions, for instance, Heavy rain and fog. Moreover, the traditional radar distribution networks are realized with conventional cables or space-feeds that results in a massive, complex and inflexible system. To overcome these issues, the hybrid photonic-based radar system (PHRAD) emerges as a promising candidate, providing low-loss, immunity to EM interference and high bandwidth capacity. These robust properties of photonics play a vital role in realization of PHRAD transceiver with improved navigation and detection. Although, the possibility of multiband PHRAD, capable to work in both S-and X-band, becomes feasible that reduces the weight, size and cost of the system. Alternatively, the state-of-the-art electronic techniques have not the required potential to make such radars feasible. The key goal of the proposed project is to develop a PHRAD transceiver tunable over a wide frequency range (\u2265 40GHz) and immune to phase fluctuations in order to realize a robust navigation and detection system capable of providing high imagery-resolution and accuracy.  The proposed work will be carried out in three phases.  In phase I, Mode lock Lasers will be cultivated to generate wide-range and phase-stable radar signals in MMW. These wide-bandwidth signals (40-80GHz) will help to provide high imagery-resolution with accurate speed-computation of objects that lead to a reliable and secure navigation to the autonomous vehicles. In phase II, a multiband PHRAD transceiver will be designed to provide high frequency-flexibility that provides capability to track any frequency signal within S-or X-band. The phase III is dedicated to the implementation of the developed multiband PHRAD in real-time environment, especially in intelligent transport system (ITS), for its testing and evaluation.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

Current wireless trends (cell densification, coordinated communication, massive MIMO) pose a new set of challenges that require the joint consideration of optical and wireless network architectures. These problems are of direct impact to emerging economies such as Brazil, with highly heterogeneous infrastructure capabilities and demand, as well as to more established markets such as the EU, which aims to regain its leadership in the next generation of telecommunication technologies. FUTEBOL establishes the research infrastructure to address these research challenges through innovation over this infrastructure, with a consortium of leading industrial and academic telecommunications institutions. In this capacity, the methodology of the FUTEBOL project is organized into three steps: i) the composition of federated research infrastructure suited for integrated optical\/wireless experimentation, ii) the development of a converged control framework to support experimentation on the federated research infrastructure, and iii) the direct advancement of telecommunications through research using the developed research infrastructure and control framework. The steps of FUTEBOL relate to one another in a layered manner: the end-user driven advancement of telecommunications relies on the development of the FUTEBOL converged control framework, which, in turn, requires the composition of federated research infrastructure. In this way, FUTEBOL directly addresses the agreed priority areas of Brazil and Europe cooperation to guide future innovation in the area of ICT.

Moreover, the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. These facts highlight the need of efficient and environmentally sustainable urban mobility services that do not generate CO2 emissions and ease traffic congestion. \nWithin this context, an innovative service has been developed in order to solve mobility problems in the city of Barcelona and potentially major metropolitan areas in Europe. MOTIT is a unique and innovative electric scooter sharing service, in which users may pick up and drop off vehicles wherever and whenever they want. MOTIT allows users to reserve a scooter with their smartphone, and some minutes before the start of the trip he receives a notification on his smartphone with the position of the vehicle assigned. \nVehicle positioning performance is key for the success of the service, since the user is informed on where to pick up his vehicle based on this source.

Nature routinely creates nanostructured surfaces with fascinating properties, such as antireflective moth eyes, self-cleaning lotus leaves, colourful butterfly wings, and water harvesting desert beetles. Well defined nanostructured surfaces have huge commercial potential due to product enhancement: reduced reflectivity in photonic devices and solar panels, antiglare plastic parts for the automotive industry, hydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces for smart packaging, antireflective and smudge-free smartphone displays, and biofouling resistant marine and water treatment systems. Unfortunately, the lack of cost-effective, scalable, nanopatterning methods is a major hurdle for the commercial exploitation of nanopatterned surfaces. SUN-PILOT will address this challenge by developing a novel and cost effective platform for up-scaling sub-wavelength nanostructures fabrication techniques that can be applied to curved surfaces such as optical lenses, and the mass production of metal moulds for injection moulding of plastic parts. The expected impact of SUN-PILOT for the Optics Industry is a disruptive technology that will boost the performance\/cost ratio of photonic devices by piloting mass fabrication of scratch and wear resistant nanopatterned antireflective optical surfaces. Significant enhancement will be achieved in the efficiency of optical components and systems incorporating these devices, such as laser systems, electronic displays, security cameras and medical devices.

However, this is not going to happen in the initial stages of the introduction of automated driving systems into the market. As a consequence, system and human driver uncertainty pose a significant challenge in the development of trustable and fault-tolerant automated driving controllers, especially for conditional automation (SAE level 3) in mixed traffic scenarios. The TrustVehicle consortium brings together participants from the whole vehicle value chain to enhance safety and user-friendliness of level 3 automated driving systems. The main objectives are: (i) the systematic identification of critical road scenarios based on in-depth analysis of possible traffic situations and human behaviour; (ii) the setup of new tools for the cost- and time-effective assessment of driver-in\/off-the-loop situations; (iii) design of controllers and sensor fusion systems capable of dealing with complex, uncertain and variable road scenarios to enhance road safety; (iv) the implementation of intuitive human-machine interfaces for the safe management of the transition phases taking into account user acceptance and gender-specific aspects; and (iv) the establishment of an adaptive and agile vehicle validation based on self-diagnostics and data logging to steadily extend the list of relevant scenarios and test cases.

This correlation of the audio-visual information has been occasionally explored in literature in order to develop more robust automatic speech recognition systems for cases in which the auditory environment is noisy (e.g. background noise, multiple speakers). However, the problem of audio-visual speech recognition has been mainly studied in controlled, laboratory conditions.

Thus, public 5G networks will not be able to address, in the short term, the promise of novel critical communication services required by vertical users. Private 5G and beyond 5G networks are seen as a promising way to bridge this gap, allowing private venues to deploy the required 5G capabilities early on. Factories and private venues, like stadiums or transportation hubs, are seen as key early adopters of these technologies.\n5G-CLARITY puts forward a beyond 5G architecture for private networks, which features a novel access network integrating 5G, WiFi, and LiFi, compute and transport resources, and novel management components to enable AI driven network automation. Based on this architecture, 5G-CLARITY will define communication services that deliver measurable enhancements with respect to the eMBB and URLLC services defined by 3GPP in Release 16, in terms of low latency, area capacity, reliability, and accurate positioning and synchronization capabilities. In addition, 5G-CLARITY will develop a management plane featuring SDN\/NFV components together with an AI engine that will automate network management by receiving high level intent policies from the network administrator.\n5G-CLARITY brings together an ambitious consortium that ensures the delivery of the project innovations to standard bodies, where 3GPP, O-RAN, IEEE802.11bb, and ETSI-ZSM, have already been identified as preferential targets. Finally, the 5G-CLARITY technology will be demonstrated in two relevant use cases, including a human-robot interaction application in a museum in Bristol, and a network slicing and AGV positioning application for Industry 4.0 services in a factory near Barcelona. Potential for individual and joint exploitation of the project results has already been identified during the proposal preparation phase.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: COREGAL - Combined Positioning-Reflectometry Galileo Code Receiver for Forest Management Abstract: Biomass mapping has gained increased interest for bioenergy, climate research and mitigation activities, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (e.g. REDD initiative).\n\nHowever, continuous deforestation activity and forest management requires frequent and accurate monitoring which can be expensive and difficult to attain. In Brazil, optical satellite data is typically used by government but even such does not allow accurate enough mapping due cloud coverage, requiring combination of other sources such as in-situ and air-borne measurements. Furthermore, satellite radar signals can penetrate clouds but still today the spatial resolution is not sufficient.\n\nIn COREGAL, a low cost unmanned fixed-plane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and service for biomass mapping will allow wide scale mapping in the Brazilian context of forest management. A first of a kind combined Position-Reflectometry Galileo receiver will be developed as main sensor for platform positioning and biomass estimation, the latter using reflected GNSS signals (also called GNSS-R) on tree canopies. High positioning accuracy (centimetre level) is required for surface point reflection determination, which is challenging for remote areas where no GNSS infrastructure is available as in the case of many forests in Brazil. However, Galileo AltBOC E5 signals offer unprecedented pseudorange measurement quality which can be used for novel high accuracy positioning.\n\nThe UAV will be equipped and tested with a COREGAL receiver and optical cameras for aerial mapping and biomass estimation, enabling wide scale low cost mapping: UAV mapping is at least one order of magnitude lower cost than manned air-borne missions while GNSS-R can be seen as bi-static radar replacing expensive, heavy and power consuming radars. \n\nThe consortium includes universities and companies for successful services and technology exploitation.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: RECENT - Ultra-Dense Unsupervised Heterogeneous Wireless Cloud Coded Networks for 5G\/B5G Abstract: \"Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks will undoubtedly have greatly increased density and scale compared to current networks, resulting in massive interaction between nodes. It will be infeasible to provide fixed connections to all access nodes, and hence these networks will evolve towards a heterogeneous, multihop, self-organizing architecture. Moreover, for several significant B5G scenarios (such as vehicular networks in \"\"smart cities\"\") the topology may be a priori unknown and rapidly time-variant: therefore, it will be impractical to provide a global coordinating authority, and hence these networks will be essentially unsupervised. (Security remains paramount, and physical security mechanisms especially appropriate.) The conventional networking paradigm will be severely limited by interference in these scenarios, greatly reducing efficiency. It has already been shown in both theory and practice that wireless physical-layer network coding (WPNC) is nevertheless capable of resolving this situation because it can allow relay nodes to extract useful information from all combined received signals, rather than treating them as deleterious interference. \nHowever, previous work on WPNC [1-5] has not addressed the case of large-scale, unsupervised, secure, dynamic networks. RECENT will address such networks starting with fundamental theory and technology, including information theory, network coded modulation (NCM) for WPNC, stochastic network theory, and physical layer security. The developed technologies will be deployed and validated in the system level simulator and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. Running in parallel to the technical activities, a rigorously crafted innovation management programme will assess business opportunities of RECENT technologies, taking into consideration standards and regulation, and hence ensure that they achieve their full industrial and societal impact.\"","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

QMiCS\u2019 long-term visions are (i) distributed quantum computing & communication via microwave quantum local area networks (QLANs) and (ii) sensing applications based on the illumination of an object with quantum microwaves (quantum radar). With respect to key quantum computing platforms (superconducting circuits, NV centers, quantum dots), microwaves intrinsically allow for zero frequency conversion loss since they are the natural frequency scale. They can be distributed via superconducting cables with surprisingly little losses, eventually allowing for quantum communication and cryptography applications. Radar works at gigahertz frequencies because of the atmospheric transparency windows anyways. Scientifically, QMiCS targets a QLAN demonstration via quantum teleportation, a quantum advantage in microwave illumination, and a roadmap to real-life applications for the second\/third phase of the QT Flagship. Beneath these three grand goals lies a strong component of disruptive enabling technology provided by two full and one external industry partner: the development of a microwave QLAN cable connecting the millikevin stages of two dilution refrigerators, improved cryogenic semiconductor amplifiers, and packaged pre-quantum ultrasensitive microwave detectors. The resulting \"\"enabling\"\" commercial products are beneficial for quantum technologies at microwave frequencies in general.

{"text":"Title: SANSA - Shared Access Terrestrial-Satellite Backhaul Network enabled by Smart Antennas Abstract: The aim of SANSA project is to boost the performance of mobile wireless backhaul networks in terms of capacity and resilience while assuring an efficient use of the spectrum. Recently, a global mobile traffic increase of 11-fold between 2013 and 2018 was predicted, so novel solutions are required to avoid backhaul becoming the bottle neck of future mobile networks.  The solution envisaged in SANSA is a spectrum efficient self-reconfigurable hybrid terrestrial-satellite backhaul network based on three key principles: (i) a seamless integration of the satellite segment into terrestrial backhaul networks; (ii) a terrestrial wireless network capable of reconfiguring its topology according to traffic demands; (iii) a shared spectrum between satellite and terrestrial segments. This combination will result in a flexible solution capable of efficiently routing the mobile traffic in terms of capacity and energy efficiency, while providing resilience against link failures or congestion and easy deployment in rural areas. Therefore, we will develop novel smart antennas, dynamic radio resource management and data-based shared access techniques for enabling the spectrum sharing among both segments, as well as efficient management and routing solutions for the hybrid network. These studies will yield to the implementation and demonstration of the two key components proof of concepts:  (i) low-cost smart antennas (to be deployed in terrestrial nodes) with beam and null-steering capabilities for interference mitigation between satellite and terrestrial transceivers and network topology reconfiguration; (ii) hybrid network manager capable of controlling the resources of the hybrid network.

The game mixes spatial and qualitative approaches, that prompt students to complete certain educational tasks, plan routes , create narratives, or \u201cclaim\u201d certain spots or areas. The app will then feed data created by the students (GPS check-ins, images, texts, recordings) back to a main computer where the findings and activities  are collected, scored with points and evaluated by the teachers of the course. Through this central interface organisers of the course as well as BOTs (automated tasks\/non-playable entities in the game-world) can send messages, advise and tasks  to the participants, information that is also used to share and evaluate the results with students in the classroom. Likewise students can communicate with their supervisors while in the field through this central interface to ask for advise.","gt":true,"conf":0.6}

{"text":"Title: SBS3-5 - Stimulated Brillouin Scattering based RF to Optical Signal Transduction and Amplification Abstract: While the detection of weak signals (down to the single photon level) in the optical frequency range is routine on account of the high photon energy (compared to thermal excitation energy kBT) and the availability of efficient detectors, this is not the case in the radio frequency (RF) and microwave frequency regimes wherein thermal (Johnson) noise in detectors swamps out the faint RF signals (in applications from radio astronomy, MRI to radar) and requires the use of cryogenic amplifiers. The ability to map signals efficiently from the microwave to optical regime becomes paramount for distant systems to communicate with each other using low loss telecom fibers. Both classical (radio over fiber systems) and quantum (linking two superconducting qubit processors in two dilution fridges) information processing systems will benefit greatly from the development of an efficient RF to optical signal transducer.\n I have been developing efficient RF to optical transduction schemes in GaAs cavity optomechanical systems (KC Balram et al., Nature Photonics (2016)) by exploiting its favorable piezoelectric (for coupling RF signals to propagating acoustic waves) and elasto-optic (for engineering strong acousto-optic interactions) properties. In this project, I would like to extend this work and address the issue of weak RF signal detection by up-converting RF signals to the optical domain using integrated Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and shot-noise limited optical detection. Piezoelectric SBS systems can also be used to build high frequency, high gain RF amplifiers with noise figures that can be lower than conventional RF amplifiers. Working in a novel GaAs on insulator platform helps provide some unique advantages (tightly confined acoustic and optical modes with large modal overlap and a large elasto-optic coefficient leading to significant Brillouin gain) while holding the potential for interfacing complex circuitry in a well-established III-V materials platform.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: TCBI - Tracking children in their best interests: electronic monitoring in three European juvenile justice systems Abstract: The implementation of alternatives to deprivation of liberty throughout the juvenile justice procedure has been on the agenda of international children\u2019s rights for about 28 years. The urgent need for alternatives is based on the requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of Child to use measures that deprive children\u2019s liberty as last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. Accordingly, states have to develop suitable alternatives to detaining children for justice purposes. One of the currently popular alternative measures is surveillance of juvenile offenders by using electronic monitoring (EM) devices. EM ensures control through GPS or radio frequency technology, allowing juveniles to remain in or return to the community and maintain their ties with their families and peers. Although these measures seem to be popular among policy makers because of the high level of control, concerns are also raised about their harmful effects, which may be significant in childhood. \nThis research investigates how the application of EM suits the requirements set out by international documents on children\u2019s rights and how national or international policies may be improved towards a better compliance with children\u2019s best interests. The research will be implemented in England and Wales, Hungary and The Netherlands, using a variety of qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (survey) methods to investigate the research questions. The project will generate unique knowledge on multiple aspects of using EM measures in juvenile justice, which will, for the first time, develop understanding at a European level about EM from the perspective of children. It will demonstrate a unique, children\u2019s rights approach and involve different actors of the system, juvenile offenders and children, who will be approached via a number of channels. During the research, special attention will be paid to provide child-friendly and age-sensitive information where necessary.","gt":true,"conf":0.1}

Massive investments on the field and the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensors has moved relevant market uptakes for autonomous driving from 2035 to 2020. \nCAVs are equipped with a huge number of sensors that allow them to understand the environment and act accordingly. However, this technology is superfluous without knowing the location of the vehicle in real time. Technology used to position a mobile device on earth is known as Global Navigation Satellite System \u2013 GNSS (e.g. GPS or GALILEO). Despite it seems impossible, currently, there are not any GNSS solution that meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers for autonomous driving, due to: 1) excessive cost to be implemented at scale (low margin sector) 2) unavailability to provide location updates in real time under hostile GNSS conditions (e.g. urban canyons) and 3) lack of a reliability measure to detect when a location is not accurate enough. \nAt Albora, we have built and patented the Albora Correlation Engine, which uses AI and, in particular, biologically inspired Deep Learning Networks to achieve the performance required by the sector. Moreover, our technology can be embedded on the electronics currently available on autonomous vehicles, allowing us to keep the costs extremely low (no additional HW required!)\nTo exploit our product, we plan to build SW packages of our algorithms and sell licenses through an easy to use API (SW company approach). This model is highly scalable and will allow us to tackle the huge market opportunity. In fact, SW will keep the largest market share for CAV, growing from \u20ac0.5 billion at 2015 to \u20ac25 billion in 2030. To this end, we need to assess the technical risks of migrating our code to more efficient programing languages, seek industrial partners to perform large pilots and fine-tune our business model using design thinking techniques.","gt":true,"conf":0.6}
{"text":"Title: OMICRON - Optical transmission based on integrability and nonlinear Fourier transform Abstract: \"Optical fibre systems form the backbone of global telecommunication networks and carry the bulk of the world's data traffic, serving as a key component of information and communication technology. Although over the years, these systems have become increasingly complex, the quality of optical system performance is still affected by the same key physical features: chromatic dispersion, fiber Kerr nonlinearity, and optical noise. Most of the current optical networks exploit the techniques that were originally developed for linear channels. Thus, it is not surprising that nonlinearity has a detrimental impact on such systems. It has been predicted that, within the next decade the existing optical fibre technology will approach the \"\"nonlinear transmission limit'', which caps the achievable rate of error-free data transmission.  Thus, in order to reach a the higher capacity of optical fibres it is necessary to shift the relevant information and communications technology paradigm by introducing truly nonlinear modulation, transmission, and signal processing techniques. The aim of this project is to develop ground-breaking visionary concepts and approaches to unlock the capacity of fiber-optic communications beyond the limits of current technology by treating optical fiber as the inherently nonlinear medium it is. Our paradigm-shifting approach is based on the concept mathematical notion of integrability and the related nonlinear Fourier transform-type processing of optical signal, which allow us to use of the fibre nonlinearity in a constructive way. This multidisciplinary project, grouping together the mathematical theory of intergability, advanced signal processing, the physics of nonlinear waves evolution, solitons, and noise interaction with nonlinear excitations, combined with the optical transmission methods and purposes, is aimed at the development of fundamentally new communication technologies to satisfy current and future technology challenges.\"","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

{"text":"Title: DAMOSET - With data-driven modelling towards a successful energy transition Abstract: The power grid is an integral part of the power system. It connects all electrical consumers with generators and powers everything from household appliances to large factory machinery. Without this grid, farmers would not be able to feed their animals, car factories would come to a halt, mobile phone systems would fail and many of us would not even be able to make a cup of tea. While the current power system is very reliable and offers a high quality of service, it remains unclear how this will develop in the future. The limited supply of fossil fuels as well as necessary reduction of CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, will eventually lead to a power grid mainly supplied by renewable generators, such as wind and solar plants. These plants output smaller total power so that a large number is necessary which have to be geographically distributed for optimal weather conditions. The current power grid system slowly emerged within several decades of optimization processes. However, now we are discussing how to revolutionize the whole energy system within years. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the current power system is necessary to develop potential pathways to a future 100% sustainable system. In the proposed research, I will use data-driven approaches to work towards a quantitative understanding of fluctuations in the power grid, as they are for example introduced by the changing demand or volatile energy generation. I will analyse the British as well as international grids to understand differences in grid operation and potential solutions for grids.

Both EU and Australian governments are aware of how crucial it is to improve wildfires\u2019 management and containment . Scientists from different specialties, both in EU and Australia, have already developed methods and models in order to  improve the management and decision process  pertaining to preparedness and response phases in case of bushfire. The present project, named Geospatial based Environment for Optimisation Systems Addressing Fire Emergencies (GEO SAFE), aims at  creating a  network enabling the two regions to exchange  knowledge, ideas and experience , thus  boosting the progress of wildfires knowledge  and the related development of innovative methods for dealing efficiently with such fires. \nMore precisely, the GEO SAFE project will focus on developing the tools enabling to set up an integrated decision  support system optimizing the resources  during the response phase, through:\n\u2022 Developing a dynamic risk cartography of a region with regard to the possibility of a wildfire. The task will involve data collection (satellite and remote sensors),  risk analysis and  development  of a tool   enabling to forecast fire extension i, and in particular to predict  fire and risk evolution during the response phase\n\u2022 Designing and testing a resource allocation tool for the response phase using the dynamic risk cartography. One of the problems to consider will be the resource allocation for securing key places (schools, hospitals, \u2026.) given time dependent constraints.

{"text":"Title: MORPHEMIC - Modelling and Orchestrating heterogeneous Resources and Polymorphic applications for Holistic Execution and adaptation of Models In the Cloud Abstract: MORPHEMIC proposes a unique way of adapting and optimizing Cloud computing applications by introducing the novel concepts of polymorph architecture and proactive adaptation. The former is when a component can run in different technical forms, i.e. in a Virtual Machine (VM), in a container, as a big data job, or as serverless components, etc. The technical form of deployment is chosen during the optimization process to fulfil the user\u2019s requirements and needs. The quality of the deployment is measured by a user defined and application specific utility. Depending on the application\u2019s requirements and its current workload, its components could be deployed in various forms in different environments to maximize the utility of the application deployment and the satisfaction of the user. Proactive adaptation is not only based on the current execution context and conditions but aims to forecast future resource needs and possible deployment configurations. This ensures that adaptation can be done effectively and seamlessly for the users of the application. The MORPHEMIC deployment platform will therefore be very beneficial for heterogeneous deployment in distributed environments combining various Cloud levels including Cloud data centres, edge Clouds, 5G base stations, and fog devices. Advanced forecasting methods, including the ES-Hybrid method recently winning the M4 forecasting competition, will be used to achieve the most accurate predictions. The outcome of the project will be implemented in the form of the complete solution, starting from modelling, through profiling, optimization, runtime reconfiguration and monitoring. Then the MORPHEMIC implementation will be integrated as a pre-processor for the existing MELODIC platform extending its deployment and adaptation capabilities beyond the multi-cloud and cross-cloud to the edge, 5G, and fog. This approach allows for a path to early demonstrations and commercial exploitation of the project results.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

This is envisioned by the means of an integrated and virtualised networking and computing solution where virtualised functions, context-aware services, and user and third-party applications are blended together to offer enhanced connectivity and better quality of experience. The proposed solution contemplates two major building blocks, namely (i) the Edge and Fog computing System (EFS) subsuming all the edge and fog computing substrate offered as a shared hosting environment for virtualised functions, services, and applications; and (ii) the Orchestration and Control System (OCS) responsible for managing and controlling the EFS, including its interworking with other (non-EFS) domains (e.g., transport and core networks, distant clouds, etc.).

But MECA asks for more electrical systems, which exchange more data which can be safety critical, and consume more electrical power leading to higher thermal dissipation. This leads to complexity, weight penalty and increased exposure to intended (cybersecurity) and unintended (ElectroMagnetic Compatibility) interference. Overcoming these barriers requires an interdisciplinary cooperation and, in this context, the ADENEAS project emerged, aiming at paving the way for a safe, light, self-configuring, autonomous and modular power and data distribution network that is scalable to all aircraft sizes. To achieve this long-term objective, ADENEAS will define new architecture concepts, develop advanced Artificial Intelligence-based design tools, enabling technologies for intra-aircraft data communication and for power network and a cooling system. The project will also demonstrate the integration of the data and power network and cooling system, initiate standardisation activities and ensure commercial viability.\nTo achieve these objectives, ADENEAS will start from solid foundation of partner\u2019s background, previous and ongoing R&D activities and will implement a stepwise approach from the definition of requirements and reference case (for small, medium and large aircraft) up to the assessment and evaluation of the developed, tested and demonstrated technologies.

{"text":"Title: CORRELATION - Characterization and prediction of service-level traffic for future sliced mobile network Abstract: Network slicing is a key enabling technology for the 5th generation (5G) and beyond mobile networks. Network slicing allows the creation of multiple logical network instances on the same underlying physical network. Slices can then be formed or combined on-demand, with parameters optimized according to various service requirements so as to meet the users\u2019 instant requests for specific mobile services. Hence, the performance of network slicing heavily depends on characterizing and predicting the spatial- temporal traffic patterns for individual services in near real-time. \n\nResearch on characterization and prediction for service-level mobile traffic is still in nascence. Firstly, the traffic characteristics and predicting methods of individual services, especially the 5G services, have not been studied adequately. Secondly, traffic correlation among different services and the reasons behind it have not been well studied. Thirdly, inter-service correlations have not been well exploited in service-level mobile traffic prediction. \n\nIn this project, we will address these gaps. Firstly, we will study the spatial-temporal characteristics of service-level traffic patterns at multi-scales, based on which, we will investigate the traffic predicting frameworks for individual services. Secondly, for the first time, we will investigate the traffic correlation among different services and try to discover the underlying reasons by analyzing the service usage profiles of different user groups. Finally, based on inter-service correlations, we will investigate whether we can improve service-level traffic prediction accuracy and whether we could execute prediction for diverse services according to the historical records of only a few key services.\n\nThe success of the CORRELATION project will make proactive network slicing possible, which will then drive proactive network optimisation for 5G and beyond mobile networks.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

At present different techniques are needed to inspect the ballast, track substructure and tunnels. TRACKSCAN would undertake these activities and more through non-invasive inspection. Within Europe ballast inspection requires digging a trench or driving plastic lined steel tubes into ballast with a pneumatic hammer.

{"text":"Title: FreeATPOC - Towards an instrument-free future of molecular diagnostics at the point-of-care Abstract: Molecular diagnostics is still primarily a lab-based method. Emerging technologies for application at the point of care (POC) or need, i.e., where a patient or a sample is, have started gaining a big part of the molecular diagnostics market. Interestingly, available methods are divided in two groups: sophisticated instruments for ultra-sensitive temperature-regulated enzymatic amplification of nucleic acids and extremely simple paper-based immuno-diagnostic kits. Complexity, the main disadvantage of the former, results in their poor translation to several applications at the POC. Simplicity, often accompanied by failures, of the latter is the reason for their slow adoption even in resource limited areas. Our vision is an instrument-free approach that combines the advantages of both groups, i.e., a method that does not use heaters or modules that require electricity, infrastructure and maintenance, but, still, takes advantage of enzymatically-amplified nucleic acids detection. To achieve the above, novel diagnostic tools for genetic amplification based on ligases, polymerases and restriction enzymes operating at ambient temperature will be developed, combined with quantitative smartphone colorimetric\/UV detection. The global applicability of the new approach will be demonstrated during infectious disease (Influenza and HIV) testing in human samples (blood and swabs) and plant pathogens (Xylella fastidiosa) in plant-tissues. In all cases, we aim for a time-to-result of less than 60 min, demonstrated sensitivities down to the clinically\/field relevant values and a final cost in the order of $1 per assay. Combination of Free@POC concept with newly developed predictive models will expand its utility to monitoring disease outbreaks and their spreading.

{"text":"Title: DEEPVOLC - Forecasting volcanic activity using deep learning Abstract: DEEPVOLC will radically advance the way future activity is forecast at volcanoes by applying advances in artificial intelligence to transformative new geodetic datasets. 200 million people live within 30 km of a volcano. Accurate forecasting of volcanic eruptions is problematic because 1) it relies on human interpretation at individual volcanoes, 2) a volcano can behave in unexpected ways not previously seen at that location, and 3) most volcanoes are not instrumented. DEEPVOLC will address this by i) applying artificial intelligence, ii) using data for all volcanoes worldwide, and iii) exploiting advances in satellite monitoring. A key indicator of potential volcanic activity is deformation of a volcano's surface due to magma migrating beneath. Surface movements as small as a few millimetres can now be measured from space, using satellite-borne radar. A recently-launched European satellite mission, Sentinel-1, has transformed our ability to measure surface deformation at all of the world's volcanoes, acquiring data at least twice every twelve days. However, forecasting how deforming volcanoes will behave in the future remains challenging. In this project I will apply recently developed deep learning approaches to the satellite data. This is an entirely new approach to forecasting volcanic activity, which currently relies on the individual expertise available at each observatory, and which is only now made possible due to the launch of Sentinel-1 and advances in deep learning algorithms. DEEPVOLC will combine knowledge from all volcanoes that have been active in the era of satellite deformation observations, and will continue to improve as it ingests data from new activity. The main deliverable will be a system for volcano observatories that uses knowledge of how volcanoes behave globally to automatically identify deformation at volcanoes locally, and forecast how the deformation will evolve, indicating the probability of eruption.","gt":true,"conf":0.0}

Service providers and researchers worldwide are sparing no effort to increase the information capacity and security of telecommunication networks to support the demands of high-speed, reliable and secure emerging internet, data centre, cloud computing, 5G new radio and IoT systems, especially since the outbreak of Coronavirus. Applications such as intelligent transportation, signal processing ubiquitous low-latency connectivity and massive connected objects, have raised challenges for backbone and access networks that are often underpinned by optical, radio or hybrid networks. Artificial intelligent (AI) technologies appear an innovative and promising solution to cope with emerging challenges in optical\/wireless\/hybrid networks, in which the underlying physics, mathematics and optimisation of problems are non-deterministic to analyse or impossible to describe explicitly. In this proposed research, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques such as neural networks, clustering and regression will be exploited in optical\/wireless\/hybrid networks to mitigate stochastic distortions, to predict network conditions and to maximise network capacity.

{"text":"Title: selfBACK - A decision support system for self-management of low back pain Abstract: The recent global burden of disease study showed that low back pain (LBP) is the most significant contributor to disability in Europe. Most patients seen in primary care with LBP have non-specific LBP (\u226585%), i.e., pain that cannot reliably be attributed to a specific disease\/pathology. LBP is the fourth most common diagnosis seen in primary care (after upper respiratory infection, hypertension, and coughing). Self-management in the form of physical activity and strength\/stretching exercises constitutes the core component in the management of non-specific LBP; however, adherence to self-management challenging due to lack of feedback and reinforcement. This project aims to develop a decision support system - SELFBACK - that will be used by the patient him\/herself to facilitate, improve and reinforce self-management of LBP. Specifically, SELFBACK will be designed to assist the patient in deciding and reinforcing the appropriate actions to manage own LBP after consulting a health care professional in primary care. The decision support will be conveyed to the patient via a smartphone app in the form of advice for self-management. The advice will be tailored to each patient based on the symptom state, symptom progression, the patients goal-setting, and a range of patient characteristics including information from a physical activity-detecting wristband worn by the patient. The second part of the project will evaluate the effectiveness of SELFBACK in a randomized controlled trial using pain-related disability as primary outcome. We envisage that patients who use SELFBACK will have 20% reduction in pain-related disability at 9 months follow-up compared to patients receiving treatment as usual. Process evaluation will be carried out as an integrated part of the trial to document the implementation and map the patients\u2019 satisfaction with SELFBACK. A business plan with a targeted commercialisation strategy will be developed to transfer the SELFBACK technology into the market.","gt":true,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: SENTRY - Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Cable Monitoring and Surveying for Offshore Wind Farms providing movement, depth, surface disruption and free-span readings Abstract: Electricity Distribution Services Ltd (EDS) is a global leader in High Voltage (HV) asset management for offshore wind farms.  In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than \u20ac60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector. The financial severity of these incidents continues to grow \u2013 such that they account for 77% of the total global cost of offshore wind farm losses. Our CableSENTRY is an innovative solution based on Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that detects subsea cable faults in real time. Acoustic signals from the HV cable create an optical response in a fibre optic line so faults and other events can be located accurately and immediately on a calibrated system. Applied in addition to existing fault location technology, our solution will be able to identify fault locations in land and subsea HV cables and save an average of 4 days\u2019 downtime per fault over current methods","gt":true,"conf":0.8}

Nevertheless, even nowadays, the medical practice still lacks of systems providing a rapid, reliable and ultra-sensitive sensing in a continuous way. Meanwhile, inflammatory markers consist a pivotal tool in clinical practice since they may be indicators of specific diseases, along with signalising the response of a patient to a specific medical treatment. Nanotechnology-based devices exhibiting memristive electrical properties show great potential for delivering highly scalable, resilient, power efficient and reconfigurable electronic systems. In addition, when those particular nanodevices are subjected to appropriate surface treatments and implemented in the role of bio-inspired sensors, they can bring solutions and introduce novelty to the bio-sensing field regarding highly sensitive and robust detection of biomarkers, while expanding and broadening the research field and applications involving memristive phenomena. In the framework of this fellowship, a flexible, low-cost miniaturised minimally invasive sensing platform will be developed, implementing memristive nanoscale devices as intelligent bio-interfaces, allowing reliable, continuous and real-time monitoring of inflammatory markers. This scheme will be accomplished by the fabrication of a memristor-based sensing platform conjugated with a sensing membrane and an accordingly designed binding assay. Validation of the sensing platform for continuous monitoring will be followed by the integration on flexible substrates for in vivo measurements and integration with readout circuitry enabling the sensing data readout and the wireless transmission to a tablet or smartphone.

For example, the city of Rome\u2019s 3million inhabitants are serviced by 65,000km of buried pipes and cables. Due to this congestion, delivery of vital utilities through the installation and maintenance of new and existing underground services is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous.

{"text":"Title: D4FLY - Detecting Document frauD and iDentity on the fly Abstract: The D4FLY project will augment the current capabilities and capacities of border authorities in countering emerging threats in document and identity verification (e.g., forged documents, impostor fraud, morphed faces) at manual and highly automated border control points and in the issuance process of genuine documents. The confluence of D4FLY set of tools and systems will improve the quality of verification and reduce major time sinks in the processes thus enabling real on-the-move border crossing experience for travelers. Novel sensor hardware based on advanced lightfield cameras and novel algorithms developed in the project will enhance verification accuracy and robustness via the combined usage of 2D+thermal face, 3D face, iris and somatotype biometrics. Analytical means to identify known criminals based on somatotype and 3D face data generated from mugshots and observation data will be developed. Various operational needs of end-users with different threat landscapes constitute the backbone of D4FLY development efforts. D4FLY will create a resilient document verification system that can verify a multitude of physical and electronic security features (e.g. Kinegrams\u00ae, MLIs, CLIs), detect complex forms of electronic fraud and advanced morphing, and identify fraud in breeder documents. The potential benefit of blockchain technology in identity verification will also be investigated. The D4FLY solution will consist of a border control kiosk geared with enhanced enrolment, verification and detection capabilities; smartphones applications for improved performance and verification capabilities; and a non-stop on-the-move system for biometric verification. The innovation will be validated against European societal values, fundamental rights, privacy, data protection and applicable legislation.

It will tackle the problem of reducing air pollution at target receptors with an innovative SME-led approach, focusing on the use of \u201cPassive Control Systems\u201d in urban spaces. Improvements in air quality, microclimate and behavioural aspects of urban dwellers will be achieved by applying real-world physical interventions on the urban tissue to alter ventilation rates and dispersion patterns in the selected cities assessed for future climate change scenarios and representative of different cultural&life styles in Europe. Through the approach of Living Labs the team will deploy a network of air quality and meteorological sensors (both stationary and mobile) and evaluate through analysis and a suite of up-to-date numerical modelling the benefits expected from the interventions on a neighbourhood and city-wide scale for several aspects ranging from quantification of pollutant concentration to exposure. iSCAPE encapsulates the concept of \u201csmart cities\u201d by promoting the use of low-cost sensors, engaging citizens in the use of alternative solution processes to environmental problems. iSCAPE will support sustainable urban development by promoting the sharing of results with policy-makers and planners using local test-cases, and providing scientific evidence ready-to-use solutions potentially leading to real-time operational interventions. This integrated approach will include the development and assessment of a framework aimed at changing the mobility behaviour of people by studying processes and dynamics that lead to more resilient, healthy, and sustainable cities, by bringing together theory from urban planning, public policy, urban and environmental sociology and urban geography.","gt":true,"conf":0.1}

This trend is set to continue, as Europe further considers visa liberalization agreements in a bid to sustain their competitive stance in the global tourism market. This will create major implications on the security and border management in the EU, as well as diminishing the Quality of Experience for passenger travel.  \nExisting directives for controlling border crossing is to conduct checks using biometric data in conjunction with VIS (Visa Information Systems), as specified in the Schengen Border Code. However, current biometric systems rely on one mode of biometric data, that can at times can lead to false identification, in particular under uncontrolled conditions during live sample acquisition. Moreover, the current crop of scanning devices are limited in coverage and typically have fixed links, thus confining the range of border control applications and compromising the comfort of passengers. We aim to go beyond and propose an innovative passenger-centric biometric system that authenticates \u201con the fly\u201d. We combine the scientific field of wireless security, biometric recognition and data fusion to develop a  secure and wireless multimodal biometric scanning device for passenger verification targeting land and sea border control applications. \nThe research approach is the basis for a RISE training action that we refer to as eBORDER, that is foreseen to enhance both the career potential of staff members and innovation capacity at the institutional level.

The production process, often the products, the supply chains, and the communication with end users.\nThe digital world calls for fast and cross-border re-use of creative content in different contexts, at different levels of granularity, for different purposes.\nHowever there is a dark lacuna when it comes to the digital content value network \u2013 everything is digital except the actual functioning of the rights supply chains to enable such re-use. When users wish to re-use content, it is very hard to find information on who to ask for permission, which licenses are available, and on which terms and conditions.\nThis is where the ARDITO project comes into play. The project vision is that any user should be able easily to access such rights information. To obtain this, we need a Rights Data Network (RDN), a network of connected e-infrastructures to automate the exchange of information about rights. We do not start from scratch. The Linked Content Coalition initiative has defined the framework. The RDI project has demonstrated how such RDN could implement the LCC framework; and the Copyright Hub has provided a first implementation of such principles.\nThe time to go live with actual services is now. A group of SMEs, well established in different creative sectors (books, audio-visual and images), a research centre and the Copyright Hub Foundation decided to promote the ARDITO idea to accelerate the development of the RDN, through optimising a range of content identification technologies (watermarks, content recognition, DOIs) for use in the RDN, integrating them into the Copyright Hub ecosystem, and developing new services, ready to bring to the market.\nThe services are varied but share the same vision: to be an access point to the RDN offered to different markets.

A key advance would be to understand the transition in Earth\u2019s climate response to changes in orbital forcing during the 'mid-Pleistocene transition' (900 to 1200 thousand years ago) and in particular the role of greenhouse gases. Unravelling such key linkages between the carbon cycle, ice sheets, atmosphere and ocean behaviour is vital for society to better design effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Only ice cores contain the unique and quantitative information about past climate forcing and atmospheric responses. But the ice providing essential evidence about past mechanisms of climate change more than 1 Ma ago required for our understanding of these changes (termed the \u201cOldest Ice\u201d core), has not been found to date.\nThe consortium BEYOND EPICA \u2013 OLDEST ICE (BE-OI), formed by 14 European institutions, takes on this challenge to prepare the ground for obtaining 1.5 million year old ice from East Antarctica.

{"text":"Title: SCOPE - Surface-COnfined fast-modulated Plasma for process and Energy intensification in small molecules conversion Abstract: The SCOPE project will introduce a ground-breaking approach to use renewable energy in three major industrial reactions: 1) N2 fixation, 2) CH4 valorization and 3) CO2 conversion to liquid solar fuels. We will use non-thermal plasma, which has large potential to convert these small (low reactive) molecules under near ambient temperature and pressure, particularly for distributed processes based on renewable energy. The new processes have drastically lower carbon footprint (up to over 90% with respect to current ones). Furthermore, CO2 conversion is crucial for a world-based distribution of renewable energy. However, the selectivity and energy efficiency of plasma technologies for these reactions are too low, making radically new approaches necessary. \n\nThe Project idea is to realize a highly innovative approach for non-thermal plasma symbiosis with catalysis. By inducing excited states in solid catalysts to work in synergy with the excited short-lived plasma species, we introduce a brand new idea for catalyst-plasma symbiosis. In addition, we introduce a fully new concept of nano-\/micro-plasma array through a novel electrode design, to generate the plasma at the catalyst surface, thereby overcoming long distance transport. By embedding ferro-magnetic nano-domains in the catalyst support and inducing radiofrequency heating, we create fast temperature modulations directly at the catalyst active sites. Combining these elements, the project will overcome the actual limits and enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency to levels suitable for exploitation. This requires a synergy over different scale elements: nano at catalyst, micro at the level of modelling plasma generated species, milli at the reactor scale and mega at the plant level for sustainability-driven opportunity guidance and impact assessment by Life-Cycle-Assessment. The synergy value derives from the integration of the PI competencies over this entire dimensional-scale level.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: iMETland - iMETland: A new generation of Microbial Electrochemical Wetland for effective decentralized wastewater treatment Abstract: iMETland project aims to construct and validate a full-scale application of a eco-friendly device to treat urban wastewater from small communities at zero-energy operation cost. Our concept comes from the integration of Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (MET) with the biofilters used in constructed wetlands. iMETland outperforms classical biofilters from constructed wetlands by using electroactive bacteria in combination with a innovative electroconductive material to achive depuration rates that are 10-fold higher than classical techniques. On top of that, the low biomass yield generated under electrogenic conditions avoids any bed colmatation. Wastewater will be also converted into pathogen-free water suitable for irrigation by using an electro-oxidative methodology. Furthermore, the unique conversion of sewage treatment into electric current by electricity-producing bacteria makes such a process an internal reporter of the biological depuration process. So thus, it can be used as output signal to control the process and can easily inform the operator through ICT tools, converting the depuration in an interactive process between device and a smart-phone in end-user\u00b4s hands.\niMETland try to fill the gap that was sharply identified by the programme topic: WATER-1-2014\/2015: Bridging the gap: from innovative water solutions to market replication.

The aim is to combine an intellectual challenge in understanding the contemporary nature of age and the impact of new media, with an applied challenge to use this knowledge to help make mHealth a more effective intervention. \nThrough simultaneous 15 month ethnographies in China, Japan, Iran, Ireland, Nigeria and Tanzania (and supplementary work in Trinidad) a team will explore the experience of age for those between 45-70 i.e. neither clearly young nor elderly, who represent an unprecedented population that has resulted from changed life expectancy and changed aspirations. We will examine how this shift in the experience of age is impacted by the rise of smartphones that bring access to technologies associated with the young. mHealth started with youth orientated issues of fitness and wellbeing but is increasingly becoming a significant intervention in helping older populations deal with disease and frailties. mHealth has potential both for helping those with low access to professional care but also threatens to bypass and undermine professional medical services. Our aim is to complement technology led mHealth interventions with ethnography led participatory design, consisting of a collaboration between mHealth professionals with our ethnographically informed team and our informants.\nThe applied anthropology will inform our intellectual advances in the field of digital anthropology. Reflections on mHealth will contribute to the core aim of advancing our understanding of the experience of age in this new interstitial period of life, and to appreciate the major transformations in society and sociality represented by the new ubiquity of the smartphone.

The majority of these uncovered populations are low income and live in rural regions of Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Current solutions for communication service in rural areas are based on large communication satellites (3,000 kg), leading to lengthy and costly development, as well as high costs of production, launch and operation. The central challenge in reaching uncovered communities is overcoming the unfavorable cost- benefit equation related to installing an operative communication infrastructure (with launch, maintenance and operating costs), whilst providing reliable and affordable communication. \nWith a sophisticated and revolutionary telecommunication network infrastructure leveraging nanosatellite technology, the Pearls constellation of 200 nano-satellites will provide affordable and reliable communication services anywhere within the Equatorial band. An advanced space technology, combined with a complex software infrastructure, provides a robust satellite communication platform that can be accessed at a low price and from any commercial cell phone.

Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM.

AdMiRe is focused on sectors where the lead industry partners in the consortium are key players, thus guaranteeing the impact of the innovation and the take up of the technology. \nAt present, TV audiences can interact with the shows they are watching only through social media or HBBTV. Comments, video and audio from the audience may be incorporated into TV program formats, but this is done in such a way that viewer engagement is quite limited and there is not much potential for innovation. AdMiRe will radically change this by producing solutions that will allow viewers at home to be incorporated into the live TV program they are watching and to interact with people in the TV studio. The key innovation here is to use a regular mobile phone to capture the viewer, extract him\/her from the background and finally composite the viewer into the studio footage as an MR object. \nAs for content creators, be it in film, TV or live productions, there is an ever growing trend to combine actors and performers with computer generated objects and have them interact. But the number and difficulty of the technical challenges involved have resulted in methods and technologies of reduced scope, resulting in less engaging content. AdMiRe takes the exact opposite approach, producing authoring tools that remove the main technological obstacles and that will allow actors to be immersed in virtual environments, performers to feel at home within the space, and directors to have the opportunity to better capture emotion, all in all resulting in the possibility to create more compelling visuals and more engaging programming.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

The current analysis\/synthesis methods that provide a statistical characterization exhibit however a lack of perceived quality. This issue does not pose a problem in applications designed for noisy environments (e.g. navigation devices, smart-phone applications, announcements in train stations). On the contrary, it prohibits the use of statistical approaches in quiet environments, e.g. in the music, cinema and video game industries, where the listener is fully aware of all the details of the sound. This problem is mainly due to the lack of an accurate representation of the phase information and its correlation with the amplitude information. Indeed, recent phase processing tools allowed the description of the phase spectrum properties in a way that shows the drawbacks and limits of current analysis\/synthesis methods. Additionally, these same tools are also promising means for modeling the phase information, which is paramount for good quality. The primary goal of the HQSTS project is to create a high-quality analysis\/synthesis method that will broaden the applications of statistical approaches of speech technologies in quiet environments, where a high-quality is an absolute necessity.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}
{"text":"Title: FoodSMART - Shaping Smarter Consumer Behaviour and Food Choice Abstract: Compared to meals prepared at home, meals eaten out tend to contain more calories, total fat and saturated fat and it is here where the consumer has very little control or knowledge of the nutrient profile of the food they are eating (Bohm and Quartuccio, 2008). The positive association between the rise in consumption of food prepared outside the home and the increasing prevalence of obesity has been described as a major health and wellbeing societal challenge. Attempts to increase public awareness of appropriate ways to eat more healthily unfortunately do not seem to have led to significant changes in patterns of food purchase and consumption especially from an eating \u2018out-of-home\u2019 situation. It has become obvious that the development of effective measures for improvement requires further systematic research and a radical approach. The aim of FoodSMART is to develop an innovative technical (ICT) menu solution that enables informed consumer choice when eating out that takes into account individual characteristics (such as culture, dietary requirements and age group) as well as product (specification) and environmental cues (choice architecture and consumption setting). \nThis aim will be achieved through the evaluation of consumer orientated intelligence (what information consumers require\/trust i.e. information quality); the assessment of industry orientated intelligence (impact of customisation) and the subsequent development of data analytics and Quick Recognition (QR) coding for personalised food recommendation; thereby, facilitating the consumption of healthy and appropriate dishes. Results will be gathered and modelled to provide strategic intelligence for menu design and decision-making (by Industry) and for policy purposes (by the EU); further, this translational research will be disseminated both at scientific and consumer levels. Increasing the pace and scale of innovation within out-of-home eating is fundamental to this proposal.","gt":true,"conf":0.0}

Most of these devices use Wi-Fi Access Points (AP) where possible, in addition to 3G\/4G, to connect to the Internet due to its speed, maturity and efficiency. \n\nGiven this demand, Wi-Fi is facing mounting issues of spectrum efficiency due to its utilisation of non-licensed frequency bands, so improvements continue to be added to standards in order to improve performance and adapt it to new demands. For example, as Wi-Fi saturation increases in areas, such as business centres, malls, campuses or even whole European cities, interference between these competing APs can begin to negatively impact users\u2019 experience. At the same time, real-time interactive services have grown in popularity and are now used across a range of mobile devices. These share the same connection with \u201ctraditional\u201d applications, such as e-mail and Web browsing, but are far more bandwidth intensive and require consistent network capacity to meet user Quality of Experience demands. \n\nIn this context, Wi-5 Project (What to do With the Wi-Fi Wild West) proposes an architecture based on an integrated and coordinated set of smart solutions able to efficiently reduce interference between neighbouring APs and provide optimised connectivity for new and emerging services.

The system can generate search queries and return the information requested by interacting with humans through virtual characters. These virtual humans will be able to sustain an interaction with a user for some time, and react appropriately to the user's verbal and non-verbal behaviour when presenting the requested information and refining search results. Using audio and video signals as input, both verbal and non-verbal components of human communication are captured. Together with a rich and realistic emotive personality model, a sophisticated dialogue management system decides how to respond to a user's input, be it a spoken sentence, a head nod, or a smile. The ARIA uses special speech synthesisers to create emotionally coloured speech and a fully expressive 3D face to create the chosen response. Back-channelling, indicating that the ARIA understood what the user meant, or returning a smile are but a few of the many ways in which it can employ emotionally coloured social signals to improve communication.  \nAs part of the project, the consortium will develop two specific implementations of ARIAs for two different industrial applications.

However, they do not provide support for early mood assessment or psychological treatment and lack a real-time comprehensive assessment of the patient\u2019s mental status. \nDepression is the third leading contributor to global diseases, and depressive mood state is also considered to be strictly related to the onset or worsening of a severe primary somatic disease. Indeed effective preventive medicine related to the onset of depressive symptoms as a comorbidity and worsening factor of psychosomatic diseases such as myocardial infarction, leg-amputation, cancer, and kidney failure is lacking. \nNEVERMIND sets out to empower people who suffer from symptoms of depression related to a serious somatic disease by placing them at the center of their mental healthcare. Equipped with just a smartphone and a lightweight sensitized shirt, patients seeking care and treatment for their mental illnesses interact with these devices that collect data about their mental and physical health, to then get effective feedback.

{"text":"Title: FORMOBILE - From mobile phones to court \u2013 A complete FORensic investigation chain targeting MOBILE devices Abstract: Mobile devices, especially smartphones represent a unique challenge for law enforcement. Criminal offenders use phones to communicate, coordinate, organise and execute criminal actions. This is especially true for organised crime and terrorist organisations. This development provides new challenges for criminal prosecution and it is vital to empower law enforcement to access the data stored on mobile devices to use it as court evidence in a trustworthy and reliable manner.  The overarching objective of FORMOBILE is to establish a complete end to end forensic investigation chain, targeting for mobile devices. To achieve this goal three objectives will be pursued. Novel tools shall be developed that include the acquisition of previously unavailable mobile data, unlocking mobile devices, as well as the decoding and analysis of mobile data. Based on the definition of requirements of law enforcement and legal and ethical issues a new mobile forensics standard shall be developed. With the developments of the new standard and the new tools, training for police and criminal prosecution will be established, providing the end users with the latest knowledge in a novel and an innovative curriculum to ensure a quality standard of investigations.   The European Union has developed as a Security Union, building on the European Agenda on Security. This aims to ensure that people live in an area of freedom, security and justice, without internal frontiers. To strengthen digital forensics in the context of criminal investigations is crucial to achieve this vision. FORMOBILE contributes to the fight against virtually all forms of crime. This is because mobile devices are widely used in crimes, especially in the arrangement of conspiracies.

Optical networks underwent considerable changes over the past decade, as consequence of a continuous growth (exceeding 20% per year) of bandwidth demand.   The current growth sets strong requirements in terms of capacity and costs for the operators, which seek to decrease the cost per transmitted bit. Several solutions have been proposed, and among them wide-band is more favourable to network operators, compared to more\/or novel fibers. However, wide-band optical system presents new major challenges: optical components must guarantee similar performance over a broad spectrum, network optimization is carried out on a non-flat spectrum and with a much larger number of channels making design, optimization and control a complex problem. Therefore, application of machine learning (ML) techniques is of the growing importance for high-capacity multi-band (MB) optical systems.

Indeed, the current IoT landscape consists of a large set of isolated islands that do not constitute a real internet, preventing the exploitation of the huge potential expected by ICT visionaries.\n\nTo overcome this situation, VICINITY presents a virtual neighborhood concept, which is a decentralized, bottom-up and cross-domain approach that resembles a social network, where users can configure their set ups, integrate standards according to the services they want to use and fully control their desired level of privacy. VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services.\n\nVICINITY's approach will be demonstrated by a large-scale demonstration connecting 8 facilities in 7 different countries. The demonstration covers various domains including energy, building automation, health and transport. VICINITY's potential to create new, domain-crossing services will be demonstrated by value added services such as micro-trading of DSM capabilities, AI-driven optimization of smart urban districts and business intelligence over IoT.\n\nOpen calls are envisioned in the project to integrate further, preferably public, IoT infrastructures and to deploy additional added value services.

It is  proposed to last 48 months to implement, as the call requests, a very ambitious restructuring of the backbone network operated by G\u00c9ANT in order to provide equal access to clouds and other e-infrastructure services in the European research area and beyond.  It will improve the overall resilience and reliability of the G\u00c9ANT network significantly and offer a base for future improvements in access, transmission speeds and capacity wherever needed.\nThe outcome of GN4-3N project will offer uniform network access and choice of services to many more partners, eliminating the \"\"digital divide\"\" wherever technically and economically feasible. \nThis project proposal is based on technical and economic studies carried out during 2017-2018 in the GN4-2 project which have given the Consortium clarity on the resourcing, financial and effort, needed to realise the huge ambition of this undertaking.  It exclusively covers the engineering, procurement, acquisition and installation of the new backbone network. The day-to-day network operations as the elements of it is commissioned is the responsibility of the teams described in accompanying the GN4-3 project.\nThe GN4-3 and GN4-3N proposals are intimately connected through common teams and the technical, management and procurement expertise built-up over previous GN projects. This is what makes this ambitious proposal realistic.

{"text":"Title: SMARTRange - A disruptive wireless transceiver chip to transform the Internet of Things (IoT) by delivering excellent range, ultra-low power, high security, high reliability and cost-effective connectivity. Abstract: Part of the 4th Industrial Revolution, the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a global growth opportunity. In particular, the IoT offers tremendous socio-economic and environmental benefits through the improved automation and energy efficiency of Smart Homes, Buildings and Industrial Plants.\n\nMost IoT applications demand that devices provide the range of WiFi. In addition, devices must be standards-based, highly secure, globally interoperable, reliable, ultra-low power and cost effective.\n\nHowever, existing IoT technology is failing to meet these market needs. Current 2.4GHz radios have limited range and sub-GHz radios do not give security or global interoperability. \n\nThere are two ways to increase the range of radio devices: 1) increase transmit power or 2) improve the radio\u2019s receiver sensitivity (Rx sensitivity). However, legislation in Europe limits transmit power to 10dBm, meaning the only practical way to increase range is to improve Rx sensitivity. \n\nCascoda has developed a disruptive 2.4GHz wireless transceiver based on a unique patent-protected radio architecture, which significantly improves Rx sensitivity, effectively doubling the range without using any external power amplifiers. This delivers the range of WiFi to provide whole-house coverage, reduces power consumption by a factor of 6 enabling years of operation from batteries, provides high security, reliability and reduces equipment costs by a factor 5 as no power amplifiers are needed. \n\nExtensive R&D and market feasibility studies including a Eureka Eurostars and a H2020 Phase 1 project, have taken us this far. This Phase 2 project will allow us to optimise, refine and certify our products under industry standards and demonstrate our systems under real-world conditions. This project enables us to enter the low-power wireless market worth at least \u20ac3 billion. By 2025, we will cumulatively generate \u20ac48 million in revenues and \u20ac27 million in operating profits and help create up to 184 skilled jobs.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

They will be able to overcome the information bottleneck due to wired connections and will lead the semiconductor industry into a new More-Than-Moore era. Designing the architecture of these wireless C2C networks is, however, impossible today based on standard engineering design tools. Efficient modelling strategies for describing noisy electromagnetic fields in complex environments are necessary for developing these new chip architectures and wireless interconnectors. Device modelling and chip optimization procedures need to be based on the underlying physics for determining the electromagnetic fields, the noise models and complex interference pattern. In addition, they need to take into account input signals of modern communication systems being modulated, coded, noisy and eventually disturbed by other signals and thus extremely complex. \nRecent advances both in electrical engineering and mathematical physics make it possible to deliver the breakthroughs necessary to enable this future emerging wireless C2C technology by creating a revolutionary electromagnetic field simulation toolbox. Increasingly sophisticated physical models of wireless interconnects and associated signal processing strategies and new insight into wave modelling in complex environments based on dynamical systems theory and random matrix theory make it possible to envisage wireless communication on a chip level.

The focus is on civil robots supporting fire brigades in search and rescue missions, e.g. in post-disaster management operations in response to tunnel fires. Existing sensor technology and the related cognitive approaches cannot cope with such demanding conditions. SmokeBot addresses this shortcoming and can thus bring about a step change for robotics. It will deliver software and hardware components which facilitate robot systems to perform under harsh conditions of smoke, dust or fog. This will be demonstrated through integration of the project results in an industrial prototype of a Low Visibility Explorer Robot for providing situational awareness based on a commercial platform from partner TAUR. In close collaboration with TAUR (robotics industry) and end users (FDDO, end users in the advisory group), SmokeBot will crucially improve the abilities of the selected platform, thus increasing safety of rescue staff and European citizens as well as improving the product of a European robotics company in an important market.

{"text":"Title: OHPF - Optimizing for Happiness in Personal Finance Abstract: In this project, we will (1) investigate the ability to use the log of emotional states captured with wearable trackers for improving affective forecasting abilities of people, (2) build a tool for managing personal finance that integrates prediction analytics, and (3) evaluate if accurate expectations about purchases increase happiness of individuals. \n\nHappiness and wealth are important metrics in our society with no simple relationship between them. One explanation for why money does not buy happiness is that individuals often have imprecise expectations about things they buy: imprecise forecasting of the nature, intensity and duration of an affective response derived from a purchase. Current technology enables people to track how money is spent to help take control of one\u2019s personal finance, balancing income and expenses, and achieving financial goals. A similar trend is present in tracking of emotional well-being of people through novel wearable sensors emerging from the Quantified Self movement. This project harnesses these unique and timely developments in improving the positive impact wealth can have on happiness. We will improve the accuracy of affective forecasts about future purchases by keeping history of emotional states and associated spending, performing prediction analytics based on the collected data, and providing feedback about anticipated affective value of the purchases. Such a feedback is expected to remedy the biases in affective forecasting that people are prone to and can be integrated into the tools for managing personal finance.","gt":true,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: COIN - Coding for Optical communications In the Nonlinear regime Abstract: The rapid increase in data traffic in the past years and traffic forecasts will lead to capacity exhaust in the optical fibre communications infrastructure which carries over 95% of all data services. The optical fibre channel is nonlinear, that is, its properties, namely its refractive index, is dependent on optical intensity, and at high power densities, the combination of nonlinear effects and dispersion leads to nonlinear distortion, limiting both achievable capacities, spectral efficiencies and distances. A key research area requiring investigation is nonlinear coding and detection, tailored to the nonlinear channel to dramatically improve the data throughput of future optical networks. New R&D is critically needed not only for finding new native nonlinear communication techniques but also transferring them into practical, error-resilient systems. The COIN objective is, thus, the development of a new area of nonlinear communications including forward error correction, essential for reliable communication. Specifically, COIN will investigate the application of nonlinear Fourier transforms and nonlinearity-tailored coding and detection by effectively integrating the scientific expertise of the key academic research groups in information theory, coding, coherent optical communication and high-speed transmission with the industrial know-how of the consortium. The COIN R&D goals will be to focus on the development of new, native communication schemes and waveforms alongside with the development of coding schemes for these and existing non-linear Fourier transform based transceivers. The R&D tasks will be carried out along with researcher training in the leading scientific centres in Europe. The PhD training programme is designed to maximize the unique synergy between the collaborators to promote career opportunities of the COIN researchers in ICT, generating new types of key expertise and and human capital for the European Research Area.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

{"text":"Title: RAPID - Heterogeneous Secure Multi-level Remote Acceleration Service for Low-Power Integrated Systems and Devices Abstract: Many low-power devices such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks as well as several other embedded systems can't always cope with the increased demand for processing power, memory and storage required by modern applications in gaming, vision, security, robotics, aerospace, etc. As a result, most such applications are only executed on high-end servers.\n\nRAPID tackles this challenge by taking advantage of high-performance accelerators and high-bandwidth networks. Following our approach, compute or storage intensive tasks are seamlessly offloaded from the low-power devices to more powerful heterogeneous accelerators, supporting multiple virtual CPUs and GPUs. We propose, for the first time, a secure unified model where almost any device or infrastructure, ranging from smartphone, notebook, laptop and desktop to private and public cloud can operate as an accelerated entity and\/or as an accelerator serving other less powerful devices in a secure way.\n\nRAPID offers a registration mechanism, which permits the accelerated entities to automatically find and connect to nearby accelerators with the required resources. Next, a runtime system, running on each such accelerated entity, takes into account several parameters such as the local status, the environmental conditions, the task requirements, and the status of the accelerators it is connected to in order to decide whether local tasks (or incoming tasks if the entity also acts as an accelerator) should be executed locally or remotely. Novel scheduling algorithms, admission control policies, Service Level Agreements and license policies are employed to serve multiple accelerated applications efficiently on heterogeneous cloud infrastructures.\n\nAn easy-to-use task-based programming model will be defined, while a novel runtime will automatically offload and execute the tasks transparently to the programmer. Within the RAPID project the first public acceleration cloud service will become available and commercially exploitable.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: MARCONI - Multimedia and Augmented Radio Creation: Online, iNteractive, Individual Abstract: Nowadays, radio shows surpass linear broadcast feeds by increasingly revolving around user engagement, which encompasses audience interaction and experience personalisation. Indeed, a typical consumer increasingly interacts with the radio station through digital platforms and social media. Unfortunately, the tools to enable radio-makers to capitalize on these new kinds of media and interaction opportunities are premature at best, and are in addition ill-aligned with contemporary radio production workflows.\n\nMARCONI aims to bring radio experiences to the next level, enabling radio to safeguard its strong position in the European media market, while at the same time facilitating innovative ways of radio making. The goal is to enable fully interactive and personalised radio solutions, integrating broadcast radio with digital and social media, amounting to converged radio experiences. To realize this goal, MARCONI will pursue two concrete objectives. First, consumers will be able to interact with \u201clive\u201d radio through their preferred communication channel in ways that are richer than is feasible today, so that consumers feel more connected to the radio brand -even when not listening linearly- and better served in an individual way. Second, radio-makers will be given an integrated view on audience interactions and will be supported by interaction automation services. The net outcome will be enhanced audience engagement.\n\nMARCONI brings together a multi-disciplinary consortium to realize its vision. Several partners will focus on AI to automate processing of audio-visuals, text and social media posts. A radio redaction solutions provider is represented in the consortium to guarantee smooth integration in real operational workflows. MARCONI also includes broadcasters which will organise large-scale pilots with their respective communities. Finally, strong industry participation (SMEs and radio stations) ensures that the MARCONI market potential will be properly exploited.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}

{"text":"Title: iCIRRUS - intelligent Converged network consolIdating Radio and optical access aRound USer equipment. Abstract: To meet the high throughput demands envisaged for 5G networks, with increased user densification and bandwidth-hungry applications, while at the same time reducing energy consumption, iCIRRUS proposes an intelligent Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) that brings together optical fibre technology, low-cost but highly flexible Ethernet networking, wireless resource management for device-to-device (D2D) communication (incl. the use of mm-wave spectrum) and the use of virtual mobiles in the cloud. The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul\/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G \u2013 of the order of 100 Gb\/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure. Finally, the intelligent network functions in ICIRRUS can interact with mobile cloud processing, and further offloads of infrastructure communications can be realised through virtualising mobiles in the cloud as clones, and performing communication tasks between clones.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: PABLO - Power Amplifier Design Through Behavioural Modelling Abstract: 5G base-stations will make use of large antenna arrays (hundreds of elements), potentially with each radiating element fed independently, meaning 1 power amplifier (PA) per element. This situation, combined with the trend of removing the circulator from the PA output for cost and size reasons, the design of the PA needs to take into account for the interaction with the other array elements. As a consequence, the simulation in CAD using traditional transistor models with a large number of internal nodes could become inconvenient, and the use of a behavioral model for the transistor could be an interesting choice.\n\nThe project objective is to design 5G RF Doherty PAs for the 5G sub- 6 GHz band using transistor behavioral model. The Cardiff Model will be applied for the first time in a Doherty design, guiding the necessary model changes not only to adapt the model to this application, but also exploiting the advantages that the model can give. Moreover, thanks to his knowledge of Doherty, Jorge will identify a procedure to minimize the number of measurements needed to extract the model. In this way, Jorge will enhance his knowledge by working on behavioral modelling (model extraction, implementation in CAD, and modifications) and waveform measurements. CHFE will improve his range of expertise by hosting a design expert and developing the model for a timely and actual application.\n\nThis research program is framed in one of the EU2020 targets, which is the efficient use of energy, as an important issue related to the climate change and energy sustainability of the world.

Most elderly people want to remain independent in their own homes for as long as possible. This decision can cause their children to worry about their parents\u2019 wellbeing. This is when technology enabled care services (TECS), such as telecare and telehealth, provides a solution. TECS revenues in the EU28+2 countries reached an estimated \u20ac1.89 billion in 2013. \n\nTo cope with this demand, next-generation telecare and tele-health platforms need to be enriched with innovative products. However, current monitoring devices for the elderly, can be divided into two types. The first is nothing more than a panic button connected to a 24-hour emergency telephone operator. It does little, costs a lot, and results in a lot of false alarms. The second kind is an incredibly complex, medical device that is beyond most seniors\u2019 (and carers\u2019) understanding which prevents mass market adoption. \n\nLoc8tor HealthCare (Loc8torHC), a disruptive, cost effective, scalable TECS platform targeted at the retail market.

Compared to the conventional battery-powered communication networks, WPCN is in general more convenient by eliminating the hassle of connecting cables, more cost-effective by enabling on-demand energy supplies and maintenance-free operations, more environmental-friendly by avoiding tons of battery disposal yearly, and is sometimes essential for scenarios where manual battery replacement\/recharging is too dangerous (e.g., in hazardous environment) or even impossible (e.g., for biomedical implants).  However, the practical deployment of WPCN is hampered by several critical issues, such as the low end-to-end WPT efficiency over a long  distance, the inter-play between power and information transmissions within the same network, and the challenges of scalability in large networks.

{"text":"Title: KoolZone - KoolZone- refrigeration control technology to minimise food waste, avoid food poisoning and minimise energy consumption Abstract: The respected environmentalist David Hawken recently assessed that better refrigerant management could reduce global CO2 emissions by 96t globally by 2050. Demand for refrigeration is growing, driven by developing countries and implementation of food safety legislation, e.g. HACCP. Better management of refrigeration is a clear part of better refrigerant management. Increased refrigeration and legislation is a proportionate response to the million food poisoning cases diagnosed annually in the UK, 500 of which result in death. Food temperature monitoring in commercial sectors is mandatory in the UK, EU, US, Far East & Australia, where HACCP compliance is used to safeguard food safety. The majority of food producers, handlers, caterers and retailerls uses manual records due to the high cost (\u20ac600 hardware only)  and complication of retrofitting automated logging or more efficient control. Many businesses over-cool to avoid bad press & litigation from ill customers, needlessly increasing energy consumption. The lack of 24\/7 monitoring also leads to stock loss for food businesses. If a refrigeration unit fails out of hours, the operator will not know for several hours, meaning that stock is no longer fit for consumption.   \nOur focus is to create a disruptive, very low cost (\u20ac7.50\/month) complete refrigeration monitor and reporting system (inc. SaaS) for only \u20ac110 up front hardware cost. We have solved technical challenges around battery life, low-power electronics, enclosure design and antenna design. Our prototypes are genuine plug-and-play with zero on-site integration costs. They enable 24\/7 refrigerator montiroing, plus a user portal with functionality to generate reports to satisfy HACCP inspections. This project seeks to scale-up our innovation, enhancing manufacturability and porting to scalable, secure communication and network protocols.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: PeTSoC - Lightweight and Flexible All-Perovskite Triple-junction Solar Cells Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources of the 21st century. For solar cells, the most important aspects for commercialization are power conversion efficiency and cost which can be combined into a \u20ac\/W metric. Today, over 90% of the global solar industry is comprised of single-junction crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, however, c-Si solar cells have some limitations. The first is their non-mechanically flexible nature and second, their single-junction limit of efficiency which can be surpassed by multijunction technology. Lead-halide perovskites are generating substantial scientific and industrial interest because they are low-cost, highly efficient and bandgap tunable, key criteria for multijunction solar cells. Furthermore, perovskites can be deposited via thermal co-evaporation meaning that the devices in this project, can be made from start-to-finish entirely from industrially attractive vacuum deposition techniques. Unlike conventional c-Si, perovskites are a thin-film technology, which means they can be made into lightweight and flexible solar cells with a high power-to-weight ratio. Thus, they have additional applications for (1) portable electronic devices including smartphones and displays, (2) vehicles, drones and aircraft, (3) wearable textiles, and more. The project draws from two distinct areas of photovoltaics research, specifically lightweight and flexibility with high-efficiency achieved by multijunction technology, allowing it to compete competitively with crystalline silicon in conventional solar energy generation and niche applications. The experienced researcher will be joining StranksLab to build a strong fundamental photophysical understanding of thermally co-evaporated perovskite layers via state-of-the-art spectroscopy tools to target the development of a lightweight and flexible all-perovskite triple-junction solar cell with an efficiency >30%.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

While simultaneously relieving end-users from the inconvenience of dealing with textual passwords, the OCTAVE platform will reduce the economic and practical burdens related to password loss and recovery. The TBAS will support single (text-dependent, text-prompted and text-independent) in addition to hybrid operating modes. The delegation of authentication to a single, yet distributed TBAS, will increase trust and privacy, avoid single points of failure and allow for rapid breach notification and remediation.\nSolutions will be installed in data-sensitive and mission-critical services and validated in two real commercial trials: banking services and physical access within a critical airport infrastructure. Flexibility will support wider exploitation in future applications in, for example, customer care, telephone banking, e-commerce, logical and physical access control. OCTAVE will thus fuel new opportunities for commercial services making use of electronic identification and authentication.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

However, data is fragmented, key information is lacking, and the resulting knowledge gap prohibits policy makers and companies to make effective public health nutrition strategies and reformulation of food products. Making \u201cthe healthy the easy choice\u201d requires knowledge on the context of personal life style choices of EU-citizens. \nRICHFIELDS will design a world-class infrastructure for innovative research on healthy food choice, preparation and consumption of EU-citizens, closely linked to their behaviour and lifestyle. This unique RI will bridge the gap by linking the agri-food and nutrition-health domains and account for the regional and socio-economic diversity of the EU. The RI will be instrumental to produce a scientifically reliable, technically sound and socio-legally robust evidence-base that enables scientists to efficiently collect, unlock, connect and share research data of EU-citizens. \nConsumers are central to the design: they harbour crucial information, as they increasingly adopt mobile apps and tech-wear, get access to e-business data and even medical information. Collectively, such real-life-time data create new opportunities for research, by e.g., monitoring of food-behaviour providing personalized feedback.  For further testing, detailing and underpinning and theory-building,  interfaces will be created to distributed facilities for experimental research, e.g., virtual supermarkets. Further enrichment of data is achieved via interfaces with information systems for food and health.\nThe consumer-focus and the scientific evidence of RICHFIELDS will, via its services, be available to (a) EU-consumers and consumer platforms, (b) stakeholders along the food chain, and (c) policy actors in the agri-food and nutrition-health domain.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

A potential solution of deploying LSAA indoors is to embed it into building structures, e.g., concrete walls.

First, we will define metrics so that the wireless performance of CEAA can be measured. EM properties of concrete and the inhomogeneity of EM properties will be taken into account. Then, we will establish the relationship between the ratio and layout of admixtures and the EM properties of concrete. Three simplified concrete model, i.e., multilayer, lattice and 3D Poisson point process (PPP) models, will be proposed and verified through simulations and measurements. Finally, we will design concrete with desirable EM properties by changing the ratio and layout of admixtures under the constraint of mechanical performance to obtain an optimal wireless performance.

{"text":"Title: SimuSafe - SIMULATOR OF BEHAVIOURAL ASPECTS FOR SAFER TRANSPORT Abstract: Road transport is known to be the most dangerous of all transport modes and poses a major societal challenge for EU. It has been claimed that 90% of road-traffic crashes are caused by driver error, being a significant factor in traffic accidents. Improving road safety means understanding the individual and collective behaviour of actors involved (drivers, two wheelers, pedestrians) and their interaction between themselves and safety-related systems and services. The goal of SIMUSAFE (SIMUlator of Behavioural Aspects for SAFEr Transport) following the FESTA-V model methodology is to  develop realistic multi-agent behavioural models in a transit environment where researchers will be able to monitor and introduce changes in every aspect,  gathering data not available in real world conditions. \nDriving simulators of several vehicles (cars, motorcycles, bicycles) and Virtual Reality (for pedestrians) will be used to simulate test environments. This will also enable the evaluation of scenarios which are not possible even with naturalistic driving (dangerous conditions, multiple monitored actors in the same scene, under influence of substances). Data collected from simulations will be correlated with naturalistic driving tests, such that the simulation and model aspects are the closest possible to real world data. From the developed model and collected data, impacting factors causing an event (crash, near-collision, infractions) from the environment and road users will be identified and quantified. Such knowledge will be the base for the development of more effective and pro-active measures for the prevention and mitigation of such factors, with subsequent impact in the safety devices market, regulations and driver education.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}

{"text":"Title: BEACON - Hybrid Digital-Analog Networking under Extreme Energy and Latency Constraints Abstract: The objective of the BEACON project is to (re-)introduce analog communications into the design of modern wireless networks. We argue that the extreme energy and latency constraints imposed by the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm can only be met within a hybrid digital-analog communications framework. Current network architectures separate source and channel coding, orthogonalize users, and employ long block-length digital source and channel codes, which are either suboptimal or not applicable under the aforementioned constraints. BEACON questions these well-established design principles, and proposes to replace them with a hybrid digital-analog communications framework, which will meet the required energy and latency constraints while simplifying the encoding and decoding processes. BEACON pushes the performance of the IoE to its theoretical limits by i) exploiting signal correlations that are abundant in IoE applications, given the foreseen density of deployed sensing devices, ii) taking into account the limited and stochastic nature of energy availability due to, for example, energy harvesting capabilities, iii) using feedback resources to improve the end-to-end signal distortion, and iv) deriving novel converse results to identify fundamental performance benchmarks.\n\nThe results of BEACON will not only shed light on the fundamental limits on the performance any coding scheme can achieve, but will also lead to the development of unconventional codes and communication protocols that can approach these limits, combining digital and analog communication techniques. The ultimate challenge for this project is to exploit the developed hybrid digital-analog networking theory for a complete overhaul of the physical layer design for emerging IoE applications, such as smart grids, tele-robotics and smart homes. For this purpose, a proof-of-concept implementation test-bed will also be built using software defined radios and sensor nodes.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

{"text":"Title: ROBORDER - autonomous swarm of heterogeneous RObots for BORDER surveillance Abstract: Border authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) across Europe face important challenges in how they patrol and protect the borders. Their work becomes more problematic considering the heterogeneity of threats, the wideness of the surveyed area, the adverse weather conditions and the wide range of terrains. Although there are several research tools and works targeting these areas independently for border surveillance, nowadays border authorities do not have access to an intelligent holistic solution providing all aforementioned functionalities.\nTowards delivering such a solution, ROBORDER aims at developing and demonstrating a fully-functional autonomous border surveillance system with unmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles, capable of functioning both as standalone and in swarms, which will incorporate multimodal sensors as part of an interoperable network. The system will be equipped with adaptable sensing and robotic technologies that can operate in a wide range of operational and environmental settings. To provide a complete and detailed situational awareness picture that supports highly efficient operations, the network of sensors will include static networked sensors such as border surveillance radars, as well as mobile sensors customised and installed on board unmanned vehicles. \nTo succeed implementing an operational solution, a number of supplementary technologies will also be applied that will enable the establishment of robust communication links between the command and control unit and the heterogeneous robots. On top of this, detection capabilities for early identification of criminal activities and hazardous incidents will be developed. This information will be forwarded to the command and control unit that will enable the integration of large volumes of heterogeneous sensor data and the provision of a quick overview of the situation at a glance to the operators, supporting them in their decisions.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: ELIOT - Enhance Lighting for the Internet of Things Abstract: So far, the Internet of Things (IoT) is narrowband with no latency constraints. A wider range of applications is envisioned for industrial manufacturing, augmented reality and autonomous cars. It makes use of artificial intelligence, where compute functions will be offloaded from devices into the cloud. Accordingly, future IoT will need wireless links with high data rates, low latency and reliable connectivity despite the limited radio spectrum. Connected lighting is an interesting infrastructure for IoT services because it enables visible light communication (VLC), i.e. a wireless communication using unlicensed light spectrum. LED luminaires have enough modulation bandwidth for high data rates and each luminaire can be used as a wireless access point. Networked VLC-enhanced luminaires will add new features to build a wireless network for the IoT. ELIOT will start from existing prototypes and develop the support for IoT services. The project will integrate the lighting infrastructure with VLC and add positioning, multicast communications and enhanced security. ELIOT will demonstrate the new infrastructure in real environments at TRL \u22656 and mobile IoT devices at TRL \u2265 4. Main project goals are to provide an open reference architecture for the support of IoT in the lighting infrastructure, build consensus reflecting the best architectural choices, contribute to standardization of lighting and telecom infrastructures in IEC, IETF, IEEE and ITU-T and provide a roadmap for IoT until 2022 and beyond. ELIOT brings together Europe\u2019s key players that cover the whole value chain, i.e. OSRAM, Philips Lighting and Tridonic as major component and luminaire makers, Maxlinear as chipmaker, NOKIA as a leading network vendor and integrator, BMW, Weidm\u00fcller and Thyssen Krupp working on industrial IoT, Deutsche Telekom and KPN as innovative operators, together with Fraunhofer HHI as a leading research institute and two top universities from Eindhoven and Oxford.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

This creates a significant need to lift existing technological barriers of actual fluidity and scalability of cloud resources towards promoting cloud computing as a critical cornerstone for digital economy.\n\nACTiCLOUD proposes a novel cloud computing architecture for drastically improved management of cloud resources, targeting 1.5x increase in resource efficiency and more than 10x in scalability. By utilizing modest investments on hardware intelligence that enables true resource disaggregation between multiple servers, we will progress current state-of-the-art in hypervisors and cloud management systems promoting holistic resource management at the rack scale and across distributed cloud sites. On top of this, we will evolve the ecosystem around in-memory databases, a core component for extremely demanding and highly critical classes of applications that up to now have faced severe difficulties in matching their resource requirements with state-of-the-art cloud offerings, with a final goal to provide cost-efficient and highly performant DataBase-as-a-Service (DBaaS) cloud platforms.\n\nACTiCLOUD builds on top of cutting-edge European technologies for cloud servers brought into the project by Numascale and Kaleao, and extends OnApp's MicroVisor, an innovative hypervisor to virtualize resources at the rack-scale.

Mobility within these areas is complex as it involves multiple modalities of transport, multiple managing authorities, as well as several millions of citizens. The cost of inefficiency in transport and mobility are enormous. For example, inefficiency costs the UK economy \u20ac5.8 billion each year. \u20ac583 million is wasted on fuel (e.g. traffic congestion) alone each year, which attributes to increased urban pollution and CO2. Hold-ups to business or freight vehicles amounts to \u20ac1.5bn annually.\nMobility generates huge amounts of data thought thousands of sensors, city cameras, and connected cars, as well as millions of citizens connected through their mobile devices. If properly managed, this data can be used to understand, optimise and manage mobility and make it more efficient, sustainable and resilient. \nSETA will address this challenge, creating a technology and methodology able to use this wealth of data to change the way mobility is organised, monitored and planned in large metropolitan areas. The solution will be able to collect, process, link and fuse high-volume, high-velocity, multi-dimensional, heterogeneous, cross-media, cross-sectorial data and to use it to model mobility with a precision, granularity and dynamicity that is impossible with today\u2019s technologies. Such models will be the basis of pervasive services to citizens and business, as well as decision makers to support safe, sustainable, effective, efficient and resilient mobility.\nThe project has the potential to impact the everyday lives of millions of people, their health and the environment with enormous financial and social impact. \nSETA\u2019s solution will be evaluated rigorously by citizens, business and decision makers in 3 cities across Europe. \nThe proposal includes a commercialisation plan and describes the economy of managing the SETA ecosystem in a metropolitan area.","gt":true,"conf":0.8}

The platform is based on the integration of proprietary technologies available to the consortium partners: an automatic water concentration cartridge combined with a microfluidic cell will provide an adequate sample to a newly designed fluorescence image cytometer whose readings will be recorded and processed using a proper software interface. It will be validated for quantifying Legionella and Escherichia coli (E. coli) population within 120 minutes from obtaining the sample, overcoming in this way the main disadvantage of traditional methods used in laboratories, i.e. long time-to results which can currently last up to 12 days in the case of Legionella and 1 day for E. coli. The targeted detection limit will be 10-100 cells\/L and 5-20 cells\/100 mL for Legionella and E.coli, respectively. Also, the new imaging cytometer will have a portable form, a size similar to a smart-phone, which will increase its versatility and widen the possibilities of onsite applications. The relevance of the project is clear when one thinks about the high risk of legionellosis in some specific industrial environments, such as cooling waters, evaporative condensers and air conditioning systems and the fact that E. coli is one of the faecal pollution index commonly analyzed for monitoring the presence of waterborne pathogens and hence the quality of bathing waters.

Unfortunately, they undergo massive conversions and are affected by land degradation processes leading to a decline in the ecosystem services they provide to some of the continent\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable human populations. Reductions in the productivity of dryland savannahs have major social and political implications, and the United Nations (UN) has labelled the accurate quantification of savannah degradation as of high priority.\n\nMonitoring the woody component of savannah land cover is, therefore, needed to enhance the understanding of broad-scale changes in savannahs & their relationship with ecosystem degradation. Over large scales, this can only be achieved in a cost-effective manner using Earth Observation (EO) technologies. The development of SAV-EO is, therefore, proposed which will employ novel remote sensing methodologies, based on thousands of freely-available optical & radar satellite data for the mapping & monitoring of fractional woody cover over the entire southern African savannah region (1,500,000km2).

Their performances are far superior to the state-of-the-art high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier, and they can operate from radio to THz frequencies. Therefore, they could potentially revolutionise almost every kind of microwave, millimetre (mm) and sub-millimetre (sub-mm) instrumentation: from observational astronomy to quantum information experiments. Their deployment as readout amplifiers could improve the heterodyne receiver sensitivity significantly, and enable the construction of large bolometric arrays.

By designing robots that are more sensitive to the user\u2019s needs, CARESSES\u2019 innovative solution will offer elderly clients a safe, reliable and intuitive system to foster their independence and autonomy, with a greater impact on quality of life, a reduced caregiver burden, and an improved efficiency and efficacy. \n\nThe need for cultural competence has been deeply investigated in the Nursing literature. However, it has been totally neglected in Robotics. CARESSES stems from the consideration that cultural competence is crucial for care robots as it is for human caregivers. From the user\u2019s perspective, a culturally appropriate behavior is key to improve acceptability; from the commercial perspective, it will open new avenues for marketing robots across different countries. \n\nCARESSES will adopt the following approach. First, we will study how to represent cultural models, how to use these models in sensing, planning and acting, and how to acquire them. Second, we will consider three (physically identical) replicas of a commercial robot on the market and integrate cultural models into them, by making them culturally competent. Third, we will test the three robots, customized for three different cultures, in the EU (two cultural groups) and Japan (one cultural group), on a number of elderly volunteers and their informal caregivers. Evaluation will be conducted through quantitative and qualitative investigation.\n\nTo achieve its groundbreaking objective, CARESSES will involve a multidisciplinary team of EU and Japanese researchers with a background in Transcultural Nursing, AI, Robotics, Testing and evaluations of health-care technology, a worldwide leading company in Robotics and a network of Nursing care homes.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: MiRTLE - Next generation, high performance, long range, standoff, concealed threat detection system to protect European citizens and critical infrastructure Abstract: Acts of terrorism aim to instil fear into Europe's citizens. Since 2000, approximately 163,000 people have died from global terrorism. In particular, attacks against citizens and urban soft targets have increased as terrorists exploit the ability of autonomous cells and lone individuals to hit civilian targets such as concerts, markets, shopping malls, airports, transport hubs, sports stadia, cinemas, bars, night clubs and tourist resorts. Recent devastating attacks across Europe clearly illustrate the increasing threat that exists. \n\nIt is impossible to deploy security personnel in sufficient numbers to protect every location. Even if security personnel are present they currently lack the technology to detect, at a safe range, concealed threats such as person borne improvised explosive devices (PBIEDs), guns and knives. There is an urgent and growing need for a cost effective, high performance, long range, concealed threat detection system. \n\nRadio Physics Solutions Ltd has developed MiRTLE (Millimetre-wave Radar Threat Level Evaluation), the world\u2019s first, high performance, long range (up to 50m), low cost, standoff \u201cconcealed threat\u201d detection system for the protection of citizens and critical infrastructure. MiRTLE is capable of screening large groups of people automatically and autonomously, without operator intervention, in real-time. Our highly innovative system detects PBIEDs, guns (including 3D printed) and knives up to a range of 50m in real-time, with targets in motion, all without privacy concerns. \n\nThe overall objective of this project is to successfully refine, scale-up and demonstrate our superior technology to our customer base. We are planning to capture an 8% market share of the improvised explosive devices (IED) and weapon detection market, which will in turn generate cumulative revenues of \u20ac161m, cumulative EBITDA of \u20ac43m by 2025 and create 302 high skilled jobs in Europe.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: realTRIPS - Redefining Variability: Evaluating Land Use and Transport Impacts on Urban Mobility Patterns Abstract: Urban mobility analysis, advanced by the emerging fine-granularity location data (e.g. smart card data, mobile phone data and social media data), has received significant attention in recent years. It has become an important subject for understanding the functionality, ever-increasing dynamism and complexity of urban space. realTRIPS aims to open a new avenue of research in urban mobility analysis using emerging automatic data by developing an analytical and modelling framework, particularly addressing variability across spatial-temporal scales. I argue that the variability of urban mobility should not be simply interpreted as a number of errors, but indicators of changes in regular human behaviours impacted by land use and transport at different scales. A deeper understanding of variability and regularity would contribute to a more accurate prediction of urban development scenarios. The relevant theories and measures on variability have been long-researched in spatial statistics, but not well applied to the context of urban mobility studies. The proposed framework will take advantage of the research progress in multi-disciplines and leverage key concepts from uncertainty in spatial analysis, time geography, and land use transport planning. Under such framework, variability will be measured in mobility patterns and integrated as a function of space and time into operational urban models for predicting impact of land use and transport on people\u2019s travel and location choices at different spatiotemporal scales. Case studies presenting typical urban contexts (i.e. London, Shenzhen, Nairobi) will be explored to demonstrate the feasibility and generic applicability of the theory, analytical methods and urban models.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: SwiftV2X - Smart mmWave and MultiRATs for Multihop Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Abstract: The push for improved driving experience, including the ultimate goal of driverless vehicles, has fueled the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Connectivity is an important enabler for CAVs, as it allows for autonomous vehicles to directly participate in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) and make collective intelligent decisions. 5G mobile networks play an important role in providing vehicular connectivity as mobile networks support mobility by default. However, the density of vehicles is high in urban areas that poses challenges for the support from mobile networks. Deploying ultra-dense small cells using millimetre wave (mmWave) communication is one promising solution since ultra-dense small cells deployment addresses the network capacity and mmWave addresses the interference arisen from the dense deployment. However, due to the relatively narrow footprint of a mmWave beam, using mmWave communication for fast moving vehicles requires careful allocation to utilise its potential and avoid selfishness in radio resource usage. This project sets an ambitious goal of designing smart and dynamic algorithms to manage mmWave beam allocations in CAV environments. The project first investigates solely on the mmWave beam allocations and proposes smart algorithm using both traditional optimisation technique for benchmarking and modern machine learning algorithms for practical operation. It then studies the radio resource allocation under multi radio access technologies (multiRATs) that is the likely deployment setup before the full mmWave small cell networks become practical in the future. Finally, our study is extended to vehicle-to-vehicle communication using mmWave that can support delay sensitive message exchanges and range extension. As experimentation needs expensive infrastructure, the foreseen secondments offer partners without infrastructure on their premises to test their design on other partners that possess the infrastructure.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

Abstract: Effective hearing ability influences individuals\u2019 overall quality of life, particularly in situations (such as in work-places, meetings, classrooms, social gatherings, or using audio devices) where unwanted noise constantly tests and challenges our audio processing capabilities. In these situations all existing hearing aids share a common underlying concept flaw due to the fixed position of the microphone and the lack of user interactivity. Coupled with inelegant and unfashionable designs, this causes many hearing-impaired individuals to opt out of using hearing aids and withdraw from these social\/work group situations.\nThe Smartphone platform is an excellent example of technology with the potential to enhance the audio experience of individuals with hearing loss whilst blurring the distinction between hearing and consumer technologies. Combined with our innovative audio separation techniques and pioneering wireless technology, it removes the social stigma and provides a significant step change in hearing market accessibility, dispensing and affordability allowing everyone to live fuller normal lives.

{"text":"Title: SONATA - Service Programing and Orchestration for Virtualized Software Networks Abstract: Virtualisation and software networks are a major disruptive technology for communications networks, enabling services to be deployed as software functions running directly in the network on commodity hardware. However, deploying the more complex user-facing applications and services envisioned for 5G networks presents significant technological challenges for development and deployment. SONATA addresses both issues.\n\nFor service development, SONATA provides service patterns and description techniques for composed services. A customised SDK is developed to boost the efficiency of developers of network functions and composed services, by integrating catalogue access, editing, debugging, and monitoring analysis tools with service packaging for shipment to an operator.\n\nFor deployment, SONATA provides a novel service platform to manage service execution. The platform complements the SDK with functionality to validate service packages. Moreover, it improves on existing platforms by providing a flexible and extensible orchestration framework based on a plugin architecture. Thanks to SONATA\u2019s platform service developers can provide custom algorithms to steer the orchestration of their services: for continuous placement, scaling, life-cycle management and contextualization of services. These algorithms are overseen by executives in the service platform, ensuring trust and resolving any conflict between services.\n\nBy combining rapid development and deployment in an open and flexible manner, SONATA is realising an extended DevOps model for network stakeholders.\n\nSONATA validates its approach through novel use-case-driven pilot implementations and disseminates its results widely by releasing its key SDK and platform components as open source software, through scientific publications and standards contributions, which, together, will have a major impact on incumbent stakeholders including network operators and manufacturers and will open the market to third-party developers.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

{"text":"Title: SPICES - Space-borne observations for detecting and forecasting sea ice cover extremes Abstract: The main objective of this proposal is to develop new methods to retrieve sea ice parameters from existing (and imminent) satellite sensors to provide enhanced products for polar operators and prediction systems, specifically addressing extreme and unexpected conditions. \nAutomatic remote sensing products traditionally provide general information on sea ice conditions such as ice extent and concentration. However, for ice charting, tactical navigation and management of off-shore activities much more important is to know and avoid hazardous sea ice conditions. In general, sea ice hazards are related to sea ice thickness. More often than not polar ships and off-shore platforms are only operating during summer seasons and certain regions. This is because they are designed to resist typical forces of induced by pack ice, but they are not designed to resist the extreme sea ice conditions. \n\nOngoing climate warming has manifested as shrinking and thinning of pack ice in the Arctic. This is a primary driver for the increasing shipping, oil and gas explorations and mining activities in the Arctic. However, severe sea ice conditions still exist and in consequence many locations are impossible for ship based operations. Moreover, year-to-year variability of sea ice is very large and hazardous multiyear ice (MYI) floes sometimes appear also in typically seasonally ice free regions.\n\nIn order to response needs of increase polar activities, we propose to focus on detection of sea ice extremes and automatic production of \u201csea ice warnings\u201d products. In particular, we aim for a detection of MYI floes in a area composed mostly first-year ice from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), heavily ridged ice regions from SAR, the thickest ice from radar altimeter (RA) thickness profiles, regional anomalies of thick or thin ice via passive microwave (PMW) data, sea ice areas vulnerable for the wave action, detection of early\/late melting season and improving capabilities to forecast seasonal sea ice extremes.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: SMARTER-2 - Surveillance of MARiTime surroundings through lasER technology Abstract: Contact and collision incidences are now the most increasing, most frequent and overall the most costly type of accidents in the maritime transport sector, representing 40% of yearly insurance claims and force 1 out of 10 ships to an unplanned dry dock every year costing on average \u20ac400,000 per incident. Semi and fully submerged objects are particularly causing havoc to shipping and offshore platforms because they go undetected by state-of-the-art sensors (radars, sonars, optical sensors) presenting an acute need for improved observation capability of the ocean surface layer. A major concern considering the importance of shipping in general (90% of world\u2019s trade), their asset value (up to \u20ac 1 Billion cost to build) and the number of people at sea (about 2 Billion transported yearly). Similarly, the maritime security situation is worsening forcing vessels in average to spend \u20ac170,000 a year on security related solutions. The project opportunity arises from today\u2019s inability to observe this challenging ocean layer, causing unsatisfying operational risks in a greatly expanding market (with more frequent and more costly security and safety incidents in line with the strong industry expansion). These incidents can be reduced by an appropriate observational sensor like a ladar. It can detect for example drifting growlers (ice floes) or floating containers ahead of a vessel, preventing damaging collisions. The information that the sensor collects can also be directly used for operators to reduce operational cost, for example by accurately observing the sea state as to optimize sail plan models and vessel trim for fuel and emission savings. Such benefits have value for the operators, allowing them to purchase a relatively low cost sensor compared to the costs of an offshore or maritime incident. Moreover, the ladar is complementary to radar, sonar, and other maritime sensors. It would therefore fill a market gap rather than outcompeting existing sensor technologies.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

Flight-critical applications in harsh environments require a fault-tolerant design. The future need for qualification has to be taken into account from the start of the development.\nThe call for proposal asks for the development of wireless slip rings for power and data transfer for a flight-critical application within the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR). This CfP is a technical and industrial challenge, which provides an opportunity for improving competitiveness on this important improvement part of the NGCTR program of the CS2 work plan.\nFor the development of Constance, NLR will combine their tiltrotor experience from the FP5 TILTAERO and FP7 NICETRIP programs with their patented wireless slip ring design and knowledge from the Contra-Rotating Open Rotor project of the CS2 Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft program.

We are presently at the verge of a second revolution of quantum science, where quantum engineering based on direct exploitation of fundamental quantum mechanical abilities such as superposition and entanglement promises entire new technologies for society. However, lack of scalability of quantum information (QI) technology remains the fundamental technical challenge preventing most QI technologies from becoming a reality - a critical bottleneck to which a new generation of researchers is urgently needed. In QUDOT-TECH we build from the semiconductor QD - the most mature QI technology - and propose a solution to the scalability obstacle in the form of a quantum network based on QDs coupled efficiently to each other using optical waveguides.

{"text":"Title: STUSOCSTA - Students, social change and the construction of the post-independence Algerian state, 1962-1978 Abstract: This project seeks to bring a new perspective to understanding state construction in Algeria after independence. Through a history of the first generations of Algerians who went to university in the 1960s and 1970s, it explores the intersections between political and institutional transformations and social, cultural and economic processes. These processes include increasing literacy, rural to urban migration, migration to study abroad and changes in gender relations and family structures. Bringing together concepts and methodologies from across a number of humanities and social science disciplines, the project will produce a case study setting out new approaches to studying state-building as a dynamic process which takes place at different levels of power (transnational, national and local) and which both shapes, and is shaped by, individual agency and wider processes. The goal is for this approach to be applicable to a range of other post-colonial contexts, challenging teleological readings of post-independence histories and homogenising understandings of post-independence states. \n\nThe project is to be carried out in Algeria, France and the UK, with the researcher working with leading experts in the field in each of these countries to create a transnational, interdisciplinary network exploring the central research themes.

{"text":"Title: SmartGraphene - Graphene based smart surfaces: from visible to microwave Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to develop adaptive camouflage systems using graphene-enabled smart surfaces. We propose a new class of active surfaces capable of real-time electrical-control of its appearance in a very broad spectrum ranging from visible to microwave covering 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The proposed method relies on controlling electromagnetic waves by tuning density of high-mobility charges on single or multilayers of atomically thin graphene electrodes. We will realize this goal by efficient gating of large-area graphene using ionic liquids which yields unprecedented ability to control intensity and phase of the reflected and transmitted electromagnetic waves from the surface. Based on underlying physical mechanisms and applications, the proposed research plan is structured in 3 main directions; (1) Active surfaces in microwave and THz, (2) Active thermal surfaces, and (3) Active surfaces in the visible. \n\nThe core idea of the proposal is based on a mutually-gated capacitor structure consisting of ionic liquid electrolyte sandwiched between two large area graphene. The voltage applied between the electrodes polarizes the ionic liquid and accumulates high-density of charges. Combining large scale chemical synthesis of graphene, novel device architectures and ionic liquid electrolyte we will develop new tools to understand and control light-matter interaction in a very broad spectrum. Then we will use these tools to fabricate new camouflage and display technologies on flexible polymers and paper substrates which cannot be realized by conventional semiconducting materials. We will challenge specific applications, such as THz compressive imaging, reconfigurable thermal shields, and electronic paper display.\n\n At the basic science level, this project revisits and challenges our basic understanding of light-matter interaction, in parallel, the proposed graphene-based smart surfaces will serve as a tool for developing new enabling technologies.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: ProTego - Data-protection toolkit reducing risks in hospitals and care centers Abstract: Health care is an essential service that uses a great deal of sensitive personal data which has a high black market value being a lucrative target for data theft and ransomware attacks.The EU NIS Directive (EU 2016\/1148) and GDPR (EU 2016\/679) will harmonize and improve information security in Europe. Both require relevant ICT infrastructure operators to perform risk assessments, introduce appropriate security measures to manage identified risks, and report security breaches. Unfortunately, risk-based approaches are notoriously difficult to implement in a consistent and comprehensive fashion. They depend on a high level of understanding of both cybersecurity and of the system or network to be protected, are labour intensive and costly and typically done by small teams. This is increasingly inappropriate as health care providers introduce IoT systems, cloud services and (in the near future) 5G networks to provide services in which patients are more engaged, may own some of the devices used, and want access in hospitals, on the move or at home.

Lack of biomarkers and\/or findings on routine MRI and CT scans, PD is left undiagnosed for years, gradually affecting the life of over 6.5 million of older adults (>55-60 yrs) worldwide, increasing the risk of their health deterioration. Epidemiological studies conclude that early intervention could have an inverse relation with the PD-related risks of progressive frailty, falls and emotional shift towards depression. Based on this evidence, the cardinal objective of i-PROGNOSIS is the development of (i) an ICT-based behavioural analysis approach for capturing, as early as possible, the PD symptoms appearance, and (ii) the application of ICT-based interventions countering identified risks. To achieve this, awareness initiatives will be employed, so as to construct i-PROGNOSIS community, targeting > 5000 older individuals within the duration of the project, in order to unobtrusively sense large scale behavioural data from its members, acquired from their natural use of mobile devices (smartphone\/smartwatch). Ensuring anonymisation and secure Cloud archiving, i-PROGNOSIS will develop and employ advanced big data analytics and machine learning techniques, in a distributed and privacy aware fashion, so as to instantiate a PD Behavioural Model and construct reliable early PD symptoms detection alarms. To those identified and clinically validated as early stage PD patients, ICT-based interventions will be provided via the i-PROGNOSIS Intervention Platform, including: a) a Personalised Game Suite (ExerGames, DietaryGames, EmoGames, Handwriting\/VoiceGames) for physical\/emotional support, b) targeted nocturnal intervention to increase relaxation\/sleep quality and c) assistive interventions for voice enhancement and gait rhythm guidance.

By doing so it delivers three things:\n\n\u2022Greater fuel efficiency \u2013 when 25% of a haulage company\u2019s costs are fuel, small fuel savings become big. With the Silent Sensors tyre management system we estimate between 2% and 6% fuel savings.\n\u2022Increased tyre life \u2013 by managing your tyres properly, you will achieve a significantly longer life for tyres. Spread over thousands of tyres used annually in a fleet, this leads to more money retained by the business.\n\u2022Much safer tyres \u2013 20% of road accidents are caused by tyre failures. When tyres are properly maintained by Silent Sensors systems, there are fewer failures, and much safer transport.\n\nSilent Sensors provides an efficient, easy tyre management system at a low cost using patented RFID technology. It measures tyre pressure, tread and temperature by simply applied sensors, allowing fleet owners to better manage one of their most vital resources. It is a precise, practical and world-leading system.\n\nThe skilled, experienced team behind Silent Sensors have brought the system to a point where trials are in progress with a large fleet truck business in the UK. The Phase 1 feasibility study will create an elaborated business case that should support the development and commercialisation of this solution, initially working with our UK trial partner, then trials in Scandinavia and India and eventual expansion to the remainder of Europe and Asia, specifically China.

Therefore, IRS represents an excellent opportunity to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless communications in indoor environments, where over 80% of wireless traffic takes place. In order to achieve the full potential of IRS for secure indoor communications, breakthroughs in the fundamental theory and key techniques for IRS-aided secure indoor communications are urgently needed, including 1) channel estimation and MIMO channel modelling for indoor environments in presence of IRS; 2) joint beamforming design at both transmit antennas and IRS to maximise the secrecy performance; and 3) performance evaluation and optimisation of key parameters of IRS for secure indoor communications at a system level.

No one likes an autonomous car that is doomed to a collision accident once every few years or months. In the real world, collision does happen at every second - more than 1.3 million people are killed by road accidents every single year. The current approaches for vehicle collision detection such as vehicle to vehicle communication, radar, laser based Lidar and GPS are far from acceptable in terms of reliability, cost, energy consumption and size. For example, radar is too sensitive to metallic material, Lidar is too expensive and it does not work well on absorbing\/reflective surfaces, GPS based methods are difficult in cities with high buildings, vehicle to vehicle communication cannot detect pedestrians or any objects unconnected, segmentation based vision methods are too computing power thirsty to be miniaturized, and normal vision sensors cannot cope with fog, rain and dim environment at night.

{"text":"Title: LocationWise - LocationWise Payment Card Validation: A cloud based location verification system that will significantly lower cost of payment card cyber security Abstract: The vision of LocationWise project is to lower fraud costs incurred by banks from \u20ac1.03 to \u20ac0.55 per transaction and thus saving Europe ca. \u20ac456 million annually. Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. \u20ac1.44 billion annually and \u20ac14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to \u20ac13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user\u2019s mobile device to determine his\/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%. Among other things, the purpose of Feasibility Study is to better understand the target market, determine optimum platform resources required to handle a given volume of transactions and to further refine IP strategy.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

The European Community faces a number of challenges both at a political and at a tactical level. Irregular migration flows exerting significant pressure to the relevant authorities and agencies that operate at border territories. Armed conflicts, climate pressure and unpredictable factors occurring at the EU external borders, have increased the number of the reported transnational crimes. Smuggling activity is a major concern for Eastern EU Borders particularly, as monitoring the routes used by smugglers is being hindered by mountainous, densely forested areas and rough lands aside with sea or river areas. Due to the severity and the abrupt emergence of events, the relevant authorities operate for a long-time interval, under harsh conditions, 24 hours a day.

{"text":"Title: SONNET - Self-OrganizatioN towards reduced cost and eNergy per bit for future Emerging radio Technologies Abstract: A revelation in today\u00b4s mobile is networks is SON (Self-Organizing technology) technology, which is seen as a playing pivotal role towards reducing the management costs of networks. In legacy networks, still many network elements and associated parameters are manually configured. The associated operations costs are significant. Specialized expertise must be maintained to tune these network parameters, and the existing manual process is time-consuming and potentially error-prone. In addition, this manual tuning process inherently results in comparatively long delays in updating values in response to the often rapidly changing network topologies and operating conditions, resulting in sub-optimal network performance. SON is capable of collecting information from the network, so as to perform self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing and etc, so as to reduce the operation cost through less human involvement, and to optimize the service quality through robust and prompt network optimization.   \n\nIn this proposal, we aim to drive further cost savings in the way networks are managed today by amplifying further the coverage zone of SON within the network. We believe that key technologies such as network sharing and Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) can benefit from SON technology solutions. We will consider a complex context-aware heterogeneous network that is slowly becoming a 5G reality, and investigate the notion of SON CoMP and SO network sharing, as key technologies to reduce cost and energy per bit in legacy and future emerging mobile technologies.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

This can be inefficient and cumbersome \u2013 clinic visits may be too infrequent to identify individuals at risk of significant changes in disease state (e.g. relapse) and place unnecessary burden on patients and providers.\n\nSmartphone and wearable technologies have led to an exponential growth in the amount of information which can be collected on patients unobtrusively and at low cost. Sensors collect data passively, and active monitoring, using experience sampling, provides information on multiple parameters. Such technologies could monitor long term outcomes of patients, at scale, and provide fine-grained information on outcomes, available in real time and at low-cost, enabling services to offer more responsive and efficient care. \n\nWhilst there is growing interest in the application of RMT in health, the field is in its infancy.

Abstract: All infrastructure that underpins life as we know it runs underground in some form whether it be telecoms, water, gas or electricity. All underground infrastructure is only accessible through one method \u2013 inspection chambers. These inspection chambers are common and 100s can exist within a small area. To prevent criminal damage to infrastructure and ensure safety, all of these chambers are covered with access covers. There have been no major innovations of access covers in recent times and most remain completely unsecure and vulnerable. Requests to increase security has resulted in simple measures taken in the form of padlocks and key-locks, which still leave significant vulnerabilities. Alongside these vulnerabilities, covers in strategic sites need daily monitoring. This is currently done manually with physical inspections. There is a significant cost incurred for this.\n\nWe are Hugslock Systems and have developed a solution that will secure all underground infrastructure. We have created iNTelligent Access Cover Technology \u2018iNTACT\u2019 that will truly revolutionize the security of underground critical infrastructures. iNTACT is the world\u2019s first remote lockable access cover.

Abstract: Most Cultural Heritage objects housed by museums are often stored under unsuitable climate conditions. APACHE will develop a cutting edge technology to control and prevent the degradation of such patrimony. The novel approach is based on three pillars: 1) advanced sensing and absorbing materials to control the artifacts\u2019 environment; 2) modeling to define the threshold of artifacts\u2019 degradation and to discriminate between the need for preventive or remedial conservation; 3) remote control of the works of art stressors. The unique combination of these pillars will reduce to the lowest possible level the costs actually required by conventional technology for art conservation. New generation of active and intelligent display cases, crates, and storage boxes, will be implemented thanks to: i) The unique APACHE partnership, comprising the most important experts in the three aforementioned pillars; ii) The development of easy-to-use sensing devices able to communicate through Wireless Sensor Networks and Radio Frequency Identification Devices thanks to Industry 4.0-5.0 ICT technologies, granting the optimal environmental conditions around the art objects. Multiscale models integrated in an open simulation environment will be used to predict the degradation of artefacts and set the properties of sensors (detection limits) and polyfunctional absorbents.

Interfacing with organs and nervous system, these devices will be a key part of future healthcare technologies. One of the most important components in such a device is the electronic integrated circuit (IC) located right at the signal source. This determines the overall power consumption and size of an implant. However, due to the need for sensitive analog circuits and toxicity concerns, very advanced silicon technology nodes (as in consumer electronics) cannot be used in such ICs. Hence, the power & area consumption is of significant concern. The primary aim of the project is to develop custom, novel ultra-low power digital cells for efficient signal processing and communication circuits for miniature wireless medical implants.

{"text":"Title: MigrationRadar - Elucidating continental-scale patterns of bird migration with weather radars Abstract: Migration is a wide-spread phenomenon which allows animals of many different taxa to take advantage of seasonal variation in resource abundance. Radar is a powerful tool to observe and track migratory flights. In this action I will use the existing European network of weather radars to investigate bird migration behaviour and patterns at the continental-scale in relation to topography, weather and insect migration. A unique aspect of this action is that I will have access not only to bird migration data from weather radars, but also to complementary data from small-scale dedicated biological radars (units specifically designed to monitor bird and insect migration), as well as bird ringing and monitoring data from several key locations (migration hotspots). Weather radars will provide data on bird migration patterns at the continental-scale (along the \u201cWestern European Flyway\u201d); the small-scale biological radars will provide more detailed information on insect and bird migration patterns at specific sites; and the ringing and monitoring data will provide species composition at specific points along the flyway. Together this will give us a unique overview of the flux and behaviour of migratory animals across Europe, something that has never before been possible.\n\nThe objectives of the work packages in this action will be:\n\nWP 1:  To describe the flux of bird migration in relation to weather and topography across the western fly-way in Europe, and relate this to insect migration at specific sites and monitoring data along the fly-way. \n\nWP 2: To investigate flight behaviour of bird and insect migrants in relation to winds at both a continental and local scale, testing theoretical predictions of how migrants should use winds optimally. \n\nWP 3: To investigate the nightly duration of bird migration across latitudes and the seasonal progression of migration.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

ICT tools (relying on QR codes) will be developed as the driver of the proposed eco-innovative services to take full advantage of the potential and synergies of two major revolutions of our time: the circular economy and the Industry 4.0. The project will thus contribute to transform the E&E sector into circular and 4.0, raising new opportunities for end-users (such as their involvement in design or the access to a product as a service) and for social and solidarity economy (conducted by NGOs, like EMAUS, which employ people at risk of social exclusion to repair and prepare WEEE for re-use). The techno-economic, environmental and social viability of the new CEBMs will be validated through demonstrations dealing with four target products belonging to different EEE categories: large household appliances, IT equipment, telecommunications equipment, and consumer equipment. These EEE categories together account for 77% of WEEE collected in the EU.\nThe project will result in an estimated economic benefit of 57.03 M\u20ac over the period 2022-2026, which taking into account the project budget (8.03 M\u20ac) yields a ROI ~ 7.1. Specifically, the project will generate in the mid-term an economic benefit of 28.4 M\u20ac\/year, with about 355 green employees (including direct and indirect jobs) and a total reduction of 2,620 tonnes CO2 eq\/year.\nC-SERVEES (10 Member States and Turkey, including industry, end-users and researchers, ensures that strategic, design and implementation decisions) will be in line with business realities and set the foundation for realistic market-ready solutions.","gt":true,"conf":0.4}

Abstract: The main objective of EMPOWER is to substantially reduce the use of conventionally fueled vehicles (CFV) in cities by influencing the mobility behaviour of CFV drivers and users towards fundamental change. To achieve this objective EMPOWER will create a set of tools for industry, policy makers and employers. These will empower them beyond the lifespan of this project to understand, help choose and successfully implement \u2018positive\u2019 evidence-based and cost-effective policy interventions, based on new and innovative mobility services, and in the context of already existing infrastructure, policy and measures. EMPOWER will reduce the use of CFV by: shifting trips to other modes\/other vehicle types, promoting sharing and self-organisation and reducing demand overall e.g. through remote access to services. Undesirable impacts from CFV use will be reduced by: shifting CFV use to outside peak times and diversions to avoid particular areas\/routes. The research will be multidisciplinary and involve: social science research with the public, 4 living lab experiments and 7 City demonstrators which will be chosen through an open 'bidding' process. The EMPOWER concept will be used in practice by: City stakeholders being able (through a software tool) to choose positive policy options based on their expected impacts and deliver incentives and social network sharing schemes to individuals using software. The innovation outputs of EMPOWER include an EMPOWER Toolkit to support industry, policy makers and employers to understand, choose and implement positive policy interventions. The Toolkit includes: new mobility services to provide innovative positive policy measures, new evidence on behavioural responses and impacts from positive incentives, improved organisational models for successful implementation of positive policy measures and innovation in the evaluation methodology for new mobility services.

{"text":"Title: LightPipe - Antiresonant Hollow Optical Fibres for a Quantum Leap in Data and Optical Power Transmission Abstract: Fibre optics has revolutionised telecommunications, enabled the widespread diffusion of the internet and profoundly impacted industrial manufacturing, metrology, medical endoscopy and structural sensing, to name but a few. In many applications however, fibres are now being operated very close to fundamental physical limits of the glass that forms their core, and this is already providing hard limits, for example, to the maximum data capacity or optical intensity that can be transmitted through them. A transformative new technological step is required to help increasing the information capacity and power delivery capability of optical fibres to keep up with the 1.5dB\/year growth in global data traffic and with the 2dB\/year raise in laser output power. Air guiding hollow core fibres can provide a natural solution, but the state of the art technology suffers from conceptual physical limitations that bound their minimum loss, maximum information capacity, and transmitted optical power and energy. This proposal addresses these global challenges by developing the \u2018ultimate\u2019 hollow core optical fibre technology based on nested antiresonant nodeless fibres. Based on a recent discovery of the PI yet to find experimental demonstration, these fibres exploit antiresonances and multiple coherent reflections from the glass membranes to achieve, unlike any other known air-guiding optical waveguide, simultaneous minimisation of surface scattering and leakage loss. By targeting a 10 times increase in data capacity and power handling and a 5 times reduction in transmission loss as compared to state-of-the-art technology, all in an ultra-low nonlinearity fibre with excellent modal purity and spectral transparency, the outcomes of this project have the potential to revolutionise telecommunications 45 years after the development of ultra-low loss glass optical fibres and to produce a step-change in many industrial and scientific high power laser delivery applications.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

The project will look into analysing, developing, implementing and testing cognitive radio algorithms. The ground breaking element in SCREEN is however the implementation and testing. Even though some of the underlying technologies for the individual stages are not novel, the incorporation of all stages in a radio transceiver has never been done to the full extent of a cognitive, and not adaptive, system.\n\nThe key enabling technology for cognitive radio is Software-Defined Radio (SDR), which provides the required flexibility to reconfigure the radio parameters autonomously and without any changes in the transceiver hardware. The Consortium will make use of proprietary SDR technology and use it for the implementation and testing. In fact, the project approach is to make use of terrestrial research results in cognitive radio at all levels (technological, market and regulatory) and capitalise the previous work done in different projects, avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts. The target spectrum band for this project is S-band, which is underexplored and has a strong potential for future niche applications both in satcom and in ISLs for multi-satellite missions. It also brings advantages regarding regulatory concerns.\n\nThis project clearly fits the topic, not only because its main goal is to evolve an innovative technology up to TRL4\/5, but also because cognitive radio is a key enabling technology for the areas identified by the topic.

{"text":"Title: GREENEDGE - Taming the environmental impact of mobile networks through GREEN EDGE computing platforms Abstract: Modern communication networks are rapidly evolving into sophisticated systems combining communication and computing capabilities. Computation at the network edge is key to supporting many emerging applications, from extended reality to smart health, smart cities, smart factories and autonomous driving. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is being developed to deliver the required computation functionalities closer to user devices, directly at mobile access points. GREENEDGE is motivated by the fact that the large scale adoption of MEC technology, while benefiting human productivity and efficiency, will result in a surge of data and computation in mobile networks, which, in turn, will exacerbate their energy consumption. GREENEDGE is set out to tame the growing carbon footprint of MEC technology, devising highly energy efficient communication and computing functionalities for the network edge, combining them with ambient energy sources and with new energy storage and supply paradigms. As a result, GREENEDGE technology will allow mobile systems to offer the much anticipated communication and computing services in a sustainable manner. Fifteen early stage researchers (ESRs) will be trained by a consortium of world-class leaders across the fields of energy harvesting, storage, edge computing, optimization, machine learning and wireless communications. Ample inter-sectoral opportunities will be offered thanks to secondments among academy\/research centers, two network operators, and other prominent industrial partners operating in the domains of Internet of Things, smart cities, critical infrastructure management and data analytics. A carefully planned and coordinated training and research program will ensure excellent employability prospects for the ESRs after the project completion.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

At the same time, attack mechanisms are increasingly sophisticated, pervading critical infrastructures despite billions of euros invested in cybersecurity measures. To address the above, SPIDER delivers an innovative Cyber Range as a Service platform that extends and combines the capabilities of existing telecommunication testbeds and cyber ranges into a unified facility for (i) testing new security technologies, (ii) training modern cyber defenders in near real-world conditions, and (iii) supporting organisations and relevant stakeholders in making optimal cybersecurity investment decisions. At its core, it is a highly customisable dynamic network modelling instrument that enables real-life virtualisation and real-time emulation of networks and systems. It also offers real-time interaction and information sharing capabilities by acting as a serious gaming repository for multiple stakeholders to share material and maximise efficiency in delivering complex cyber exercises. SPIDER\u2019s gamified learning environment enables trainees to master how to use domain-specific cyber protection technologies and collaboratively improve their ability in handling incidents and risks. Complemented by cyber econometric capabilities, SPIDER also enables users to forecast the evolution of attacks and their associated economic impact through the application of innovative risk analysis methodologies, econometric models and real-time attack emulation. The proposed cyber range model will be validated in five highly realistic pilot use case scenarios aimed at demonstrating its applicability and validity for all requirements of the SU-DS01-2018 Call (simulation, training, and economics).","gt":true,"conf":0.9}

This will help the pipeline operators to take preventive and corrective measures before any accident stemmed from pipeline failure occurs.  A low profile wireless Acoustic Emission (AE) and Long Range Ultrasonic (LRU) dual mode sensors will be permanently attached on the pipeline with a collar installed 100m apart from each other that can monitor 50m of pipeline in either side. The sensors will act in passive AE mode in normal operation and on detection of an anomaly will switch to LRU mode to locate and determine the characteristics of the anomaly. An artificial neural network (ANN) and data fusion system will intelligently manage data acquisition and analysis functions based on data received from the installed sensor nodes. An energy harvesting system will be developed to power the onsite electronics. A new software will be developed that will enable advanced signal processing with improved signal\/noise separation in handling sensor data, thus supporting more sensitive measurement and more effective analysis.\niPIM will ensure onshore pipeline safety and reduce cost due to pipeline failure in the Europe.

{"text":"Title: QUARTET - Quantum readout techniques and technologies Abstract: The general aim of this proposal is to exploit quantum information to develop new powerful methods for the retrieval and recognition of classical data from physical systems. More precisely, we aim at showing a substantial quantum-enhancement in several fundamental tasks: (1) the readout of classical data from digital memories (quantum reading); (2) the recognition of classical patterns (quantum pattern recognition); (3) the optical measurement of concentration in fragile biomedical samples (quantum bio-probing); and (4) the microwave detection of target objects (microwave quantum illumination or quantum radar). These objectives are realized starting from the optimization of a general theoretical model at their basis: quantum channel discrimination. This is then developed into technical aspects which directly support our experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations.\n\nOur experimental prototypes could open the way to much more powerful and radically new forms of information and detection technologies, with direct benefit for science and the wider society. Thanks to the superior performances in the low energy regime, quantum reading may increase data-transfer rates and storage capacities of current digital memories by orders of magnitude. Quantum pattern recognition could have remarkable long-term applications in biology and medicine, in terms of non-invasive analysis of very fragile biological samples or human tissues, and better recognizing hidden patterns associated to bacterial growths or cancerous cells. Such results could provide future non-invasive techniques of medical imaging for private and public hospitals. Finally, the realization of a working prototype of a quantum radar may have non-trivial applications for the European security technology.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: MetaVEH - Metamaterial Enabled Vibration Energy Harvesting Abstract: Increasing demand for fully autonomous wireless sensors to service the emerging technologies of the internet of things, remote and real time monitoring of vulnerable environments or self-sensing smart structures is driving a requirement for efficient and novel methods of energy harvesting. The sensor's data communication has a substantial power requirement that presents a serious constraint upon the number of sensors, and their capability. Our primary aim is to realise innovative Lead-free electromechanical energy harvesters; these will be easily installed, to power, in a clean and low-cost manner, autonomous wireless sensing devices thereby eliminating batteries and human intervention: This will revolutionise sensor applications whilst simultaneously reducing chemical waste. This is timely as in current solutions battery replacement is either logistically impossible or too expensive and batteries carry a toxic chemical cost. Solar panels have the environmental drawback of using toxic materials. In our vision of future sensor technology, with our vibration energy harvesters (VEH) as their primary power source, a battery, will become unnecessary, and their associated chemical waste will no longer occur, and these sensors will become truly autonomous. The harvester's mechanical core will draw on advanced multiresonator designs, integrating Lead-free piezoelectric patches enhanced by the unique wave control capacities of resonant elastic metamaterials. Currently microVEH, though promising, suffers due to frequency mismatch: We have the ambition to bridge the gap between different scales by leveraging the potential of metamaterials. This will dramatically increase the energy available for harvesting, and operational bandwidth. For electronic applications the integration of rectifiers in the circuitry will allow for the full exploitation of the multiresonant design.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: COLEDISO - Corporate Legitimacy in Digital Society: The Role of Citizens\u2019 Judgments in Social Media Abstract: Corporate legitimacy, defined as the social acceptance of corporate behaviour, is constructed through a process of public deliberation. In recent years, social media technologies have enabled citizens to participate in this public deliberation by discussing, critiquing, and praising corporations. Management research about corporate legitimacy, however, has so far mainly taken into account the judgments of institutional evaluators, such as news media. By drawing on communication theories and an innovative method that combines sentiment analysis with discourse analysis of social media data, this interdisciplinary research project will examine thousands of citizens\u2019 voices and their role in the process of legitimacy construction in digital society. The Researcher will be embedded within the vibrant research environment of the ETHOS Centre at the Cass Business School of the City University London, an institution with an excellent portfolio in education that is uniquely positioned academically and geographically.

{"text":"Title: CNT-QUBIT - Carbon Nanotube Quantum Circuits Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to use spin qubits defined in carbon nanotube quantum dots to demonstrate measurement-based entanglement in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture. The project makes use of spin-orbit interaction to drive spin rotations in the carbon nanotube host system and hyperfine interaction to store quantum information in the nuclear spin states. The proposal builds on techniques developed by the principal investigator for fast and non-invasive read-out of the electron spin qubits using radio-frequency reflectometry and spin-to-charge conversion.\n\nAny quantum computer requires entanglement. One route to achieve entanglement between electron spin qubits in quantum dots is to use the direct interaction of neighbouring qubits due to their electron wavefunction overlap. This approach, however, becomes rapidly impractical for any large scale quantum processor, as distant qubits can only be entangled through the use of qubits in between. Here I propose an alternative strategy which makes use of an intriguing quantum mechanical effect by which two spatially separated spin qubits coupled to a single electrical resonator become entangled if a measurement cannot tell them apart.\n\nThe quantum information encoded in the entangled electron spin qubits will be transferred to carbon-13 nuclear spins which are used as a quantum memory with coherence times that exceed seconds. Entanglement with further qubits then proceeds again via projective measurements of the electron spin qubits without risk of losing the existing entanglement. When entanglement of the electron spin qubits is heralded \u2013 which might take several attempts \u2013 the quantum information is transferred again to the nuclear spin states. This allows for the coupling of large numbers of physically separated qubits, building up so-called graph or cluster states in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture.","gt":true,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: BRISRES - The Basal Roughness of Ice Sheets from Radio-Echo Sounding Abstract: The subglacial environment beneath the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the physically least well characterised environments on Earth. Ice sheet model simulations demonstrate high sensitivity to their basal sliding parameterisation which is governed by basal roughness, the thermal state of the bed, and lithology (presence or absence or deformable sediments). Compiling observations of the current state of the glacier bed is therefore crucial for the accuracy of ice sheet modelling and future predictions of sea level change. Radio-echo sounding (RES) is the only existing geophysical technique that has sufficient data coverage to enable ice-sheet-wide information to be obtained from the bed. In general, however, quantitative analysis of radar sounding data, and integration with electromagnetic and geostatistical approaches, lags significantly behind the data availability.\n         In this fellowship I will develop an integrated framework for characterising the roughness of glacier beds; exploiting information from the electromagnetic scattering of the radar pulse and the statistics of the basal topography. This approach will enable an unprecedented characterisation of the scale dependence of basal roughness from the kilometre to the metre scale - the scale that is most relevant for basal sliding.  Via a synthesis with ice sheet models I will challenge assumptions that are made regarding basal roughness and its relationship with other geophysical data fields, enabling new radar-derived constraints to be placed upon the bed of ice sheets. Subsidiary goals include: adapting electromagnetic scattering models for fractal surfaces to ice penetrating radar; identifying and mapping regions of deformable bed; and developing a framework for combining electromagnetic scattering information from different radar systems. This fellowship represents a unique opportunity to transfer knowledge and techniques from the US geophysical radar community to European glaciology.","gt":true,"conf":0.2}

The ability to decipher brain functions and understand the neuronal communication networking properties to develop innovative solutions to treat neurological diseases remains one of the biggest challenges to date. A recent approach to study the brain is optogenetics. Optogenetics is a neural modulation technique which utilizes light to stimulate genetically engineered neurons, providing a better option for controlling the cells compared to conventional electrical stimulation.  Scientists pursuing optogenetic therapies still face some technical challenges (e.g. size and multifunctional capability, biointegration, wireless capability, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatibility) that keeping optogenetics from clinical trials for brain diseases.

This is a wake up call for manufacturers and operators to provide users with ubiquitous, high speed and high quality wireless coverage. The 5G cell densification is the only available route due to the constraints of sub-6GHz networks. A dense deployment of small cells requires a capillary backhaul and novel approaches to fronthaul. While the increase of data rate at small cell level has found solutions, the quest for high-density backhaul remains still unanswered. The fiber is too expensive and of difficult deployment. The wireless backhaul is the preferred solution for operators for performance, flexibility and cost. The traffic demand requires an upshift from microwave to high capacity millimeter wave backhaul, and overcome the current technology limits. ULTRAWAVE responds to the challenge of high capacity, high cell density backhaul by proposing, for the first time, the exploitation of the whole millimeter wave spectrum beyond 100 GHz. This will be used to create an ultra capacity layer providing more than 100 Gbps per kilometer square in Point to Multi point at D-band (141 \u2013 174.8 GHz) over 500 m radius of coverage, fed by novel G-band (300 GHz) Point to Point high capacity links with more than 600 m range.

{"text":"Title: iBoard - Large scale interactive multi-touch displays Abstract: There is currently an established worldwide market worth annually more than $2 billion for interactive whiteboards. These whiteboards are mainly used in schools and other educational establishments. The end-users expect that a new generation of interactive whiteboards will support multi-touch finger input, yet current touch sensing solutions, while adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a large display, are striving to meet the technical specification for multi-touch interfaces. Our technology will disrupt this existing market. Alterix has invented a novel, highly efficient and low-cost electronic solution for measuring touch inputs.  By achieving a hundred-fold increase in the measurement speed compared to the touch interfaces commonly used in tablets and mobile phones, our technology scales easily to large displays with  diagonal sizes up to 250cm and is compatible with interactive whiteboards and flat-panel TVs. To serve the educational market the cost of interactive transparent TV display overlays must be reduced by replacing the indium \u2013 a critical raw material in short supply - which otherwise would be used to build the transparent sensor grid. To achieve this goal Alterix is transferring the inexpensive technology for making laminated ultrafine (nearly invisible) wires developed in the last decade for heating the windscreens of modern cars.  \n\nIt is now of strategic importance for Alterix to study the feasibility of establishing a functional supply chain, preferably within Germany and Portugal, for manufacturing TV display overlays and interactive whiteboards at the affordable cost point, validate possible issues with the manufacturing yields caused by novel aspects of the integration of large area electronics, and to articulate the company\u2019s commercialisation plans. The outcomes of the project will help to establish a pilot production capability and to secure further investment in scaling up our business with possible support from Phase 2 funding.","gt":true,"conf":0.6}

The network is interdisciplinary, intersectoral, unconventional and ambitious. It is unconventional in the sense that it connects stakeholders from seemingly separately developed fields: computational harmonic analysis, numerical linear algebra, computer algebra, nonlinear approximation theory, digital signal processing and their applications, in one and more variables. It is ambitious because the consortium stretches from mathematics to computational science and engineering and industry.  Multi-exponential analysis might sound remote, but it touches our daily lives in many surprising ways, even if most people are unaware of how important it is. For example, a substantial amount of effort in signal processing and time series analysis is essentially dedicated to the analysis of multi-exponential functions. Multi-exponential analysis is also fundamental to several research fields and application domains that are the subject of the EXPOWER proposal: remote sensing, antenna design, digital imaging, testing and metrology, all impacting some major societal or industrial challenges such as energy, transportation, space research, health and telecommunications.  The EXPOWER Beneficiaries and Third Country Partners, each bringing in their own complementary expertise, aim at solving some core challenges where the different domains involved with multi-exponential analysis meet.

But there is a novel and fundamental aspect of devices based on quantum-mechanical principles that has just started to be explored: Quantum computers can preserve the privacy of computations. This aspect is a distinct new advantage of quantum computers over their classical counterparts. An entire class of unprecedented computations becomes feasible, in which the user data and the whole computation remain perfectly private \u2013 a feature impossible to achieve with classical computers. The main focus of this project is to exploit this feature and to implement secure photonic quantum information processing in distributed quantum networks. These networks consist of clients and small-scale quantum computers connected by communication channels. Photons are chosen as they are the ideal carriers for sending information over long distances. The clients can securely delegate computations to the quantum computers, such that neither the data nor the computation is revealed to the computers or any potential eavesdropper. The project will, first, elucidate how quantum resources boost the security of classical computations; second, demonstrate secure quantum computations over long distances and study their verification; and third, examine practical security aspects of implementations. The research will leverage the experimental state-of-the-art by adapting new photonic quantum technologies such as integrated photon sources and waveguide quantum circuits. Moreover, highly-efficient superconducting detectors will be applied to achieve excellent quantum control of the photons.

Intrinsic and acquired resistance of the tumor and adverse reactions in the co-irradiated surrounding normal tissues dampen a successful therapy outcome. Substantial improvements are now expected from biologically optimized, personalized radiotherapy. This network is built on the premises that integration of novel-emerging radiobiological and tumor-biological concepts into current standard-of-care will improve outcome of radiotherapy-treated cancer patients. As the field of radiobiology is small in individual countries, it is essential to cooperate on the European level to achieve a critical mass for innovation in research and training. \nThe partners in this network will stimulate outstanding science to understand the plasticity of an altered tumor metabolism and tumor microenvironment, including the immune system, prior to, and in response to radiotherapy, as well as related dose-limiting adverse effects in normal tissues.

It is vital to determine how high CO2 impacts fish in freshwater and marine environments and to elucidate mechanisms limiting performance in the wild and aquaculture. Here, I propose an integrative approach that simultaneously investigates multiple physiological processes to comprehensively evaluate the impacts of combined endogenous (i.e. feeding) and exogenous (i.e. salinity and CO2) factors on fish, and their essential capacity to maintain a constant internal environment (i.e. homeostasis). This will be achieved by investigating cardiovascular, metabolic and homeostatic responses of the economically important rainbow trout to feeding and exercise, in freshwater and seawater, following long-term acclimation to varying levels of CO2 (reflecting climate change and aquaculture scenarios). The project will have far-reaching impact, as it will not only improve predictions of the impacts of climate change on fish, but will also provide aquaculture industry with specific recommendations for achieving maximum growth efficiency and health of farmed fish. The expertise and unique skills I bring concerning in vivo cardiovascular physiology, will be combined with the entirely new and complementary repertoire of advanced skills I will learn from Prof. Wilson (i.e. 33 years experience investigating acid-base, ion and osmotic regulation in fish at levels from the gene to the whole animal) and our collaborators (i.e. mitochondrial bioenergetics analyses and aquaculture industry expertise).

The percentage of hearing-impaired people will rise from around 16% of the adult EU population now to around 40% in 2030. Hearing aid (HA) fitting is the most widely prescribed solution for hearing impairment. However, only around 30%-40% of adults with hearing impairment use HAs in daily life. One of the reasons for this is that methods used to develop and evaluate HAs are still not based on conditions in which HAs are actually used. Thus the potential of improved HA technology to meet the needs of individual users in their daily lives is acutely under-exploited. The science in HEAR-ECO will help to facilitate the paradigm shift which is needed to bridge the gap. Such a paradigm shift requires a new generation of hearing scientists that are able to integrate conventional Audiology with Motivational and Social psychology (motivation to listen, cognition), Psychophysiology (pupillometry, PEP, EEG), and HA technology.

E-LOBSTER intends to capture such potential through the development of an innovative, economically viable and easily replicable electric Transport-Grid Inter-Connection System that will be able to establish synergies between power distribution networks, electrified transport networks (metro, trams, light railways etc.) and charging stations for EVs. The proposed solution encompasses the integration of high power flow Electric Storage with smart Soft Open Points providing flexible control. The system will be managed by an integrated Railway + Grid Management System which starting from the real time analysis of energy losses will be able to optimize the interexchange of electricity between the networks maximizing local RES self-consumption. The hardware and software control platform will be demonstrated at TRL 6 in one substation owned by Metro de Madrid. Business models and standardisation needs will be deeply analyzed and measures to unlock existing barriers will be promoted and in parallel the knowledge generated from the project will be further exploited for the definition of the up-scale design of a full scale E-LOBSTER system, paving the ground towards replication across the EU.","gt":false,"conf":0.9}

We are PragmatIC Printing Ltd, pioneers of design, development and manufacture of non-silicon ICs on plastic. Our FlexICs are; thinner than a human hair; ultra-flexible and offered in flattering form factors and footprints that conventional silicon cannot offer. Our processes allow FlexICs to be produced on a large scale at a low cost; the marginal cost per IC in volume production can be <\u20ac0.1c. Non-silicon ICs bring many new potential market applications previously unattainable with conventional technology. FlexICs that are visually unobtrusive are ideal for integration onto goods packaging, controlled documents, and others. During Phase 1, we validated the market potential for our FlexICs. A conservative estimate shows a demand for 800bn FlexICs p\/a, which is a fraction of the full 40trillion p\/a potential.\n\nIn order to facilitate this demand, we want to enable localised FlexIC production capacity for packagers, integrators and component manufacturers for immediate integration into end-products. Our solution is to develop a \u2018factory-in-a-box\u2019; a self-contained, modular and autonomous production facility containing all of our novel processes. This FlexLogIC plant will deliver the FlexICs required cost effectively at market accepted price levels. We have strong documented need and demand pull from market leading companies such as Crown Packaging, Cartamundi, Molex and SMARTRAC and others for an integrated solution such as FlexLogIC.\n\nWithin 2 years, we will develop an entry-level module (ELMo) with capacity to produce upto 800m FlexICs p\/a. The 5-year forecasts conservatively show a net cash inflow of \u20ac63.1m (mostly from license fees) by 2022 with an ROI of 47%. We are currently the only Company with the capability to supply an autonomous facility for high-volume manufacture of FlexICs.","gt":false,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: CAST - Active Monitoring of Cancer As An Alternative To Surgery Abstract: When a patient is discovered to have cancer, one of the primary goals is to have the tumour removed by surgery. Although\nthis provides excellent oncological control, it is associated with morbidity and functional problems in cancer survivors. Recent\nstudies have shown that the immediacy to perform a resection does not always lead to improved clinical outcome.\nFurthermore, cancer surgery can often lead to complications where the quality of life for the patient is compromised by toxic\nside effects and \/or damage to nerves, organs or healthy tissues. A number of recent clinical trials in the field of cancer\nsurgery have advocated the concept of watch and wait, watchful waiting, active monitoring or surveillance, which are terms\nused to describe a monitoring strategy for cancer. The concept may be antithetical but the functional advantage of these\nalternatives is clear even though there is some concern about the risk. Though the evidence is still weak, current studies\nsuggest that with adequate selection and follow-up, this oncological risk is small. A major consideration for clinicians is now\nto maintain quality of life for all patients. Our objective in this proposal is to implement novel approaches so that cancer\nsurgery can be avoided, where we aim to (a) develop new monitoring technologies from industry so that the surveillance\nwindow can be increased to allow for better treatment options over time and to avoid surgery, (b) develop new \u2018watch and\nwait\u2019 strategies in order to study the behaviour of the cancer so that any risks to the patient can be minimised leading to a\nbetter clinical outcome and (c) train a new generation of preclinical and clinical scientists to be able to implement this new\nconcept as standard of care and to maximise the benefits of an active monitoring policy.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Europe has 44% of wave energy patents as well as some of the best resources on its Atlantic coastlines.  Wave energy technology has, however, not yet achieved commercial viability and conventional public technology innovation support schemes have had only limited success.  Convergence\/consolidation is needed to deliver the technology the market requires.  Without this, investors and industrial developers will not have the confidence to engage with the sector and help make it a significant contributor to the future low carbon energy mix.\n\nEuropeWave builds on the success of the regionally funded PCP programme known as Wave Energy Scotland (WES), set up in 2014 and expands this concept to the European level as mandated by the SET Plan Implementation Plan for ocean energy.  WES will be the coordinator of the proposed EuropeWave project and lead a \u2018Buyers Group\u2019 of public authorities from the UK (Scotland - WES) and the Basque Country (EVE). The consortium is completed by Ocean Energy Europe, the sector\u2019s representative body, who will enable the widest possible engagement with those influential stakeholders able to maximise the environmental, economic and social benefits of wave energy technology for Europe. \n\nEuropeWave brings together over \u20ac22.5m of national, regional and EU funding to provide the boost to Europe\u2019s wave energy innovation community necessary to transition to commercial viability. This will be achieved by procuring a phased competitive programme of R&D to pull forward those technologies that can demonstrate the best potential to achieve the technical and economic performance metrics that will make them investor-ready.

{"text":"Title: MUSIQ - Multiphoton Microscopy and Ultrafast Spectroscopy: Imaging meets Quantum Abstract: In the quest to decipher the chain of life from molecules to cells, the biophysical questions being asked increasingly demand techniques that are capable of identifying specific biomolecules in their native environment at the smallest possible scale, and measuring their interactions quantitatively without perturbing the system under observation. Laser-based optical microscopy is a key technology to drive this progress in the 21st century. Still, many challenges remain in particular toward i) achieving imaging with biomolecular specificity without the artefacts from sample staining, ii) quantitative imaging, and iii) single molecule sensitivity. Progress toward biomolecular specificity at very high temporal resolution has been brought by the development of ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, able to address the importance of quantum coherences with the potential to unravel the fundamental machinery of Nature. Yet, measuring quantum phenomena with an optical microscope is technically challenging, and far from real-world biological applications. MUSIQ is designed as an innovative research and training network, where we will recruit 15 Early Stage Researchers to work toward the central ambitious goal of developing the next-generation optical microscopy exploiting quantum coherent nonlinear phenomena. The network brings together a unique team of 7 world-leading academics and 6 high tech companies at the forefront of optical microscopy and ultrafast laser technology developments merged with fundamental understanding of coherent light-matter interaction phenomena, development of quantitative image analysis tools, and biomedical\/pharmaceutical real-world applications. MUSIQ will establish an intersectoral training and research programme at the physics\/chemistry\/life science interface with partners from 9 European countries, aimed at creating the next generation of skilled well-connected scientists that will pioneer the \u2018quantum microscopes of tomorrow\u2019.","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

This study is crucial to understand how communities living in the Channel coastlands became interdependent at a time when trade in tin and copper was strenghtening the foundations for an extensive prehistoric European union. Central to the project is the study of burials within their human, social, and natural environments using Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis. The project is interdisciplinary, rooted in archaeology but borrowing concepts, methods, and data from geography and environmental sciences. This project will enable the fellow to achieve the research and transferable skills, which will allow him to become a mature independent researcher and international expert of the EBA northwestern Europe. The fellow will be able to apply the most up-to-date GIS skillset to different problems in the field of prehistoric archaeology, which will extend an exciting research career. This project offers the opportunity to the fellow to conduct innovative research and transnational mobility while providing benefits for the European Research Area, the Bournemouth University, the supervisor, the partner organisation and the fellow. This project will allow the fellow to develop a research agenda that will lead to a range of research and consultancy projects with European academic and non-academic institutions for the better understanding of EBA societies and cross-Channel relationships, thus enhancing research excellence and addressing recognized research questions in Europe, and beyond. Finally, the fellow aims to offer civil society the demonstration of how and why both sides of the Channel became socially and economically interdependent in the past is relevant to considering the future of our societies.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Gordon Brown stated in 2002: \u201cThere will be no return to boom and bust\u201d but in 2007\/08 the Global Financial Crisis triggered the Great Recession, the deepest recession since the 1930s. Mainstream macro (representative agents, complete markets, competitive\/monopolistic behavior, full information) was criticized rightly or wrongly for failing to predict the crisis. But the field is now undergoing a significant change introducing financial frictions, partial information, heterogeneous agents, non-competitive behavior etc. to study macroeconomic fluctuations. This high-risk project will make fundamental contributions to this new agenda and will do so in an ambitious and unusual integrative fashion using both empirical and theoretical approaches.\n\nThe proposal has three aims each of which has several sub-projects. The first focuses on methods for dynamic causal analysis. We develop methods for dynamic causal analysis in the face of permanent and transitory shocks using external instruments. The second provides new evidence on the sources of business cycles and their propagation. We examine the dynamic macroeconomic effects of \u201cmarket power\u201d by producing a new narrative record of regulatory changes. We will also study the macroeconomic impact of expectational shocks unrelated to \u201cfundamental\u201d shocks. The third aim builds quantitative theory. Dynamic general equilibrium models will be used understand the impact of market power focusing on intangible customer market effects. We apply heterogeneous agents models with aggregate shocks to examine financial frictions and macro prudential regulation in models with idiosyncratic risk. We study expectations-driven fluctuations in incomplete markets models. We estimate models with incomplete markets and price rigidities which provides a contribution across the three aims.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: EPICut - Molecular mechanisms, evolutionary impacts and applications of prokaryotic epigenetic-targeted immune systems Abstract: Interactions between bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) have led to the evolution of a wide range of bacterial mechanisms to resist viral infection. The exploitation of such systems has produced true revolutions in biotechnology; firstly, the restriction-modification (RM) enzymes for genetic engineering, and secondly, CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing. This project aims to unravel the mechanisms and consequences of prokaryotic immune systems that target covalently-modified DNA, such as base methylation, hydroxymethylation and glucosylation. Very little is known about these Type IV restriction enzymes at a mechanistic level, or about their importance to the coevolution of prokaryotic-phage communities. I propose a unique interdisciplinary approach that combines biophysical and single-molecule analysis of enzyme function, nucleoprotein structure determination, prokaryotic evolutionary ecology, and epigenome sequencing, to link the molecular mechanisms of prokaryotic defence to individual, population and community-level phenotypes. This knowledge is vital to a full understanding of how bacterial immunity influences horizontal gene transfer, including the spread of virulence or antimicrobial resistance. In addition, a deeper analysis of enzyme function will support our reengineering of these systems to produce improved restriction enzyme tools for the mapping of eukaryotic epigenetics markers.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: SHERO - Self-HEaling soft RObotics Abstract: \"While artificial intelligence, robotics and computing power advance at a stunning pace, the physical interactions between such systems remain as an unsolved question. Replacement aftermarket parts for robotics account for $400 billion a year. This figure, comparable to the entire GDP of Belgium, could be reduced if smart materials were combined with robotics and AI to heal robotic parts or prevent damage. The natural healing function has inspired chemists to impart similar properties to synthetic materials, creating \u201cself-healing materials\"\". These materials have the ability to recover their key-properties after damage through a self-healing (SH) mechanism. A broad range of SH materials has been developed, based on a variety of chemical and physical principles, and has led to innovative applications. While Europe was well positioned in the discovery of new SH materials, this project aims to take a leading position in an emerging area of application of these materials. In robotics and machines in general, SH materials and healing abilities have not yet been explored. This project will realize the scientifically ambitious and technologically concrete breakthroughs to exploit the combination of self-healing materials with (damage) sensing capabilities, intelligence and automated healing in soft robotics. This implies the design of anthropomorphic materials, capable of feeling pain. By intelligent control the inflicted damage will prompt the whole system to rest and heal before (more) serious damage occurs, restoring not only structural integrity by reattaching broken parts, but also restoring complex functions like sensing and actuation. To achieve this, dedicated SH materials will be synthesized and characterised, SH actuators and sensors will be created, and dedicated control intelligence for structural health monitoring and autonomous SH procedures will be investigated. All these technologies will be integrated in two demonstrators to disseminate the objectives.\"","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: MOSAIC - Evolution of the Ape Forelimb: Evidence from Internal Bone Structure Abstract: \"Understanding the locomotor behaviour of our Miocene ape ancestors is critical to reconstructing the evolution of walking on two feet, or bipedalism. The Miocene (20-5 million years ago (Ma)) epoch is crucial because it is during this period that the morphological features of living great apes, including humans, were defined. In this respect, Miocene apes show unique morphological combinations that are unlike any living primate, known as \"\"mosaic morphologies\"\", which include derived (ape-like) and primitive (generalised) features more suitable to provide a model from which bipedal fossil humans (hominins) \u2013 our direct ancestors \u2013 might have evolved. This project uses novel 3D methods (microCT scans and imaging sotfware) to conduct the first holistic analysis of the internal structure of Miocene ape forelimb bones. Bone remodels throughout life in response to load; variation in internal structure thus correlates with forelimb use and offers a more direct window into behaviour than external morphology alone. The bony joints of the forelimb on an array of extant Primate species, including apes and monkeys, will be analysed, shedding new light on Miocene ape locomotion, the evolution of living apes and the emergence of human bipedalism.\"","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The project includes two major European truck manufacturers (IVECO and VDL), who will build on existing small-scale prototyping activities to develop new zero-emission trucks tailored to the needs of European customers, mainly in large supermarket fleets. The vehicles will be standardised as far as possible to help encourage the development of the European supply chain. New high-capacity hydrogen refuelling stations will be installed to provide reliable, low carbon hydrogen supplies to the trucks. Most of the stations will be publicly accessible and this project will thus support the uptake of a broader range of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles.\nThe vehicles and infrastructure will be thoroughly tested via an extended trial with the high-profile end users over several years. The comprehensive data monitoring and analysis tasks will ensure that the technical, economic, and environmental performance of the hardware is assessed, and that the business case for further deployment of heavy-duty fuel cell trucks is developed. The scope and ambition of this innovative project will create a range of valuable information that will be disseminated widely amongst truck operators, representatives of the retail sector, policy makers, and the broader hydrogen industry.

{"text":"Title: SOLSTICE - Sodium-Zinc molten salt batteries for low-cost stationary storage Abstract: SOLSTICE answers the quest for stationary energy storage with two Na-Zn molten salt batteries, which operate at elevated temperature. The first concept benefits from the existing and successful ZEBRA\u00ae technology. Replacing their Ni-electrode by cheap and abundant Zn will only minimally affect other system parts thereby ensuring fast commercialisation. The second approach, an all-liquid cell, will apply the same chemistry, but does not require a ceramic electrolyte thus reducing cost further. Both battery concepts shall be brought to TRL5, and validated by four demonstrators, operating in a realistic environment at the end of the 4-year project. The demonstrators will be equipped with a self-learning battery management system and will be accompanied by upscaling, system integration and public acceptance studies. Na-Zn technology is exceptionally performant as it promises similar efficiency and depth of discharge as Li-ion cells, but extreme current densities. Featuring molten electrodes, Na-Zn cells actually work better when being cycled, as operation keeps them warm; several cycles per day and a lifetime exceeding 10,000 cycles can be legitimately expected. Na-Zn storage is perfectly sustainable: the raw materials, table salt and Zn, are abundant in the EU, cheap and not harmful. The environmental impact of Zn-mining and battery production is expected to be minimal. Finally, recycling is greatly simplified due to the large, molten electrodes. The most valuable element, Zn, can simply be recovered as pure metal and reused after dismantling the cells. Based on the existing knowledge on ZEBRA\u00ae battery production, the storage price of Na-Zn batteries is expected to approach 1 cent\/kWh\/cycle by 2030 - including balance-of-plant and recycling cost. Summing up, the Na-Zn technology is the cheapest molten-salt battery, is fully sustainable, fulfils all criteria of the call - and is even realistic to be commercialised by 2030.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

This might be particularly drastic when transmission changes from direct to vector-borne transmission, where prevalence and virulence are expected to increase. Despite its importance for disease control, we lack empirical and theoretical understanding of this process. The emergence of Varroa destructor in honeybees provides a unique opportunity to study how a novel vector affects pathogen ecology and evolution: this ectoparasitic mite is a novel vector for Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), a disease linked to severe increases in hive mortality. To study the fundamental evolutionary ecology of emerging vector-borne diseases, I will exploit a unique natural experiment, the presence of Varroa-free island refugia, to test how this novel vector affects epidemiology and evolution in the field. I will adapt cutting-edge single molecule sequencing to guide  controlled lab experiments by viral evolution in the wild, establishing novel reverse genetics approaches in DWV to test causal links between phenotypic and molecular evolution. Like all emerging diseases, DWV is a multi-host pathogen that also infects wild bee species not infested by Varroa, such as bumblebees. This raises an additional question, highly relevant for zoonotic diseases: does this specialist honeybee vector impact disease in wild bee populations? I will model the impact of vector acquisition and evolving pathogens on host populations and test potential prevention and mitigation strategies to safeguard these crucial pollinators. This system will not only provide fundamental insights into the evolutionary ecology of disease, but is also of immediate applied importance: bees are key pollinators of crops and wildflowers, and halting population declines facilitated by infectious disease is crucial for food security and biodiversity.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

In \"\"TissueTregs\"\" we identified and characterised a brain-resident regulatory T cell population, with high expression of anti-inflammatory and reparative proteins. A synthetic circuit for deliver IL2 to the brain expanded this population, without any off-target increases in circulation or the blood. In order to translate these findings beyond the scope of the original \"\"TissueTregs\"\" grant, we have moved to a viral vector system, designed to give brain-specific expression of IL2. This systems demonstrates long-lasting brain-specific expansion of the brain-resident regulatory T cell population, after only a single intravenous injection. Preliminary results demonstrate a striking ability of this treatment to prevent neurological damage in mouse models of traumatic brain injury and Multiple Sclerosis. A provisional patent has been filed to cover this invention. In this PoC grant, we will run the necessary validation and target deconvolution experiments to pave the way for this treatment to move into the clinical sphere.\"","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: my-AHA - My Active and Healthy Aging Abstract: Background\nWe propose a holistic view of interrelated frailties: cognitive decline, physical frailty, depression and anxiety, social isolation and poor sleep quality, which are a major burden to older adults and social and health care systems. Early detection and intervention are crucial in sustaining active and healthy ageing (AHA) and slowing or reversing further decline.\n\nAims and Relevance\nThe main aim of my-AHA is to reduce frailty risk by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, resulting in healthcare cost savings. my-AHA will use state-of-the-art analytical concepts to provide new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support.\n\nApproach\nAn ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via non-stigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected, my-AHA will provide targeted ICT-based interventions with a scientific evidence base of efficacy, including vetted offerings from established providers of medical and AHA support. These interventions will follow an integrated approach to motivate users to participate in exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with my-AHA.\n\nScale and Sustainability\nThe proposed platform provides numerous incentives to engage diverse stakeholders, constituting a sustainable ecosystem with empowered end users and reliable standardised interfaces for solutions providers, which will be ready for larger scale deployment at project end. The ultimate aim is to deliver significant innovation in the area of AHA by cooperation with European health care organizations, SMEs, NGOs.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean contains vast reserves of polymetallic nodules on the abyssal seafloor, a future source of deep-sea minerals already targeted for exploitation. There is an almost complete absence of open biodiversity data on the large animals (megafauna) of this 6 million km2 area, and it is a pressing conservation priority to establish baseline data to enable future sustainable management of the region. In particular, a regional-level assessment that cuts across contracted areas is urgently needed to [1] establish the baseline quantitative ecology of the region, [2] assess species richness and ranges and thus, [3] enable the successful management of this globally important marine area in the context of a global \u2018blue growth\u2019 agenda. The objective of this fellowship is to develop the first regional-level approach to megafauna classification and identification in the CCZ. This will be done using a three-fold approach: (1) The development of a new open-access data-archiving bioinformatic pipeline for imagery and samples of megafauna from the entire CCZ,  (2) the identification and characterization of megafaunal morphotypes observed across the CCZ regardless of exploration contract area and (3), development of biodiversity survey methods based on organismal DNA found in the environment (metabarcoding). This project will include knowledge transfers between the host and experienced researcher in the following areas: bioinformatics, digitisation, image analysis, megafauna taxonomy, DNA barcoding, metagenomics and transferable skills such as project management, scientific communication including science-policy interface work, laboratory health and safety, and career planning.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

To be both, applicable and competitive, the novel solution will have to respond to specific needs, namely:\n\n(1) high energy efficiency and density,\n(2) small size and low weight,\n(3) high reliability\n(4) compliance with existing standards and regulation, and\n(5) high cost-efficiency.\n\nAny energy storage system will have to first demonstrate its ability to store energy efficiently, within specific power, lifetime and safety specifications and eventually be available at a cost that is ultimately affordable by the nano\/microsatellite sector, which is highly cost-sensitive.\n\nWorldwide nanosatellite sector is continuously growing and three main aspects are driving the development: miniaturization, standardization and cost. However Europe has seriously fallen behind competitors from the US and Asia, with regard to R&D in the field of energy storage, which is one of the crucial components for improving and widening small satellites performance and applications.\n\nWith its approach, MONBASA is bridging the gap between R&D and market, with the desired future impact being that the provision of tailored energy solutions becomes a European discipline and business. By bringing together a cross-sector consortium that comprises actors from the areas of energy R&D, processing technologies and space applications, the exact needs of the space industry will be considered for innovative energy storage solutions at low TRL levels. This will not only significantly increase future market uptake of a novel solution that so far is in the state of basic research, but it will foster urgently needed intense knowledge exchange between non-space and space actors for jointly developing novel solutions for a field of expectedly strong growth.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: socSMCs - Socialising Sensori-Motor Contingencies Abstract: As robots become more omnipresent in our society, we are facing the challenge of making them more socially competent. However, in order to safely and meaningfully cooperate with humans, robots must be able to interact in ways that humans find intuitive and understandable. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach for understanding and modelling social behaviour and implementing social coupling in robots. Our approach presents a radical departure from the classical view of social cognition as mind-reading, mentalising or maintaining internal rep-resentations of other agents. This project is based on the view that even complex modes of social interaction are grounded in basic sensorimotor interaction patterns. SensoriMotor Contingencies (SMCs) are known to be highly relevant in cognition. Our key hypothesis is that learning and mastery of action-effect contingencies are also critical to enable effective coupling of agents in social contexts. We use \u201csocSMCs\u201d as a shorthand for such socially rele-vant action-effect contingencies. We will investigate socSMCs in human-human and human-robot social interaction scenarios. The main objectives of the project are to elaborate and investigate the concept of socSMCs in terms of information-theoretic and neurocomputational models, to deploy them in the control of humanoid robots (PR2, REEM-C) for social entrainment with humans, to elucidate the mechanisms for sustaining and exercising socSMCs in the human brain, to study their breakdown in patients with autism spectrum disorders, and to benchmark the socSMCs approach in several demonstrator scenarios. Our long term vision is to realize a new socially competent robot technology grounded in novel insights into mechanisms of functional and dysfunctional social behavior, and to test novel aspects and strategies for human-robot interaction and cooperation that can be applied in a multitude of assistive roles relying on highly compact computational solutions.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: Beauty2Charm - Precision tests of the Standard Model using Beauty to Charm decays Abstract: The present matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe cannot be explained by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. I propose to look for the presence of new physics beyond the SM in Charge-Parity (CP) asymmetries using beauty mesons decaying to charmed mesons (Beauty2Charm). A unique feature of these decays is that the SM contribution can be precisely measured using relations between ten decay modes all of which can be measured with in a coherent manner at a single experiment: LHCb at the Large Hadron Collier (LHC). The proposal will make measurements of ten branching ratios and eight analyses sensitive to CP violation using data collected by LHCb in order to test these relations. CP asymmetries larger than a few percent would be an unambiguous signal of the presence of new physics. In order to make these measurements at the required level of precision, I will lead a major upgrade to the way that the LHCb experiment selects proton proton collisions and for which I have laid the conceptual foundations. Real-Time Analysis  will enable a dramatic increase in the the efficiency and signal yield of the decay modes relevant to this proposal, and reduce systematic uncertainties. To test and commission this upgrade I will lead the first ever measurements of beauty hadron production using final states without leptons. The experience gained in the commissioning phase will result in increased efficiencies for the CP sensitive channels leading to the world's most precise measurements and world-leading sensitivity to new physics.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: HawkEye - Vision-based Guidance and Control in Birds, with Applications to Autonomous Unmanned Aircraft Abstract: Birds have been called \u201cune aile guide\u0301e par un oeil\u201d, and whilst they possess many senses besides vision, their wings are indeed guided largely by their eyes. Nevertheless, we know surprisingly little of how birds use vision to guide their flight, and almost nothing of the underlying guidance and control laws. This is an extraordinary omission, and unfortunate given the importance that vision is poised to assume in autonomous unmanned aircraft. With good reason, the law still requires a human eye to remain in the loop, but as with the coming revolution in driverless cars, the future of flight lies in autonomy. I see a once-in-a-career opportunity here: we need only imagine a hawk, shooting over the top of a hedgerow then plunging through the undergrowth onto its fleeting prey, to see what engineering could learn. Building upon the success of my ERC Starting Grant on Bird and Insect Flight Dynamics and Control, my proposed Consolidator Grant has two overarching ambitions: 1) to revolutionize our understanding of vision-based guidance and control in birds; and 2) to carry these insights over to application in unmanned autonomous aircraft. This presents a formidable technical challenge, but by combining a state-of-the-art motion capture suite with targets\/obstacles moving under motion control in a custom-built facility, I will use system identification techniques to unambiguously identify the guidance and control laws underpinning perching, pursuit, obstacle avoidance, and gap negotiation in birds. More than this, I will identify the precise motion cues to which they attend, settling longstanding questions on the extent to which guidance emerges from simple algorithmic rules versus state feedback and estimation, with wider implications for our understanding of avian perception. This work will break new ground in all directions, testing applied insights in the same facility, and so leading the world in drawing the study of birds and aircraft together under one roof.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: FashionBrain - Understanding Europe\u2019s Fashion Data Universe Abstract: The primary goal of each retailer is to \u201cunderstand your customers\u201d. Our interviews with retailers show a primary demand from the retail industry for predicting a customer's next demand. Surprisingly , even a complete record of past purchases (and returns) is not sufficient to understand how items in a company's catalog do or do not connect with the customer's general tastes, lifestyle and aspirations. Moverover, from a business perspective, any efficiency gains in the logistics of supplier management, shipping and handling are  rather minor, compared to the gains one could obtain from a better understanding of the customers\u2019 personalities and habits. Given that the customer demands trigger proactive stocking and fashion production, this appears as a logical consequence. \nIn this project, we want to consolidate and extend existing European technologies in the area of database management, data mining, machine learning, image processing, information retrieval, and crowdsourcing to strengthen the positions of European fashion retailers among their world-wide competitors. Our choice for the fashion sector is a concise one: i) as a multi-billion euro industry, the fashion sector is extremely important for the European economy; ii) Europe already has a solid position in the world fashion stage, however, to maintain its position and keep up with the competitors, European fashion industry needs the help of advanced technology; and iii) European fashion industry provides an excellent exercise for new technologies, because it is a multi-sectorial by itself (i.e., imposes challenging data integration issues), it has a short life-cycle (i.e., requires timely reaction to the current events) and it involves diverse languages and cultures.\nThe main outcome of the FashionBrain project is the improvement of the fashion industry value chain obtained thanks to the creation of novel on-line shopping experiences, the detection of influencers, and the prediction of upcoming fashion trends. Tangible outcomes will include software, demonstrators, and novel algorithms for a data-driven fashion industry.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: MICA - Mechanics of slow earthquake phenomena: an Integrated perspective from the Composition, geometry, And rheology of plate boundary faults Abstract: Major tectonic faults have, until recently, been thought to accommodate displacement by either continuous creep or episodic, damaging earthquakes. High-resolution geophysical networks have now detected \u2018slow earthquakes\u2019, transient modes of displacement that are faster than creep but slower than earthquakes. This project aims to illuminate the unknown mechanism behind slow earthquakes, through an integrated, multi-scale approach. MICA uses the unique natural laboratory of exhumed and active faults, to build numerical models constrained by observed fault geometry and microstructurally defined deformation mechanisms, to determine, for the first time, the rheology of slow slip.\n\nThe first objective is to create a model of the slow earthquake source, to constrain the micro- to kilometre-scale internal geometry of plate boundary faults, and the spatial distribution of deformation mechanisms. Fault rocks also retain a deformation sequence, allowing insight to how deformation style evolves with time. Thus, a combination of drill samples from active faults and outcrops of exhumed analogues, from a range of depths, allows for a 4-D model from micro- to plate boundary scale.\n\nBy knowing the geometrical distribution of fault rocks, and deciphering their evolution in time, this project will apply geologically constrained numerical models and laboratory constrained stress-strain relationships to determine bulk fault rheology as a function of space. Unique from past models, this project integrates scales from microstructures to plate boundary scale faults, and bases rheological models on deformation mechanisms and fault structures constrained through detailed fieldwork, and also considers the state-of-the-art of geophysical observation. The model focuses on understanding slow earthquakes, but also applies to understanding whether the slow earthquake source can also host fast seismic slip, and what differentiates slowly slipping faults from faults hosting major earthquakes.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: MUYA - The Multimedia Yasna Abstract: What exactly are the words which priests recite in the Yasna, the core ritual of one of the most ancient and influential living religions, Zoroastrianism? What is their meaning and how do they relate to the ritual actions? The Yasna is significant for our cultural heritage not only because of its influential thought system which arguably impacted on post-exilic Judaism, nascent Christianity and Islam, but also because with parts of it going back to the 2nd millennium BCE, it is the oldest witness to Iranian languages. Its full appreciation, however, is severely hampered by the presence of outdated editions and translations or by their absence altogether. Moreover, the relationship between the text recited and the action performed during the ritual is unexplored due to a lack of documentary evidence. The Multimedia Yasna proposes to fill these gaps in a methodologically ground-breaking fashion.\nMUYA combines two different, yet complementary approaches by examining the Yasna both as a ritual performance and as a text attested in manuscripts. The two approaches will be integrated to answer questions about the meaning and function of the Yasna in a historical perspective. The research methods for achieving MUYA\u2019s objectives unite cutting edge approaches from Digital Humanities, Philology and Linguistics into four interrelated work-packages. These will involve filming and analyzing the ritual performance and teaching practices in priestly schools, the creation of a suite of electronic tools for editing Avestan texts, a database of transcribed manuscripts of the Yasna and in-depth studies of selected parts of the text by combining datasets produced by electronic processes with philological methods of textual criticism and linguistic analysis. These complementary datasets and methods will be used to produce an online publication of the sub-titled and interactive film of the Yasna ritual, together with print editions, translations and commentaries of the Avestan Yasna.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: TheHiggsAndThe7Tops - Mirror Mirror on the Wall, which Higgs is the oddest of them all: Exploring the Top-Higgs Interconnection with ATLAS Abstract: With the ground-breaking discovery of a new scalar particle, the Higgs boson, in 2012 by ATLAS and CMS, the standard model (SM) of particle physics has been completed. Despite this success, many open questions on the fundamental laws of nature remain unanswered. Among these are how exactly particles acquire their mass and why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe.\n\nOne of the most promising avenues to approach these questions is to explore the relation between the Higgs boson and the heaviest known elementary particle: the top quark. Due to its large mass, the top is expected to play a special role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. In order to shed light onto this mechanism, understanding the coupling between the top and the Higgs in great detail and exploring the charge and parity (CP) nature of the Higgs are essential. While the SM Higgs boson is CP-even, many models beyond the SM require a CP-odd component. Higgs-top couplings are expected to provide an unambiguous probe of CP-mixed states.\n\nI will explore for the first time all processes in which a direct determination of the top-Higgs interconnection is feasible, in particular events where the Higgs is produced in association with 1, 2 and 4 top quarks. These are among the most challenging channels at the LHC. I will pioneer a comprehensive programme, consisting of the development of powerful event-reconstruction methods and improved boosting techniques, allowing the first exploitation of novel variables in a beyond-state-of-the-art cross-process analysis, thus unravel the CP-properties in the top-Higgs interaction.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is the precise direct measurement of the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling, and the first determination of the CP-nature of the Higgs boson in fermion interactions. Confronting these results with the SM and models that go beyond the SM will yield an unprecedented insight into the origin of mass of elementary particles.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: FiTTeR - Developing a Fibrosis Targeting and Tissue Reparative (FiTTeR) Therapy for the Infarcted Myocardium via an Injectable Functionalized Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel Abstract: As a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Fellow, I will develop, characterize, and determine the efficacy of a biomaterial platform to target pathologic fibrosis and promote tissue repair following myocardial infarction (MI). I have an ideal background and will perform well in this project based on my expertise in extracellular matrix (ECM) derived biomaterials, characterizing the immune response to biomaterials, and evaluating in vivo outcomes. The proposed system will consist of a protein fragment tethered to an injectable hydrogel. The hydrogel carrier will be composed of ECM, which has been shown to facilitate tissue repair processes by local modulation of immune cell phenotype . The cryptic protein fragment, recently isolated and recombinantly produced by the Stevens Group , has gained attention for its ability to regulate the onset of fibrosis by interfacing with cells to abrogate the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). No therapies currently exist to prevent or mitigate fibrosis. Developing a sophisticated delivery system for a cryptic protein fragment will enable the broad potential of targeting pathologic fibrosis to be realized. This system will be advantageous in simultaneously providing localized delivery, combined immunomodulatory and regulatory properties of the ECM and recombinant protein fragment, and sustained release of the protein fragment during degradation of the ECM hydrogel. The combination of my expertise (in ECM hydrogels, characterizing the host response to biomaterials, and translating technologies) and Prof Molly Stevens\u2019s supervision and world-class interdisciplinary biomaterials-focused group, the 2014 Research Group of the Year (European Life Science Awards), at Imperial College London (ICL), together make this project ideally suited for success.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: Tendon Therapy Train - Engineering in vitro microenvironments for translation of cell-based therapies for tendon repair Abstract: Tendon Therapy Train is a research, training and innovation programme for human and equine tendon repair and regeneration that will exploit recent advancements in tissue engineering by self-assembly (TESA) technologies which have led to the clinical translation and commercialisation of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs).  Although TESA therapies have the potential to revolutionise healthcare for numerous clinical targets, a lack of researchers with the necessary interdisciplinary skillset to advance the field is limiting clinical translation.  Tendon therapy train, a network of 8 beneficiaries and 8 partners (7 universities, 7 companies and 2 hospitals) from six countries across Europe, will train a cohort of 15 researchers to doctoral level in the interdisciplinary area of ATMPs.  The innovative credentials of the research and training programme involve engineering suitable ex vivo culture environments that, by mimicking the native tendon tissue milieu (human and equine), will maintain the tenogenic phenotype  of tendon derived cells and differentiate non-tendon derived cells (stem cells and dermal fibroblasts) towards the tenogenic lineage, subsequently enabling development of three-dimensional cell-assembled tissue equivalents, the clinical potential of which will be assessed in suitable preclinical models.  The comprehensive Tendon Therapy Train programme will equip researchers with transferable inter- and multidisciplinary skills that will further European-based knowledge, innovation, competitiveness and leadership in the field of TESA \/ ATMP and ultimately enable clinical translation and commercialisation of the developed technologies.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: 1D-Engine - 1D-electrons coupled to dissipation: a novel approach for understanding and engineering superconducting materials and devices Abstract: Correlated electrons are at the forefront of condensed matter theory. Interacting quasi-1D electrons have seen vast progress in analytical and numerical theory, and thus in fundamental understanding and quantitative prediction. Yet, in the 1D limit fluctuations preclude important technological use, particularly of superconductors. In contrast, high-Tc superconductors in 2D\/3D are not precluded by fluctuations, but lack a fundamental theory, making prediction and engineering of their properties, a major goal in physics, very difficult. This project aims to combine the advantages of both areas by making major progress in the theory of quasi-1D electrons coupled to an electron bath, in part building on recent breakthroughs (with the PIs extensive involvement) in simulating 1D and 2D electrons with parallelized density matrix renormalization group (pDMRG) numerics. Such theory will fundamentally advance the study of open electron systems, and show how to use 1D materials as elements of new superconducting (SC) devices and materials: 1) It will enable a new state of matter, 1D electrons with true SC order. Fluctuations from the electronic liquid, such as graphene, could also enable nanoscale wires to appear SC at high temperatures. 2) A new approach for the deliberate engineering of a high-Tc superconductor. In 1D, how electrons pair by repulsive interactions is understood and can be predicted. Stabilization by reservoir - formed by a parallel array of many such 1D systems - offers a superconductor for which all factors setting Tc are known and can be optimized. 3) Many existing superconductors with repulsive electron pairing, all presently not understood, can be cast as 1D electrons coupled to a bath. Developing chain-DMFT theory based on pDMRG will allow these materials SC properties to be simulated and understood for the first time. 4) The insights gained will be translated to 2D superconductors to study how they could be enhanced by contact with electronic liquids.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

This interdisciplinary approach will improve both the track super-structure and sub-structure designs, thus ensuring the whole system stiffness is optimised. To increase lifespan, advanced automatic irregularity correcting sleepers will be designed, that are synthetic and optimised for transition zones.

{"text":"Title: GSTHgNDD - Role of GST gene variation in susceptibility to mercury (Hg)-induced neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) in zebrafish Abstract: Environmental factors, including the heavy metal mercury, are recognized as having a dominant influence on the aetiology and prevalence of neurodevelopmental behavioural disorders. This proposal will develop a new model for assessing the role of gene:environment interactions, specifically genetic predisposition for toxicity, in risk for disease, and identify early markers predictive of toxicity and later phenotypes. This will directly relate to the EC work program for Health, demographic change and wellbeing, with respect to both 'Personalized medicine' for non-communicable diseases and 'Early development' addressing mental health from childhood to older ages. The project uses the zebrafish model to investigate the relationship between glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-related genetic background, developmental exposure to mercury, and risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. This will be achieved by exposure of wild-type and CRISPR-generated Gst mutant embryos to mercury, and testing whether genetic predisposition leads to increased risk for toxin-induced behavioural phenotypes. We will test for altered biochemical, transcriptomic and epigenomic modifications that may serve as potential early markers for insult. The results obtained in this proposal will have significant impact on the ability to conduct individual and population specific toxicity risk assessment, and may lead to novel measures for early detection of increased risk and alleviation of potential adverse outcomes. The high-quality original research presented in the proposal will not only enable the Experienced Researcher to reach a position of professional maturity in her career, but will also allow her to develop a spectrum of new and interdisciplinary skills, integrating her previous training and knowledge into the behavioural genetics skills set. This project will also allow Dr. Brennan's group to integrate developmental toxicology into existing behavioural research, and will generate new collaborations.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

To reinforce its pole position throughout the 21st century, Europe must be ready to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project by 2018\/19. This is one of the main recommendations of the updated European Strategy for Particle Physics, adopted by the CERN Council in May 2013.\nThe EuroCirCol conceptual design study is a direct response to this recommendation, initiating a study for a 100 TeV energy-frontier circular collider through a collaboration of institutes and universities worldwide.\n\nA new research infrastructure of such scale depends on the feasibility of key technologies pushed beyond current state of the art. Innovative designs for accelerator magnets to achieve high-quality fields up to 16 T and for a cryogenic beam vacuum system to cope with unprecedented synchrotron light power are required. The effects of colliding two 50 TeV beams must be mastered to meet the physics research requirements. Advanced energy efficiency, reliability and cost effectiveness are key factors to build and operate such an accelerator within realistic time scale and cost.\n\nThis proposal is part of the Future Circular Collider study under European leadership, federating resources worldwide to assess the merits of different post-LHC accelerator scenarios. It forms the core of a globally coordinated strategy of converging activities, involving participants from the ERA and beyond. Organisations joining this study from Japan and the USA are expected to take part in a global implementation project and a suitable governance model will be drawn-up accordingly.\n\nThe main outcome of EuroCirCol will be laying the foundation of subsequent infrastructure development actions that will strengthen the ERA as a focal point of global research cooperation and as a leader in frontier knowledge and technologies over the next decades.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The emotional aspects of an environment will be captured through the use of mobile EEG (Elecroencephalography) headsets, wearable bracelets\/watches, and other physiological sensors that will be embedded with a VR-headset, so as to allow capturing the neuro-feedback of a VR-experience. The neuro-feedback will allow the virtual space to be adapted accordingly, resulting in an emotion-adaptive space. The \u2018neuro-environments\u2019 will be used at two levels of granularity.

{"text":"Title: SpiraStent - DEVELOPMENT OF A SPIRAL LAMINAR FLOW INDUCING ENDOVASCULAR STENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE Abstract: The project is focused the medical device sector and specifically peripheral vascular (PV) devices. A large, unmet, and growing patient population will require treatment for Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and revenue in this market will continue to grow driven by the aging population and the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the most widely used non-surgical treatment, however when used in areas of long calcified stenosis, PTA does not show satisfactory results at long term follow up. Stenting has become the most obvious choice to overcome the limitations of PTA. Unfortunately, long term performance of stents appears to be problematic as they do not prevent (and may to a certain extent even cause) a failure mode known as restenosis. Whilst covered stents have tackled the problem of restenosis within the stent the stent itself interrupts the bloods natural spiral laminar flow (SLF) and increases laterally directed forces and wall shear stress downstream of the implantation causing downstream disease progression. Re-institution of the bloods SLF reduces the forces and turbulence caused by stenting, and reduces neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) distal to the stent which can lead to occlusion distal to the stent.\n\nThe global objective of the project is to develop an innovative endovascular stent that will reintroduce the natural spiral laminar flow both through the stent and distal to the stent that can be manufactured to be deployed using standard delivery system profiles. With the long term post project target of increasing patency rates to greater than 80% and reduce restenosis of the stent by greater than 20% and distal stenosis by greater than 20% at 2 year follow up. \n\nAs a result of the proposed project, we expect to improve our collective competitiveness and generate increased sales by capturing at least \u20ac25M p.a. of the European market for endovascular stents","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: QSB - Quantum Sensing for Biology Abstract: Modern physics has contributed to the development of powerful instruments and diagnostic tools for biology and medicine, with a direct impact on both our well-being and life expectancy. Today, it is timely to ask if the novel field of quantum information is ready to provide new methods for the life sciences. This proposal makes a step in this direction, introducing non-invasive quantum techniques for experimental biology, with potential applications to biomedical imaging. My goal is to show how quantum correlations (entanglement or discord) can be exploited to realize a fully non-invasive form of spectroscopy, which can be safely applied to fragile materials, such as photo-degradable biological samples (DNA\/RNA) or in-vivo human tissues. These objectives are not met in today\u2019s biology labs, where UV-light photometry heavily damages DNA\/RNA samples, or in public hospitals, where X-ray scans expose patients to significant radiation doses, with non-negligible risks of cancer. The basic rationale behind the use of quantum correlations relies on their superior capacity to detect small variations in the absorption properties of the materials, even when only a few photons are employed. By exploiting this remarkable feature, I will prove the possibility of non-invasive testing of biological samples. My central task will be the design of a practical model of a quantum-enhanced photometer which is fully based on continuous-variable systems. This design will involve the extension of quantum sensing and metrology to a more advanced double-box formulation where two channels, representing seeded and blank samples, are simultaneously probed. The realization of such a quantum-enhanced instrument would allow for real-time continuous measurements of organic molecules and nucleic acids without any photo-degradation.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

This entails examining the interface between the academy and the world of policymaking, i.e. common and intermediary structures between the two worlds enabling people, training and knowledge to travel between them. None of these areas has been subject to detailed study with regard to Russia. The objectives of the project therefore are: (1) to identify the major concepts, theoretical frameworks and empirical concerns that characterize the Russian study of Russia-EU relations; (2) to pinpoint the dominant narratives on Russia-EU relations produced by the policy world; (3) to identify the structures and frameworks of exchange, homology and mimetism between the academic and policy-making fields in Russia; (4) to identify the content and form of the actual exchange of knowledge and expertise between the academy and the field of policymaking. This close focus on Russia makes it essential for this study to be carried out under the Global Fellowship framework. The meeting of research objectives and the achievement of training goals require the development of ties and collaboration with the Russian academia and continued exposure to Russian policy-making environment.

These molecular complexes are called Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and represent a strong, valid alternative to current chemotherapies. Oncolinx\u2019s innovative linker\/payload technology enables the Azonafide platform to perform a sensitive discrimination between healthy and cancer cells, thereby avoiding adverse side-effects of chemotherapy. ADCs enhance the effectiveness of a systemic treatment and have the advantage of targeting only tumour sites within the same therapy.

In addition, Oncolinx\u2019s technology activates the immune system against the tumour, which is an integral hallmark of durable responses. Although Oncolinx\u2019s platform is designed to be adopted for drug-resistant breast cancers as first application, the Azonafide payload potency has been validated across all NCI-60 cell lines screening for different tumour types. The NCI-60 Human Tumour Cell Lines Screen also showed that the Azonafide payload, when conjugated with Oncolinx linker technology to specific antibodies, can kill up to 98.2% of cancer cells while remaining non-toxic to cells that do not express the antigen. NCI-60 screening has shown subnanomolar-picomolar potency across cancers  (1x10-9M). While a variety of ADCs compound are currently developed and tested, only two ADCs have been approved so far. However, because Azonafide platform has a unique mechanism of action, Oncolinx can exclusively target slow growing cancers, drug resistant cancers, and other cancers that cannot be treated by the technologies of the two competitors (Seattle Genetics and ImmunoGen).","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

It will establish who needs support, what kind and when. WP 2 examines (1) whether specific interventions, services and technology-based interventions (eHealth, social robots) could empower caregivers and reduce their burden, and if so, (2) how best to deliver these interventions, services (e.g. internet platforms) and tools to sustain willingness to care, experience optimal outcomes of their role, and improve quality of life amongst informal caregivers. Methods include experiments, factorial designs, and persuasive profiling. WP 3 examines the implementation and dissemination of innovative technology-based tools and interventions. The focus is on overcoming barriers following a user-centered, stakeholder-driven implementation and agile science approach to promote the adoption and implementation of innovative technologies to support informal caregivers. ENTWINE represents a stepping stone towards sustainable informal care throughout Europe.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: PROTEGO - Procedural Tools for Effective Governance (PROTEGO)  Patterns, Outcomes and Policy Design Procedural Tools for Effective Growth: Patterns, Outcomes and policy Design Abstract: PROTEGO arises out of a fundamental claim: procedural regulatory instruments have causal effects on the performance of political systems because they trigger accountability towards different stakeholders. The mix of policy instruments may be functional or dysfunctional, depending on how accountability mechanisms are combined. This project provides a theoretical rationale to capture the accountability effects by adopting an extension of delegation theory that considers multiple stakeholders. The theoretical framework will allow us to identify the key social mechanisms that make bureaucracies internalize the preferences of accountees. We will test the observable implications of the framework on outcomes that are crucial to the performance of political systems, such as trust in government, ease of business, control of corruption, sustainability. Empirically, we will collect, validate and analyze original data across the EU and its 28 Member States for the period 2000-2015, distinguishing between instruments that cover central departmental activity and independent regulatory agencies. The new dataset will cover administrative procedure acts, freedom of information, notice and comment, judicial review, impact assessment, environmental appraisal, and non-financial instruments for public spending accountability. These are the procedural instruments that enfranchise accountees. The bivariate relationship between a single instrument and outcomes explains little \u2013 because it\u2019s the overall ecology or mix of instruments that produces causal effects. These ecologies combine in different sequences and paths associated with the outcome. Hence we will draw on a suitable methodological approach - Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Causality and diffusion across time will be also explored via event-history analysis and principal component analysis. PROTEGO will contribute to theories of regulation and accountability, and provide a robust operational model of data and analysis.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: HypoTRAIN - Hyporheic Zone Processes \u2013 A training network for enhancing the understanding of complex physical, chemical and biological process interactions Abstract: Hyporheic zones (HZs) are key compartments for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. As dynamic and complex transition regions between rivers and aquifers, they are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple physical, biological and chemical processes. Turnover and degradation of nutrients and pollutants figure among the prominent ecological services the HZ provides. We are facing a significant knowledge gap in the understanding of how hyporheic processes are linked and how they impact on each other. This can be attributed to a lack of truly supra-disciplinary research and harmonized and innovative investigation methods.\n\nThe concept of HypoTRAIN has been tailored to fill this gap. Collaborative research with state-of-the art technologies from multiple disciplines (hydrology, ecology, microbiology, engineering, environmental physics, contaminant science, modelling) will generate new mechanistic insights into the functioning of HZs. A group of ESRs will be educated using the multi-faceted nature of HZs as the central theme of the training programme. The supra-disciplinary expertise within the network and the high-level training program will generate scientific knowledge that will set the ground for a more holistic design of river management plans and restoration measures. Research excellence as well as scientific and technological innovation is ensured as all partners have world-leading reputations and work at the forefront of their respective discipline areas.\n\nParticipating in HypoTRAIN will make ESRs highly attractive for employers and open up doors for their successful careers in research, regulation, consulting, and industry. They will be experts for the better assessment of the ecological and chemical status of surface waters and for providing successful river restoration and management strategies. The strong involvement of the non-academic sector will provide the ESRs with a holistic perspective on career opportunities.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: JUCLFUT - Towards a Just Climate Future? Urban sustainability, financialization, and the global housing crisis Abstract: Climate change is a complex problem that requires solutions that reach across the boundaries between local and global and economic and ecological spheres of policy and everyday life. The challenge of ensuring that the benefits and burdens of transitioning to a carbon neutral future are equitably distributed within and across communities is thus one of the most pressing currently facing humanity.  \nPensions have recently emerged as key actors in the pursuit of \u201cgreen\u201d investment, due to their fiduciary duties and the sensitivity of physical assets to political, regulatory and environmental effects of climate change (Government of Canada, 2018; Gold and Scotchmer, 2015; OPTrust, 2018; Mercer, 2018). At the same time, their involvement in the financialization of housing (e.g. turning housing into a pure commodity, severed from its social function as shelter) is exacerbating the global housing crisis, making it increasingly difficult for growing numbers of people to access their human rights to shelter (August, 2019; Farha, 2019; Parish, 2019b). Furthermore, even while COVID-19 has made the right to housing all the more urgent, the economic fallout from the pandemic is exacerbating the crisis as growing numbers of people are now at risk of mortgage default and eviction.  \nThis project therefore investigates the social effects of specific green housing projects financed by pension capital in order to assess the extent to which these investments are addressing climate objectives in a manner which also respects the internationally recognized human right to safe, adequate and affordable housing, and conforms to the imperative of a just transition, as defined by the EU as one which is \u201cinclusive for all\u201d and where \u201cno person or place is left behind\u201d.  \nThe central Research Question this project will answer is: What are the social and gendered effects of pension backed investments in green housing infrastructure on households and communities?","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: ChaperoneRegulome - ChaperoneRegulome: Understanding cell-type-specificity of chaperone regulation Abstract: Protein misfolding causes devastating health conditions such as neurodegeneration. Although the disease-causing protein is widely expressed, its misfolding occurs only in certain cell-types such as neurons. What governs the susceptibility of some tissues to misfolding is a fundamental question with biomedical relevance. \nMolecular chaperones help cellular proteins fold into their native conformation. Despite the generality of their function, chaperones are differentially expressed across various tissues. Moreover exposure to misfolding stress changes chaperone expression in a cell-type-dependent manner. Thus cell-type-specific regulation of chaperones is a major determinant of susceptibility to misfolding. The molecular mechanisms governing chaperone levels in different cell-types are not understood, forming the basis of this proposal. We will take a multidisciplinary approach to address two key questions: (1) How are chaperone levels co-ordinated with tissue-specific demands on protein folding? (2) How do different cell-types regulate chaperone genes when exposed to the same misfolding stress?\nCellular chaperone levels and their response to misfolding stress are both driven by transcriptional changes and influenced by chromatin. The proposed work will bring the conceptual, technological and computational advances of chromatin\/ transcription field to understand chaperone biology and misfolding diseases. Using in vivo mouse model and in vitro differentiation model, we will investigate molecular mechanisms that control chaperone levels in relevant tissues. Our work will provide insights into functional specialization of chaperones driven by tissue-specific folding demands. We will develop a novel and ambitious approach to assess protein-folding capacity in single cells moving the chaperone field beyond state-of-the-art. Thus by implementing genetic, computational and biochemical approaches, we aim to understand cell-type-specificity of chaperone regulation.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: EvolutioNeuroCircuit - Cellular and genetic bases of neural circuits evolution Abstract: Sensory systems encode the world around us to produce context-dependent appropriate behaviours. However, we know little about the way new sensory evoked behaviours arise as neural circuits are re-shaped during evolution. Tackling this question requires a deep understanding of the circuits underlying specific behaviours and integration of this knowledge with tools from other fields, including evolutionary and developmental biology. Recent technological advancements on neural circuit interrogation and genome editing have put progress on this fundamental biological question within reach. \nThe olfactory system of the larval stage of the fly Drosophila melanogaster and related species is an ideal model for investigating these questions because (i) D. melanogaster has pioneered both the fields of population genetics and neurogenetics and (ii) its olfactory system is one of the best-characterised neural circuits. We will address the question of how olfactory circuits evolve by studying four species with divergent odour-guided behaviours through the following multidisciplinary aims:\n1. Which olfactory pathways are targeted in the evolution of ecological specialisation? \u2013 Combining high-throughput behavioural assays, optogenetics and calcium imaging in the larva of all four species we will determine whether\/which olfactory pathways have switched valences or sensitivity.\n2. How have central neural circuits diverged? \u2013 We will address this question at unprecedented resolution through whole-brain calcium imaging and serial electron microscopy reconstruction.\n3. What are the molecular and genetic bases of neural circuits rewiring during evolution? \u2013 Using transcriptomic profiling we will identify differentially expressed genes in conserved and divergent circuits across species, and functionally probe selected candidates to establish causality.\n4.

{"text":"Title: OPTIMUM - Multi-source Big Data Fusion Driven Proactivity for Intelligent Mobility Abstract: Transportation sector undergoes a considerable transformation as it enters a new landscape where connectivity is seamless and mobility options and related business models are constantly increasing. Modern transportation systems and services have to mitigate problems emerging from complex mobility environments and intensive use of transport networks including excessive CO2 emissions, high congestion levels and reduced quality of life. Due to the saturation of most urban networks, innovative solutions to the above problems need to be underpinned by collecting, processing and broadcasting an abundance of data from various sensors, systems and service providers. Furthermore, such novel transport systems have to foresee situations in near real time and provide the means for proactive decisions, which in turn will deter problems before they even emerge. Our vision is to provide the required interoperability, adaptability and dynamicity in modern transport systems for a proactive and problem-free transportation system. OPTIMUM will establish a largely scalable, distributed architecture for the management and processing of multisource big-data, enabling continuous monitoring of transportation systems needs and proposing proactive decisions and actions in an (semi-) automatic way. OPTIMUM follows a cognitive approach based on the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act loop of the big data supply chain for continuous situational awareness. OPTIMUM's goals will be achieved by incorporating and advancing state of the art in transport and traffic modeling, travel behavior analysis, sentiment analysis, big data processing, predictive analysis and real-time event-based processing, persuasive technologies and proactive recommenders. The proposed solution will be deployed in real-life pilots in order to realise challenging use cases in the domains of proactive improvement of transport systems quality and efficiency, proactive charging for freight transport and Car2X communication integration.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

SoftSlide technology will positively impact the seal industry by providing around \u20ac3315 M\/year in energy savings for hydraulic and pneumatic end-users. \nEnergy losses caused by friction within dynamic seals in rotating, moving and reciprocating devices (e.g. motors, valves, air compressors, accumulators...) represent up to 25% of total energy consumption. In addition, dynamic seals related friction, damages the seal surface overtime, thus reducing its lifetime. Although, it is of common knowledge that low-friction dynamic seals can be obtained by specifically designing and engraving micro-patterns on the seal contact area (area in contact with the moving mechanism), current seals' mass production processes do not incorporate this crucial step. To get a low-friction dynamic seal, the micro-pattern needs to be individually engraved, seal by seal at an independent later stage, once the seal has been produced. This greatly increases the cost and limits the productivity of low-friction dynamic seals being impossible for end-users to include these in their systems. SoftSlide project has created a mass production process that transfers micro-patterns during moulding stage to obtain low-friction, high performing dynamic seals. This process can be easily adopted by dynamic seals manufacturers seals with an insignificant cost increase.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: Aftermath - THE AFTERMATH OF THE EAST ASIAN WAR OF 1592-1598. Abstract: Aftermath seeks to understand the legacy of the East Asian War of 1592-1598. This conflict involved over 500,000 combatants from Japan, China, and Korea; up to 100,000 Korean civilians were abducted to Japan. The war caused momentous demographic upheaval and widespread destruction, but also had long-lasting cultural impact as a result of the removal to Japan of Korean technology and skilled labourers. The conflict and its aftermath bear striking parallels to events in East Asia during World War 2, and memories of the 16th century war remain deeply resonant in the region. However, the war and its immediate aftermath are also significant because they occurred at the juncture of periods often characterized as \u201cmedieval\u201d and \u201cearly modern\u201d in the East Asian case. What were the implications for the social, economic, and cultural contours of early modern East Asia? What can this conflict tell us about war \u201caftermath\u201d across historical periods and about such periodization itself? There is little Western scholarship on the war and few studies in any language cross linguistic, disciplinary, and national boundaries to achieve a regional perspective that reflects the interconnected history of East Asia. Aftermath will radically alter our understanding of the region\u2019s history by providing the first analysis of the state of East Asia as a result of the war. The focus will be on the period up to the middle of the 17th century, but not precluding ongoing effects. The team, with expertise covering Japan, Korea, and China, will investigate three themes: the movement of people and demographic change, the impact on the natural environment, and technological diffusion. The project will be the first large scale investigation to use Japanese, Korean, and Chinese sources to understand the war\u2019s aftermath. It will broaden understandings of the early modern world, and push the boundaries of war legacy studies by exploring the meanings of \u201caftermath\u201d in the early modern East Asian context.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: IILSCFLP - The Influence of Ionic Liquid Solvation on the Chemistry of Frustrated Lewis Pairs Abstract: Hydrogen (H2) is an important reagent for the chemical industry as well as representing a promising carbon-free fuel source when made from renewable sources. H2 needs to be activated for these applications, generally using rare, expensive and often toxic transition metal catalysts. Metal-free H2 activation has recently been demonstrated using the concept of \u2018frustrated Lewis pairs\u2019 (FLPs) based on main group elements such as phosphorous and boron rather than transition metals. FLPs are somewhat limited in scope due to the highly reactive Lewis acids (LAs) and bases (LBs) required for H2 activation which can lead to side reactions with substrates and solvents. The use of less reactive FLPs is restricted by the H2 activation step. This project addresses this problem by using the unique solvating ability of ionic liquids (ILs) to control the reactivity of FLPs for H2 activation. Many FLPs form ions when they react with H2. To promote H2 activation, it is essential that the reverse reaction (ion recombination to form H2) is prevented. The high ion dissociation power of ILs should prevent the recombination of these ions, leading to more efficient H2 activation. The impact of ILs on H2 activation by FLPs will be investigated in the context of synthesis and fuel cell applications. Successful use of ILs for this purpose would substantially increase the scope of FLP catalysts, reducing the reliance on transition metals thereby decreasing the potential cost and environmental impact of H2 activation processes. This project would represent the first study on the effect of ILs on FLP reactivity and combines the collective expertise of Prof. Welton (ILs) and Dr Ashley (FLPs) at Imperial College (IC) with the applicant\u2019s background in ILs, kinetics and intermolecular interactions, while providing the applicant with productive collaborative partners and advanced training in catalysis, electrochemistry, IL and FLP chemistry to propel him towards an independent research career.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

AgriChemWhey will build a first-of-a-kind, industrial-scale biorefinery with integrated symbiotic industrial and agricultural value chains that will valorise over 25,000 tonnes (100% dry matter) per annum of excess WP and DLP to several added value products for growing global markets including lactic acid, polylactic acid, minerals for human nutrition and bio-based fertilisers. This will be achieved through a coordinated investment process and development path to realise the Flagship plant, representing the first major industrial venture to convert residues from food processing, as second generation feedstocks, to value added bio-based products. The Flagship will prove the techno-economic viability of the innovative WP\/DLP-to-lactic acid biorefinery technology and will establish a new value chain for industrial symbiosis with other local actors for the production of high value sustainable food and feed (including high quality mushrooms) products from other side streams, as an enhanced circular bioeconomy approach to agriculture and agri-food waste. This offers society and industry the opportunity for greater resource efficiency - less food waste, more products from the same starting material (milk), and integration of food and non-food material production.

Typically, they account for 20-30% of the total primary energy requirement of industrialized countries, 40% in EU. Applying the proposed integrated RES to buildings is an important application for wider integration and deployment of renewable energy and to achieving our binding EU targets of at least a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030, compared to 1990 and at least 27% of renewable energy in EU.   The IDEAS project will create an innovative building integrated renewable energy system (RES) which will cost effectively exceed current RES efficiencies, generating electricity, heat and cooling and optimised for multifamily, public and commercial buildings in different climatic conditions.  The research aim is to create a novel low-cost building integrated RES maximizing the output tuneable for different climatic conditions through novel luminescent and geometric concentrator techniques leading to current solar system efficiencies being exceeded electrically.  Thermally enhancement will be achieved using enhanced organic phase change materials (PCM) with a passive biomimetic heat transfer mechanism for heat storage and discharge. An electrically driven multi-source heat pumpHP system will then use the main energy sources at building scale (waste heat from the system, air and ground), to provide the input to an integrated underfloor heating and hot water system, and to manage the thermal energy storage.

During this period, state-level political systems developed and there was a massive expansion of urban settlement into the arid Syrian steppe. Scholars at Durham have proposed that elite exploitation of the economic opportunities provided by the humble sheep for the development of a vast new livestock-based economy lay at the heart of this transformation, representing a fundamental shift in socio-political networks, economic resilience and risk management strategies. Although material culture and texts provide clear indications about the vital significance of the wool industry in these major socio-economic changes, the proposed research will provide the first reliable means of directly testing these hypotheses by using multi-element isotopic analysis of archaeological animal enamel and bone to examine changes in animal management and herding strategies in Syria-Palestine in the 4th-2nd millennia BC.

Tackling this grand challenge requires enhanced coordination of national efforts to accelerate discovery. Such synergies have been created among 28 countries in the pilot EU JPI on Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND). JPND has a long standing experience in collaborative action with \u20ac75 million of additional national funds being successfully mobilized between 2011 and 2014 to support transnational research programs. The JPND Research Strategy is now ripe for further enhancement in tight coordination with the EC through an ERA-Net Cofund instrument JPco-fuND with an unprecedented commitment of \u20ac30 million of national funds associated to a highly incentivizing EC top-up fund. \nAmong the most burning questions, three priority topics have emerged through a consultative process between researchers and JPND members in order to unlock several major issues within ND research: the identification of genetic, epigenetic and environmental risk and protective factors, the development and maintenance of longitudinal cohorts, the creation of advanced experimental models. These are key questions of equal priority to increase understanding of ND mechanisms that will be addressed through a common joint transnational call allowing a significant acceleration of the execution of the JPND research strategy. Moreover, to expand the impact of JPco-fuND, JPND will continue to implement other actions without EU co-funding such as aligning national research strategies, making databases more accessible and interoperable, developing enabling capacities such as supportive infrastructure and platforms, capacity building, education and training.

Proof of concept prototypes (up to TRL5) will be developed that incorporate a brand new Si on SiC substrate solution into state-of-the-art power electronic device architectures. The resulting power devices will be capable of working at voltage ratings from 50 to 600 V, in high radiation conditions and at temperatures up to 300\u00b0C, characteristics unavailable in the current power market, let alone for Space. By solving the so-called self-heating effect of state-of-the-art silicon-on-insulator electronics, this disruptive technology will offer: 1) significantly improved device efficiency with at least 50% less wasted power; 2) three times the power density; 3) a significant increase in the maximum operating temperature, by as much as 100\u00b0C and 4) a radiation tolerance to match the current state-of-the-art. These characteristics translate into a more efficient power system to boost on-board power and waste less heat. This reduces the burden on the cooling system saving mass and space on the spacecraft, and increasing mission length. Therefore, this is a technology enabling or benefitting several space technologies including high voltage solar arrays, electric propulsion, and many ancillary power conditioning applications.

Rapid political, economic and institutional transformations have triggered the reshuffling of housing. Within this framework, transnational investors are entering local property markets, purchasing repossessed houses and\/ or non-performing loans. Spain and Greece, and their major cities Barcelona and Athens, are two outstanding but contrasting examples of this socio-political and spatial restructuring.

As a comparative general social survey the ESS needs to have generous national coverage to provide analytical power and ensure it keeps up with the changing scientific and research infrastructure landscape. Failure in one or more of these areas could damage or even destroy the infrastructure. This grant will substantially reduce the risk by securing the medium-term sustainability of the infrastructure and making it more resilient towards future challenges. The ESS has responded effectively to the ESFRI approach since it became an ERIC in 2013 and receives sizeable financial contributions from its members for core activities.\n\nESS-SUSTAIN-2 aims to build on that support and creates sustainability through a structural strengthening of the ESS and by future proofing the infrastructure. ESS is not seeking another few years Commission funding to keep it afloat, an approach unlikely to yield long-term sustainability (and in any event these costs are now met by ERIC members). Rather it seeks a vital helping hand to help complete the transition of the ESS into a research infrastructure that is financially sound and scientifically equipped for the future.

However, the observations are challenging because the signal is often embedded in instrumental and telescope systematic noise. In the ExoplANETS_A project, we will develop novel data calibration and spectral extraction tools, as well as novel retrieval tools, based on 3D models of exoplanet atmospheres, to exploit archival data from ESA Space Science archives (HST) combined with NASA Space Archives (Spitzer, Kepler) and produce a homogeneous and reliable characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, to model successfully the atmosphere of an exoplanet, it is necessary to have a sound knowledge of the host star. To this end, we will collect a coherent and uniform database of the relevant properties of host stars from ESA Space Science archives (XMM, Gaia), combined with international space mission and ground-based data. These exoplanet and host star catalogues will be accompanied\/interpreted with models to assess the importance of star \u2013 planet interactions. The knowledge gained from this project will be disseminated through peer-review publications and modelling tools will be publicly released.\nIn addition to the delivery of high level data products, state of the art tools, models and scientific publications, the project the project will ready us to rapidly exploit data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which is a highly competitive.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: ACORN - Nanoparticle-Based Therapeutic Applications and Detection of Carbon Monoxide Releasing Molecules Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) has gathered increasing attention because of its role as a gasotransmitter with therapeutic and cell-protective effects. It is also recognised as a cell-signalling molecule where recent developments in the area of CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) and materials for controlled CO application have shown their importance with respect to delivery of such agents to their respective targets. However, despite their promise, their remains two major bottlenecks that may prevent these compounds from reaching the clinic. Firstly, the precise spatial-temporal CO release of CORMs is not target-specific. The CO molecule is highly diffusive and binds to haemoproteins, which are ubiquitous. Secondly, CORMs are made of metal carbonyl complexes and as organometallic compounds, there is the potential of heavy metal toxicity. Moreover, since CORMs are water-soluble they are distributed throughout the body, which can lead to further increased toxicities against healthy tissues. Our project aims to alleviate some of the problems of CORMs by a) developing a method to monitor CO release by MRI and optical imaging; b) reformulate CORMs by encapsulating inside nanomaterials (specifically the FDA approved PLGA as a nanocarrier) and c) provide targeting of the CORMs to their site of delivery by conjugating peptide targeting moieties to the surface of the PLGA nanoparticle. Through the completion of these activities, I;;, supported by its twinning partners, is in the best position to achieve an improved capability to compete for internationally competitive research funding and to access business stakeholders. By claiming its position in research and innovation networks IMM will effectively contribute to research excellence and value creation in health at European level.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: STARCELL - Advanced strategies for substitution of critical raw materials in photovoltaics Abstract: STARCELL proposes the substitution of CRM\u2019s in thin film PV by the development and demonstration of a cost effective solution based on kesterite CZTS (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) materials. Kesterites are only formed by elements abundant in the earth crust with low toxicity offering a secure supply chain and minimizing recycling costs and risks, and are compatible with massive sustainable deployment of electricity production at TeraWatt levels. Optimisation of the kesterite bulk properties together with redesign and optimization of the device interfaces and the cell architecture will be developed for the achievement of a challenging increase in the device efficiency up to 18% at cell level and targeting 16% efficiency at mini-module level, in line with the efficiency targets established at the SET Plan for 2020. These efficiencies will allow initiating the transfer of kesterite based processes to pre-industrial stages. These innovations will give to STARCELL the opportunity to demonstrate CRM free thin film PV devices with manufacturing costs \u2264 0.30 \u20ac\/Wp, making first detailed studies on the stability and durability of the kesterite devices under accelerated test analysis conditions and developing suitable recycling processes for efficient re-use of material waste. The project will join for the first time the 3 leading research teams that have achieved the highest efficiencies for kesterite in Europe (EMPA, IMRA and IREC) together with the group of the world record holder David Mitzi (Duke University) and NREL (a reference research centre in renewable energies worldwide) in USA, and AIST (the most renewed Japanese research centre in Energy and Environment) in Japan. These groups have during the last years specialised in different aspects of the solar cell optimisation and build the forefront of kesterite research. The synergies of their joined efforts will allow raising the efficiency of kesterite solar cells and mini-modules to values never attained for this technology.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: DC Metabolism - Metabolic Regulation of Conventional Dendritic Cell Development and Function Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in directing innate and adaptive immune responses against infections and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that control DC development and function may reveal new ways to alter the course of complex human diseases such as cancer. Despite their importance in immunity, some open questions remain in regards to DC basic biology. Two of these questions, in particular, are the subject of this application: 1) DCs are a heterogenous population, which can be subdivided into conventional DC type 1 (cDC1) and 2 (cDC2) subsets. Although their development depends on distinct transcriptional programs, cDC1 and cDC2 descend from a common precursor under the influence of the same growth factor cytokine. What determines cDC1\/2 differentiation? 2) Various loss-of-function studies demonstrate that cDC1 are key antigen-presenting cells for initiating CD8+ T cell responses to tumours and some viruses. This primarily relies on a process termed cross-presentation. How is cross-presentation regulated in cDC1? Recent studies indicate that profound changes in cellular metabolism are coupled to immune cell function and may fundamentally underpin cell-fate decisions. Based on previous observations and our own preliminary data, we hypothesise that glycolysis programs cDC1 development and activation, whereas fatty acid metabolism controls the ability of the same cells to cross-present antigens to CD8+ T cells. We propose to define the metabolic programs that drive DC formation and that underlie cDC1 and cDC2 identity and complement this approach with loss and gain-of-function experiments that will allow specific testing of our hypotheses. Globally, these studies will identify novel mechanisms of immune cell control with implications for antiviral and anticancer immunity.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

This program is seen as having the potential to create a second, China-led internet, which splits from the US-centered one and is ruled by a different set of priorities and values. Are the Digital Silk Road and the global expansion of Chinese tech companies prefiguring a future with two internets: an existing one that is US-led and founded on market-driven ideology, and a new, alternative one that is China-led and characterized by state control, national boundaries, and national governance over what began as a borderless new space? What values and politics are built into the various components of the Digital Silk Road, and is - or how is - the internet they are creating fundamentally different from the current one? \n\nThe project will employ qualitative and ethnographic methods, digital methods, and document analysis to understand the emergence of the Digital Silk Road from the ground-up and from the comparative perspective of business, governments, and ordinary people in four countries: China, where Digital Silk Road policies, finances, devices, online platforms and apps originate; Kazakhstan, a key player in Central Asia; Myanmar, whose economic dependence on China is the cause of considerable ambivalence; and Cambodia, that under Prime Minister Hun Sen has been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Chinese investments.\n\nThe project aims at illuminating the deployment of the Digital Silk Road to see what this second internet might consist of; seeks to understand what values and politics are embedded in it; and explores how they are received and negotiated in the countries concerned, thus contributing to the wider debate on values, ethics, and technology.","gt":false,"conf":0.6}
{"text":"Title: MicroC - Agent-Based Modelling of Gene Networks to model clonal selection in the tumour microenvironment and predict therapeutic resistance Abstract: The occurrence of therapeutic resistance is a major cause for the small effect on overall survival showed by targeted cancer therapies. Whilst experimental strategies to evaluate available treatments have been faced by an ever increasing number of possible combinations, computational approaches have been challenged by the lack of a framework able to model the multiple interactions encompassed by the three major factors affecting therapeutic resistance: selection of resistant clones, adaptability of gene signalling networks, and a protective and hypoxic tumour microenvironment.\n\nHere I propose a novel modelling framework, Agent-Based Modelling of Gene Networks, which brings together powerful computational modelling techniques and gene networks. This combination allows biological hypotheses to be tested in a controlled stepwise fashion, and it lends itself naturally to model a heterogeneous population of cells acting and evolving in a dynamic microenvironment, which is needed to predict therapeutic resistance and guide effective treatment selection.\n\nUsing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a testing case (15% of breast cancers, lacks validated), I propose to: \n\n1. Develop a computational model of the TNBC tumour microenvironment using in-vitro and in-vivo, including patient-derived, models and data from clinical samples. 2. Validate the ability of the model to predict driver genes conferring a survival advantage to cancer cells in a hypoxic microenvironment. 3. Predict combinations of druggable targets to tackle TNBC therapeutic resistance. 4. Select most effective drug combinations and validate pre-clinically.\n\nThis project will deliver pre-clinically validated drug combinations, new therapeutic targets and a virtual environment to study individual tumours and predict therapeutic resistance. Complementing and empowering experimental models and assays, microC will offer a new powerful tool for diagnosis and therapy.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: FICTSTRUCT - Fictionalist Mathematical Structuralism Abstract: \"Mathematics is ubiquitous throughout the sciences and in everyday language and thought. Its applications across all disciplines - science, economics, engineering, computing and more - are central to the future development of a robust, creative, and driven society. The abstract character of mathematics raises difficult philosophical questions about the nature of mathematical entities (such as numbers, functions, and sets), how we have knowledge of such entities, and how they can be applied in the real world. This research project tackles such questions by integrating two perspectives in the philosophy of mathematics, viz. \"\"mathematical structuralism\"\" and \"\"mathematical fictionalism\"\". Both structuralism and fictionalism capture important aspects of how many working mathematicians approach their practice. But in contemporary philosophy of mathematics, structuralism and fictionalism are widely thought of as presenting competing views of the nature of mathematics. In contrast, this project will develop a new theory of mathematical structure that unifies structuralism and fictionalism, thereby shifting the debate and promoting new and fruitful lines of research in the philosophy of mathematics and mathematical practice. Crucially, this research will be informed and supported by interdisciplinary discussions of mathematical practice with mathematicians, mathematical scientists, linguists who work on meaning and reference, and psychologists whose research focuses on mathematical cognition. Drawing on aspects of their research, this project will build a new and distinctive positive theory of the nature of mathematics. With this comprehensive theory established, the project will show how it can be deployed to make progress on long-standing problems in the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science.\"","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: MuSeq - Defining the Oligodendrocyte Lineage in Multiple Sclerosis Lesions by Single Cell RNA-Sequencing Abstract: At which stage in oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation does remyelination in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions fail? Answering this is essential for developing new therapies for progressive MS patients in whom failed remyelination leads to neurodegeneration. Current neuropathological technologies using antibody labelling are insufficiently sensitive to detect each of the possible stages at which the process might fail. In MuSeq, I will therefore use single cell and single nuclear RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) technologies to define the stages of OL differentiation in human post-mortem brain in healthy and in MS tissue available to me from the Edinburgh tissue bank. By overcoming the problems of sensitivity and revealing the degree of heterogeneity within lesions, this innovative and multidisciplinary project will for the first time unravel the patterns of OL differentiation and its failure in human MS lesions. This in turn will generate a new and powerful classification system for MS lesions based on their regenerative potential, and generate an open-access web database for future functional studies beyond this project and laboratory. By identifying those key roadblocks that need to be overcome to promote remyelination, MuSeq will lay the foundations for rational therapeutics to improve the repair mechanisms of individual MS patients and thus promote European scientific excellence. The project will be carried out under the guidance of leading experts at the University of Edinburgh with a secondment at the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm), a world-leading medical research institution. Results from the project will be used to raise public awareness on the importance of innovative MS research. I have the track-record, expertise and motivation to drive this IF project, and this will equip me with the extra skills I need to pave the way for my future career as an independent researcher in the field of translational neuroscience in Europe and internationally.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The HARVESTORE project aims to power these IoT nodes from ubiquitous heat and light sources by using nano-enabled micro-energy systems with a footprint below 1cm3. Using disruptive concepts from the emerging Nanoionics and Iontronics disciplines, which deal with the complex interplay between electrons and ions in the nanoscale, a radically new family of all-solid state micro-energy sources able to harvest and store energy at the same time will be developed. This new devices will be called \u201c\u03bc-harvestorers\u201d (\u03bcHS).

{"text":"Title: CHROMPART - Partition calculus on graphs, digraphs and hypergraphs with uncountable chromatic number Abstract: Our main goal is to develop the theory of partition calculus on graphs, digraphs and hypergraphs with emphasis on interactions between one-and multi-dimensional relations. Such global characteristics crucially depend on local, often finitary structural properties. This places our project at the meeting point of finite and infinite combinatorics with logic and set theory.  Some of the most important questions that motivate our investigations were first raised by P. Erd\u0151s and A. Hajnal in the 1960s. Their problems still guide research across finite and infinite combinatorics including the most recent works of R. Diestel, N. Hindman, P. Komj\u00e1th, C. Thomassen, S. Todorcevic, and S. Shelah.    Our main objective is to investigate ramification arguments between Ramsey-results of varying dimensions. In fact, (1) we study if graphs with uncountable chromatic number necessarily satisfy the same higher-dimensional negative partition relations as uncountable complete graphs.  We relate this theme to (2) the existence of orientations with large dichromatic number and partition relations on digraphs. Lastly, we explore a novel concept, (3) the existence of oscillation maps on the obligatory hypergraph associated to a graph with uncountable chromatic number.  Our program will be carried out through solving specific, often well-known open problems that are central to these themes. We aim to study both the purely combinatorial and the deep foundational issues that underlie these questions.  Hence, we will complement the use of advanced forcing techniques from set theory (such as mixed side-condition methods and new iteration preservation theorems) with novel combinatorial tools, such as minimal walks, oscillation maps and various ZFC construction scheme techniques. We expect our research to produce new methods of wide impact and a significantly deeper understanding of the interactions of finite and infinitary combinatorics.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: BacterialCORE - Widespread Bacterial CORE Complex Executes Intra- and Inter-Kingdom  Cytoplasmic Molecular Trade Abstract: The enormous versatility of bacteria enables the formation of multi-species communities that colonize nearly every niche on earth, making them the dominant life form and a major component of the biomass. Exchange of molecular information among neighboring bacteria in such communities, as well as between bacteria and proximal eukaryotic cells, is key for bacterial success. Yet, the principles controlling these multicellular interactions are poorly defined. Here we describe the identification of a bacterial protein complex, herein termed CORE, whose function is to traffic cytoplasmic molecules among different bacterial species, and between pathogenic bacteria and their human host cells. The CORE is composed of five membrane proteins, highly conserved across the entire bacterial kingdom, providing a ubiquitous platform that facilitates both intra- and inter-kingdom crosstalk. Our preliminary data support the idea that the CORE acts as a shared module for the assembly of larger apparatuses, executing this universal molecular flow among organisms. We propose to elucidate components, structure and biogenesis of the CORE machinery, operating during bacteria-bacteria and pathogen-host interactions. We further aim to provide an unbiased-global view of the extent and identity of cytoplasmic molecules traded via CORE including metabolites, proteins and RNA, and to reveal the criteria determining the specificity of the transported cargo. Furthermore, we intend to decipher the impact of CORE-mediated molecular exchange on bacterial physiology and virulence, and devise anti-CORE compounds to combat pathogenic bacteria. This study is expected to transform the way we currently view bacterial communities and host-pathogen interactions. We anticipate these findings to lead to the development of creative strategies to modulate, predict and even design bacterial communities, and lay the foundation for new and innovative approaches to fight bacterial diseases.\n\n\n\u2003","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: FOROIL - Objective-based forecast evaluations for crude oil volatility. Abstract: Oil price volatility forecasting is of major importance due to the financialisation of the oil market and the fact that the oil market participants\u2019 decisions are based on such forecasting (e.g. oil-intensive industries, policy makers, portfolio traders, etc). Currently, forecasters predict oil price volatility using GARCH and HAR models and evaluate the performance of these models using statistical loss-functions, such as the Mean Absolute Predictive Error. Even more, the literature concentrates mainly its attention on two measures of volatility, namely the conditional volatility and the realized volatility. \nNevertheless, oil price volatility users are faced with multiple volatility measures, multiple forecasting models and different reasons for which they use oil price volatility forecasts (e.g. policy making, portfolio allocation, risk management). Thus, in order for oil volatility users to make informed decisions, they need to know what the most appropriate volatility measure is and what the most accurate forecasting model is.\nThis innovative project aims to lay the foundations for an advanced econometric model framework for the evaluation of the best oil volatility measures along with the best forecasting models, using objective-based loss functions.  \nThe outcome of this fellowship will be a toolbox, containing the aforementioned framework. The project will have a great impact on the fellow as it will allow him to advance his existing scientific skills through the cutting-edge training in the state-of-the-art oil volatility forecasting techniques, in energy finance and in the field of consulting.

While populism is a phenomenon that has by now emerged in almost every democracy, we believe that regional and cultural-historical dimensions need to be considered in order to improve not only scholarly knowledge, but also policy recommendations. It is urgent for Western Europeans to look into the CEE mirror, just as it is urgent for the CEE region to understand itself.

{"text":"Title: Relieve-Chol - Reprogramming cell identity to develop new therapies against Cholangiopathies Abstract: Intra- hepatic Cholangiocytes represent one of the main cell type of the liver with hepatocytes. They line the biliary tract and fulfill essential functions such as bile modification and transport. Cholangiocytes are targeted by a diversity of diseases including genetic disorders such as Cystic Fibrosis. There is currently no cure for disorders affecting cholangiocytes and end stage disease require liver transplantation. Importantly, primary cholangiocytes obtained from biopsy can not be grown in vitro without loosing their functional characteristics while transformed cells and animal models rarely recapitulate the entire pathophysiology of human diseases. Consequently, the development of novel drug and therapies remains problematic despite an urgent clinical need. Human induced pluripotent stem cells could provide an advantageous solution to bypass this major challenge. Indeed, these pluripotent stem cells are generated by direct reprograming of somatic cells and they can proliferate almost indefinitely in vitro while maintaining their capacity to differentiate into almost any cell types. Interestingly, hIPSC can be derived from patients with genetic disorders and then differentiated into the relevant cell types for disease modeling purposes. Of direct interest, we recently developed a protocol to generate cholangiocytes from hIPSCs using chemically define conditions. The resulting cells display functional characteristics of their in vivo counterpart including the capacity to transport bile acid. Here, we propose to enable our culture system for the production of  large quantity of hIPSCs derived cholangiocytes in conditions compatible with the pharmaceutical industry requirements. The resulting cells will be then fully characterized to validate their relevance for modeling Cystic fibrosis and for testing small molecules. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to create a novel drug screening platform for the discovery of therapeutics targeting genetic form of cholangiopathies.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

It explores the framing and development of entitlements to childcare-related leaves and services, the drivers of the reforms and their outcomes. It is particularly interested in (1) reform potential of the European social investment agenda to affect a redistributive dynamic in childcare and (2) parenting practices of those parents who appear to be redistributive losers of the European social investment agenda (e.g. parents with short-time contracts, unemployed). The data analysed will include national legislation and policy documents and information obtained through expert interviews and interviews with\nparents. The project tackles the innovative and important topic of social inequalities in childcare, seeking to enhance the\nunderstanding of the concept of care policy, and adds a new body of empirical evidence to the field of comparative family\npolicy, and gender and social inequalities studies. By developing this study at the Department of Social Policy and\nIntervention at Oxford, the project will benefit from the Department`s multidisciplinary and international perspective and\nexpertise. For the Department the project will add new knowledge and deepen its regional focus on Central and Eastern\nEurope, thus augmenting the Department`s knowledge and coverage of this part of Europe, and its focus on social inequality\nstudies as they relate to childcare.","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

{"text":"Title: MICROMIX-ECO-2015 - Innovative active-uptake foliar nutrition technology capable of significantly reducing pesticide rates Abstract: Crop protection measures are essential to prevent or reduce the productivity losses caused by pests and pathogens. They play a key role in achieving sustainable food production and optimising the use of agricultural resources. This proposal explores the properties of AMIXTM technology in producing inherently healthy plants and simultaneously enhancing the activity of tank-mixed pesticides, facilitating reduced application rates; addressing the call \u2018SFS-8-2015\u2019.\nThe pressure to increase food production is a global phenomenon, caused primarily by increasing world population and climate change. Cereals in particular are in high demand for both food and animal feed purposes. By 2050, when the world population is estimated to reach 9 billion individuals, cereal production is projected to represent 3 billion tons per year. In particular, this challenge affects the EU\u2019s ability to remain competitive and assure its food security, and makes food less affordable for the population. The largest cereal producers - France, Germany, Poland and the UK, add up to 160 million tonnes per year; at least 50% is estimated to be subject to loss of productivity due to the limitations imposed by both current and impending pesticide regulation. AMIXTM uniquely promotes the active uptake of nutrients (as opposed to passive absorption) together with tank-mixed pesticides at the leaf surface. It offers significant and easily measurable nutrient efficiency, consistent yield benefits even in the absence of a detectable nutrient deficiency, with uptake and translocation benefits over other formulation types. AMIXTM can: (i) reduce the amount of pesticide required; extend the effect of the pesticide, increase the effectiveness of less efficient or older generations of pesticides formulations.\nThis business opportunity can support Micromix\u2019s strategy of growing its turnover by a factor of 3, reaching a annual sales volume of 50,000 units (\u20ac11 million) by 2018, adding over 30 extra highskilled jobs","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

This capability will deliver innovative climate science and a new generation of advanced Earth System Models. Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.\nThese goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. \nIt is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. \nWe will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations.

In addition, Arctic development of today is occurring alongside the adverse effects of climate change within an integrated global system deficient in mechanisms for incentivising just transitions toward sustainable development.   With the goal of enhancing the governance capacity of the EU to mitigate this problem, JUSTNORTH brings together 15 partners from 7 disciplines to evaluate the viability of Arctic economic activities. The project will merge justice theories with sustainable development goals to enable EU policy coherence toward just transitions. This will be integrated with an investigation of the empirical realities of existing Arctic economic activities in 18 case studies using innovative research methodology, through conceptual, comparative, descriptive, correlation, policy, legal and interview-based analysis techniques. Though this, JUSTNORTH will offer policy, legal and regulatory pathway recommendations, by developing a frameworks from the reconciliation of the various ethics and value systems present in the Arctic, which can serve as a cornerstone for determining the viability of economic activities in the Arctic in line with the goals of sustainable development.  Ultimately, JUSTNORTH will provide both a negotiation tool for stakeholders to Arctic development (and a potential labelling standard for just\/ethical regulatory standards) in its JUSTscore framework, which will create both transparency, documentation and standardisation for sustainable development across the Arctic (and the EU market).

{"text":"Title: GalRepsDiophantine - Galois Representations and Diophantine Problems Abstract: Wiles' remarkable proof of Fermat's Last Theorem paved the way for the modular approach to Diophantine equations. This associates a Frey elliptic curve to a putative solution of a Diophantine equation and studies it using Galois representations and modularity. This proposal is organized around two research programmes, both of which develop new tools for the modular approach. The first is concerned with distinguishing Galois representations; this is currently the most frequent obstruction to the success of the approach. The second aims to prove modularity and irreducibility theorems for abelian varieties of GL2 type. Such theorems are of tremendous independent interest, but will also allow the replacement of Frey elliptic curves with Frey abelian varieties giving the modular approach immense flexibility.\n\nThe University of Warwick has a strong and active number theory group, making it a natural host for the project. The Supervisor, Professor Siksek, is a leading expert on curves, rational points, Diophantine equations and modularity, with considerable experience in supervising research including eight postdocs and ten completed PhD students.\n\nThe Researcher, Dr Freitas, did his undergraduate studies in Lisbon, and his PhD at the University of Barcelona. He has worked for almost three years in Germany (Bonn and Bayreuth), and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver). He has a successful track record of research in modularity and Diophantine equations, with 12 papers already published or accepted in excellent journals. He was awarded the prestigious 2014 Jose Luis Rubio de Francia prize by the Spanish Mathematical Society.

{"text":"Title: NeuroEE - Delineation of a brain circuit regulating energy expenditure to impact body weight Abstract: Obesity is now a global epidemic with a significant and deleterious impact on human health. My career aim is to clarify the neural underpinnings of energy expenditure (EE) given that this makes a significant contribution to body weight. During my early career, I discovered a circuit linking the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducing thermogenic beige (browning) white adipose tissue (WAT), regulating EE. Moreover, I found that the VMH-BAT axis is utilized by estrogen (Cell Metabolism, 2014) and nicotine (Diabetes, 2012) to increase EE and decrease body weight. My preliminary data indicate that a critical node between the VMH and BAT is the raphe pallidus (RPa), a brain region known to drive sympathetic tone to BAT. My immediate career aim is to clarify the neurochemical communicator receiving the VMH-EE related input and transmitting to BAT and browning. Given that the RPa is rich in the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) which plays a role in thermoregulation, I hypothesize that 5-HT is a crucial component of my circuit. I propose to perform a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship (MSC) under Prof Lora Heisler\u2019s supervision, arguably the global leader in 5-HT obesity research. Her laboratory is in the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Aberdeen, an Institute with more than a century of focused state-of-the-art obesity and nutrition research. This will supply an optimal environment for a MSC providing me with the opportunity to broaden my research interests, and allowing me to construct an international network of obesity researchers. A MSC will also provide the opportunity for me to be trained in transferable next generation engineered genetic technology that will allow me to rigorously and definitively test my current research hypothesis and to provide state-of-the-art expertise that will form a platform for my future career.\n5-HT, brown adipose tissue, browning, raphe pallidus, ventromedial hypothalamus","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: BilProcess - French-English bilinguals' processing of morphosyntactic structures: the case of cross-linguistic transfer Abstract: One question central to both bilingual first language acquisition (2L1) and second language development (L2) research is to understand the mechanisms that lead to systematic interaction between the languages, i.e. cross-linguistic influence (CLI). To-date, we know that bilinguals\u2019 two languages are continuously co-activated to some extent at the lexicon and sentence level. Bilinguals need to map different syntactic forms, i.e. one or more for each language, onto the same discourse function, which occasionally leads to the entrenchment of the non-targetlike form. Yet, little is known about how the age of acquisition (2L1 vs. L2) and language dominance (expressive abilities, language exposure) affect the processing mechanisms governing this phenomenon. \nThis project focuses on an aspect of morphosyntactic development (the article system) known to be particularly challenging for both bilingual children and adults. It adopts a unique comparative approach to investigate whether simultaneous French-English bilingual children\u2019s and L2 adult bilinguals\u2019 sentence comprehension is affected by the parallel activation of the article system in specific and generic contexts in two studies using the self-paced moving window method. French is a very restrictive language and requires the projection of a determiner in argument position. In contrast, English allows bare mass nouns and bare plural nouns in non-specific and generic contexts. These cross-linguistic differences will allow us to test (i) whether the co-activation of distinct morphosyntactic forms (article system) depending on the semantic context (specific vs. generic) leads to language interference in French-English bilinguals\u2019 comprehension of sentence structure; (ii) the role of language exposure vs. productive measures of the relative language dominance on the direction and magnitude of cross-linguistic transfers; (iii) to what extent this phenomenon operates differently depending on the age of language acquisition.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Abstract: Outdoor air pollution is accountable for at least 4.2 million deaths per year worldwide, whilst more than 80% of urban residents are exposed to outdoor air pollution levels greater than the legislative limits. As this outdoor polluted air undergoes exchange with the air inside vehicle cabins, vehicle occupants may suffer elevated exposure to ambient\/outdoor air pollutants of varying extents during this time. Additionaly, personal air pollution exposure within vehicles varies not only under different ventilation settings, but also during time of the day and road type. MMAP-VEX project aims to investigate how the outdoor air quality is a determinable factor of health and personal air pollution exposure in passenger cars. MMAP-VEX will perform concurrent measurements of air pollutants within vehicles and directly outside\/ambient of multiple air pollutants such as concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, PM1 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter \u2264 10, 2.5 and 1 \u00b5m, respectively), ultrafine particles (UFP, with aerodynamic diameter < 300 nm), lung surface deposited area (LSDA), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are critical species in terms of air pollution exposure comparisons. The concurent measurements will take place under different ventilation settings on  urban, sub-urban and rural roads. The insights from these experiments, while significant themselves, will then be used to develop modelling techniques, which, with the use of the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, will be trained in order to estimate personal exposure inside vehicle cabins under different conditions such as cold\/hot weather, air conditioning on\/off or driving in urban\/rural roads.

{"text":"Title: TURBO-REFLEX - TURBOmachinery REtrofits enabling FLEXible back-up capacity for the transition of the European energy system Abstract: The energy sector accounts for two thirds of the global CO2 emissions and is therefore crucial to ensure future green growth and to achieve the global emission reduction targets. Substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can only be achieved by large scale deployment of renewable energy sources, including in particular the most abundant energy sources, wind and sun. Their intermittent nature however poses significant challenges for the energy system as peak demand from the system and peak production form those intermittent sources do not overlap. As there are no large scale storage solutions available yet, other backup capacities are needed. The installed fossil capacity is large enough to provide this back-up power. However, the plants were designed for baseload operation, which results in increased wear and costs through cyclic operation and unnecessarily high emissions in the start-up phase.\nProviding technology upgrades to retrofit the installed power plants to enable flexible operation without penalties on life, cost and emissions is an opportunity to quickly provide the necessary backup capacity to keep the energy system stable and resilient and at the same time enabling higher renewable shares.\nTURBO-REFLEX will follow this approach and has selected technologies for retrofitting critical parts of thermal power plants which have already seen experimental proof-of-concept and are expected to significantly contribute to flexible operation. The technologies will reduce the minimum load, increase the ramp rates and reduce the costs per cycle. This will be achieved by new compressor designs for off-design operability, technologies in the hot gas path, in combustor and turbine, and by new materials, models and sensors to monitor and ensure the mechanical integrity in flexible operation. An integrated assessment will provide not only the technological but also the economic benefits for plant operators, thus ensuring a swift implementation of TURBO-REFLEX technologies.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

A combined hybrid heat and power plant combines a micro gas turbine (MGT) and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). \nThe focus of the technology demonstration plant is to prove the functional capability of the plant concept, followed by detailed characterization and optimization of the integration of both subsystems. The main objective is to move the technology beyond the state of the art to TRL 4.\nElectrical efficiencies of more than 60% and total thermal efficiencies of more than 90% are intended to reach at base load conditions. An operational flexibility ranging from 25% to 100% electric power should be achieved. The emission levels should not exceed 10 ppm NOx and 20 ppm CO (at 15% vol. residual oxygen). The system should allow the use of biogas with methane contents varying from 40-75%, thus covering the biogas qualities from the fermentation of the entire biomass feedstock range.\nTo achieve the objectives the subsystems MGT and SOFC including their subcomponents have to be adjusted and optimized by a multidisciplinary design approach using numerical and experimental measures to ensure a proper balance of plant. In addition an integrated control system has to be developed and implemented to achieve a reliable operation of the coupled subsystems.\nA detailed analysis of different European markets, economic and technical constraints in terms of biogas production potentials will clarify the regional suitable sizes and attractive performance conditions of the power plant system.

{"text":"Title: REDOXCYCLE - The molecular interface between cell cycle and redox regulation Abstract: Aberrant cell cycle and redox regulation are hallmarks of cancer. While cell cycle and redox signaling are extensively studied, it remains poorly understood how both communicate in physiological conditions. One reason is the emphasis on oxidative stress as a signature of cancer cells. Only recently, emerging evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) also function as signaling molecules in physiological conditions, and that some of their key targets are cysteine residues on cell cycle proteins. This indicates that more subtle changes in redox signaling can affect proliferation and have the potential to promote cancer. \n\nI propose to investigate how the cell cycle and redox homeostasis are coupled in a spatial-temporal manner and reveal the differences that distinguish physiological from pathological redox signaling. I will use genetic engineering to label endogenous cell cycle and redox proteins with fluorescent markers. I will measure relative and absolute molecule numbers of cell cycle and redox proteins, relate this to cell cycle and redox states, and determine the cysteines modified on cell cycle proteins. To functionally investigate the pathological potential of identified modifications I will use mammary 3D cell culture \u2013 a model that recapitulates many aspects of mammary architecture in vivo and is used to study early steps of breast tumorigenesis.\n\nI expect our work to provide us with a quantitative description of the interface between cell cycle and redox regulation.

{"text":"Title: MS SPIDOC - Mass Spectrometry for Single Particle Imaging of Dipole Oriented protein Complexes Abstract: The European XFEL has just entered user operation. With its unparalleled peak brilliance and repetition rate, European XFEL has the potential to further applications in single particle imaging (SPI), thus far limited to large viral particles at X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFEL). SPI will allow imaging protein complexes without the need for crystallization. This eventually renders transient conformational states accessible for high resolution structural studies yielding molecular movies of biomolecular machines. A major bottleneck is the wealth of data required to reconstruct a single structure leading to long processing times. This is currently also a problem in electron microscopy (EM).\nMS SPIDOC will overcome this data challenge by developing a native mass spectrometry (MS) system for sample delivery, named X-MS-I. It will provide mass and conformation selected biomolecules, which are oriented along their dipole axis upon imaging. This will enable structural reconstruction from much smaller datasets speeding up the analysis time tremendously. Moreover, the system features low sample consumption and a controlled low background easing pattern identification.\nThe main objectives of the project are:\n\u2022 Deliver mass and conformation separated biomolecules for SPI.\n\u2022 Orient proteins for SPI.\n\u2022 Image protein complex unfolding\n\u2022 Exploit potential of protein orientation for other applications\nThe MS SPIDOC consortium combines internationally leading expertise in different fields relevant to the project: Instrument design and development, computer simulations as well as working with biomolecules in the gas phase and on SPI are combined to implement the novel sample environment at the next generation XFEL facility. New components and methods will be opened to the market and thereby strengthen the European Research Area (ERA) and industry. This early stage high-risk project will give rise to a new technology with major impact on how to derive structures of biomolecules.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: SINTBAT - Silicon based materials and new processing technologies for improved lithium-ion batteries Abstract: According to the European Energy Storage Technology Development Roadmap towards 2030 (EASE\/EERA) energy storage will be of the greatest importance for the European climate energy objectives. The Sintbat project aims at the development of a cheap energy efficient and effectively maintenance free lithium-ion based energy storage system offering in-service time of 20 to 25 years. Insights gained from advanced in-situ and in-operando analysis methods will be used for multi scale modelling targeting on the simulation of aging mechanisms for a reliable lifetime prediction and enhancement. In addition, the latest generation of anode materials based on silicon as well as a prelithiation process for lifetime enhancement will be implemented in the cell manufacturing process. The implementation of high energy materials combined with a low cost and environmental benign aqueous cathode manufacturing process will lead to remarkable cell costs reduction down to 130 \u20ac per kWh. This will enable battery based storage system for an economic reasonable price of less than 400 \u20ac per kWh (CAPEX) and will lower the OPEX down to less than 0.09 \u20ac per stored kWh for the targeted in-service time of 20 to 25 years (10,000 cycles). The technical developments will be supported by the set-up of a relevant roadmap as well as a catalogue for good practice. To guarantee the highest possible impact for the European economy the Sinbat consortium installed an Industrial Advisory Board including various European battery material suppliers, cell manufacturer and end-users whereby the whole value added chain in this way is completed within the Sintbat project. This strong interaction of the Sintbat consortium with relevant stakeholders in the European energy economy will assure that battery based energy storage systems are becoming an economic self-sustaining technology.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: MARTE - Medically Assisted Reproduction: The Effects on Children, Adults and Families Abstract: Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) is one of the most important achievements of medical science in the last generation. In advanced societies, the number of MAR treatments increases every year, and, over the last four decades, more than five million MAR conceived children were born, and many more families received treatment. Given this trend, it is a public health prerogative to find out whether MAR affects the well-being of families. Prior findings are mixed and often hampered by low statistical power or conceptual limitations. I propose a programme of research that goes beyond the state-of-the-art by being the first to analyze comprehensively the effects of MAR on children, adults, and families through a combination of uniquely rich data, previously unused research designs, and conceptual innovations. First, in contrast to past work using small or convenience samples, I use extremely detailed and large datasets from population registers and surveys. Second, I compare the impact of MAR on different domains of life by analysing its effects on a range of adult and child outcomes (e.g., physical\/mental health, education, union stability), thereby allowing me to investigate trade-offs that have not been previously tested. Third, I use innovative research designs to test whether the impact of MAR is causal by comparing children conceived through MAR treatments to their spontaneously conceived siblings, and adults who successfully conceive through MAR to those who are unsuccessful. The project has the potential to produce ground-breaking results that will impact future research in this field. Moreover, the project will have important policy implications, as its findings will be immediately relevant to health professionals advising couples seeking MAR treatments, to public health authorities allocating resources to mitigate the potentially negative effects of MAR on health, and to policy-makers considering whether to (further) subsidize MAR treatments.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: AfricanBioServices - Linking biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services in the Great Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem (GSME) - drivers of change, causalities and sustainable management strategies Abstract: The direct dependence of humans on ecosystem services is by far strongest in developing regions where poverty restricts access to resources. This dependency also makes people in developing countries more sensitive to climate change than their developed counterparts. Increasing human populations deteriorates natural habitat, biodiversity and ecosystems services which spiral into poverty and low human welfare. This calls for innovative solutions that encompass the entire socio-ecological-economic system, as recognized on a global scale in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. However, innovative and practical solutions require downscaling to regional levels for identifying concrete sets of drivers of change. For Africa specifically, the interplay of human population growth, land use change, climate change and human well-being is a major challenge. This project focuses on the Serengeti-Maasai Mara Ecosystem and associated agricultural areas, a region in East Africa that encompasses parts of Kenya and Tanzania. The ecosystem is world-famous for key aspects of its biodiversity, such as the migration of 1.3 million wildebeest. This \u2018flagship ecosystem\u2019 role will enhance the international interest in the project. In this project, internationally leading researchers from Norway, the Netherlands, Scotland, Denmark and Germany are teaming up with strong local partners in Tanzania and Kenya. The research will be organised in seven interlinked work packages: 1) assemble and integrate the so far separate Kenyan and Tanzanian relevant data on the region; 2) quantify the connections between human population growth, land use change, climate change and biodiversity change; 3) test how biodiversity change leads to changes in key ecosystem services; 4) quantify the dependence of human livelihoods on these ecosystem services.

For advertisers in the 21st century the situation has become much worse; up to 98% of click-throughs may actually be from \u201cbots\u201d rather than real people, and only 44% of page impressions even appear on people\u2019s screens. As a result, the \u20ac500m global advertising market is highly inefficient; advertisers are buying blindfold and publishers of genuinely engaging content are undervalued as the bad drives out the good. The ATOM project will address these problems by using eye tracking to accurately measure whether ads actually get seen, by whom, and for how long, enabling market participants to trade the asset they are really interested in \u2013 people\u2019s attention.\n\nThe project will assess the technical feasibility and potential value of various routes to market that arise from scaling Lumen\u2019s existing in-home eye-tracking platform, LUCIAR. LUCIAR collects and analyses eye-tracking data from small panels for testing and optimising the design of advertising. Scaling LUCIAR will provide robust, real-time data on attention to advertising down the long-tail of inventory, with applications in (i) monitoring the attention advertisers are achieving among specific audiences, (ii) valuing publisher\u2019s inventory and the contribution of content providers, and (iii) \u201cprogrammatic\u201d algorithmic media buying. \n\nEurope is well placed to lead this disruption of the advertising industry. The world\u2019s leading eye-tracking hardware companies are based in Europe (Tobii in Sweden; SMI in Germany; EyeTribe in Denmark) and London is a major global locus and leading market in new innovations for the advertising industry.

{"text":"Title: ACCESS2WM - How prior brain states govern access to working memory Abstract: The ability to temporarily maintain and manipulate information in working memory (WM) is critical for adaptive behaviour. Because WM has limited capacity, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that govern selective access to it. I hypothesise that 1) selective access to WM is governed by states of the brain prior to the encoding and retrieval of sensory information (in particular the phase and amplitude of neural oscillations in the different sensory cortices), and that 2) changes in these states provide a common neural substrate through which several cognitive variables affect WM. I will use magneto-encephalography (MEG) to investigate several key aspects of these central hypotheses in healthy human volunteers. This will advance our understanding of the neural and cognitive mechanisms that govern selective access to WM and could ultimately be used to present relevant information when the brain is most susceptible to incorporate this into WM. The project will be carried out at the Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, together with leading scientist in the electrophysiological study of WM (Anna Christina Nobre and Mark Stokes) and the analysis of MEG data (Mark Woolrich). This will allow me to not only perform the proposed research to the highest standard, but also to further develop several key skills (broaden my conceptual horizon, acquire novel analysis techniques, establish long-term collaborations, translate research, etc.) that will further my independence as a researcher and place me in the ideal position to start my own research group within few years after the fellowship.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Microbiomes associated with the host play a key role in health, welfare and environmental efficiency in ruminant production systems. However, despite the information already available, we lack the insights to precisely link the causes and mechanisms of microbial influence on ruminant phenotypes. This is because the interconnection and communication between the animal and its different microbiomes have never been studied in a deep, integrated way. \nThe goal of the project is to elucidate the role of ruminant-associated microbiomes and their interplay with the host in early life and throughout fundamental life events. HoloRuminant will use a holistic multi-omics approach to characterise the acquisition and evolution of microbiomes from different body sites, their inheritability and their influence on the host\u2019s resistance to disease and environmental efficiency of production. Specifically we will: determine microbiomes\u2019 functions by combining multi-level information for microbes, host and their interaction; define microbiomes\u2019 roles during challenging life periods such as perinatal, weaning, and after exposure to pathogens; and evaluate the effect of ruminant microbiomes on critical phenotypes for sustainable production, health and welfare. This will allow the identification of novel microbial markers for monitoring, predicting and selecting phenotypes of interest. By engaging actors from the livestock value chain, we will evaluate the socio-economic impact and acceptability of the innovations proposed among stakeholders and the public.\nHoloRuminant will provide highly innovative, standardized methodologies that will radically advance our understanding of the ruminant holobiont.

{"text":"Title: DIBOR - Unsymmetric diborane(4) compounds for small molecule activation and B-B coupling Abstract: Organoboron complexes are ubiquitous in synthesis due to their utility in functional group transformations and the Nobel Prize winning Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. Furthermore, the advent of frustrated Lewis pair chemistry and BB multiple bonds has demonstrated that organoboron compounds can activate small molecules (e.g., CO) and sigma bonds (including H2), reactivity previously thought to be the domain of transition metal catalysts. As part of the renaissance in organoboron chemistry diborane(4) compounds (R2B-BR2) have received considerable interest, particularly that react as boryl anion equivalents.  Recent unpublished work at UNIMAN has developed an efficient, scalable route to a synthetically useful unsymmetric diborane(4) compound, specifically (RO)2B-BCl2(NHC), (1, NHC = N-heterocyclic Carbene). The DIBOR project will exploit this breakthrough using 1 (and new congeners synthesised in this fellowship) as key precursors to;\n(i) readily synthesised cationic diboranes that are strong electrophiles able to activate small molecules and sigma bonds (C-H) and to diborylate pi nucleophiles; \n(ii) extended homocatenated boron compounds containing both electron precise B-B and B=B bonds. \nAdvances in (i) will generate new transition metal free routes to diborylated hydrocarbons for use as synthetic intermediates. Whilst the demonstration of H-H and C-H activation will demonstrate that individual steps are viable for future application using diboranes in catalytic sigma bond transformations. Advances in (ii) will generate fundamentally new boron entities, e.g., electron precise B4 chains containing B-B and B=B bonds. The chemistry of electron precise boranes is in its infancy but dramatic differences in reactivity to the isoelectronic hydrocarbons have already been reported. Precursor 1 is carefully designed to prevent borane cluster formation on reductive coupling thus facilitate formation of homo-catenated chains.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: IGNIS - Reuse of Tyre Fibres for Fire-Spalling-Proof Concrete Abstract: Fire-induced explosive spalling (violent peeling-off of concrete surface) is a major drawback of modern high-performance and high-strength concrete. Tunnels and buildings have been seen to experience catastrophic failure due to fire spalling of concrete, leading to huge economic costs and potential loss of life. Recent EU directives and legislation require adequate addressing of the spalling problem in any new project and all major existing road tunnels need to be upgraded. However, fire spalling still remains one of the least well understood aspects of concrete behaviour and the need to fill this knowledge gap has significantly increased, due to the increasing demand of infrastructure and materials that are sensitive to spalling. Therefore, the research community has set fire spalling as a research priority; a RILEM Technical Committee (TC256-SPF) has been dedicated to this topic. This research aims to develop a better understanding of the complex mechanism behind fire spalling as well as a novel sustainable spalling-mitigation solution by using waste fibres recovered from end-of-life tyres. If successful, this will enable manufactured polymer fibres, currently used to prevent fire-induced spalling, to be replaced with a reused product of equal or better performance, thereby providing a possible annual reduction of 0.5 million tonnes of CO2 in an EU market worth about \u00a350 million per annum. The fire spalling risk will be investigated through high-temperature slab tests. The test data will be used to develop a predictive numerical model. The host organisation has world-leading expertise in the fields of fire engineering and sustainable concrete technology and it is current coordinating an EU project (ANAGENNISI) on the reuse of tyre components in concrete for ambient temperature applications.

Up to 40% of all deaths occur among the elderly. In spite of all medical efforts, the 5-year mortality was reduced significantly less than that of malignant diseases. This highlights the urgent need to overcome the difficulties associated with present pharmacological therapies (i.e. drug instability, and unspecific targeting) by developing new ground-breaking therapeutic strategies that go far beyond any current regimens. New approaches for safe, efficient, and heart-specific delivery of therapeutics are strongly required. CUPIDO is envisioned to meet these critical needs by providing an unconventional and effective strategy based on nanoparticle-assisted delivery of clinically available and novel therapeutics to the diseased heart. In particular, CUPIDO will develop innovative bioinspired hybrid nanoparticles formulated as biologicals delivery, which are i) biocompatible and biodegradable, ii) designed for crossing biological barriers, and iii) guidable to the heart. A combination of multidisciplinary manufacturing and validation approaches will be employed, bringing the envisioned product beyond the currently available clinical and day-to-day management of CD individuals. Scale-up production,  and respect of medical regulatory requirements will allow CUPIDO to deliver a final product for future late pre-clinical and clinical studies.

{"text":"Title: Class II PI3K - Characterization of the signalling and physiological roles of the class II PI3Ks Abstract: Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are lipid kinases that generate intracellular second messengers in signal transduction and membrane trafficking pathways and are important drug targets. This proposal seeks to delineate the roles and mechanism of action of a group of PI3Ks which have remained enigmatic ever since their discovery over a decade ago.\nThe PI3K family comprises eight members in three subclasses. Class I PI3Ks signal downstream of growth factor and G protein-coupled receptors, are amongst the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and are being exploited as drug targets. The class II and III PI3Ks have in part emerged as regulators of membrane trafficking pathways but their physiological roles remain poorly understood.\nWe aim to identify the physiological roles of the class II PI3K-C2\u03b1 and \u03b2 and to characterize the impact of their kinase activity on signalling pathways. To analyse the roles of class II PI3K activity in vivo, the Host Laboratory has created constitutive global and conditional knock-in kinase-inactive mice (unpublished). In contrast to PI3K gene knockout models, these mouse lines allow us to specifically address kinase-dependent functions and hence are an ideal model to evaluate the potential of class II PI3Ks as drug targets.\nThe class II PI3K-C2\u03b1 (C2\u03b1) is involved in endo- and exocytosis as well as endocytic recycling, whereas PI3K-C2\u03b2 (C2\u03b2) has been implicated in cell migration. However, their influence on cellular signalling is unknown. As an initial approach, the Host Laboratory performed a screen for proteins interacting with C2\u03b1 or C2\u03b2 (unpublished). We will explore hits from this screen using the kinase-inactive knock-in mice and cells derived thereof as discovery tools. \nThe combination of my expertise in membrane traffic and phosphoinositide regulation with the mouse and signalling studies of the Host Laboratory form an excellent and timely basis to uncover the roles of the class II PI3Ks in mammalian biology.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: NPTC - New Perspectives in Tropospheric Chemistry Abstract: The last two hundred years have seen new anthropogenic emissions dramatically change the chemical composition and chemistry of the troposphere, creating a diverse set of atmospheric conditions based on location and level of human population. Reducing climate change and reversing the negative impacts humans have on the atmosphere is a clear European Commission target moving forward towards 2020. Alkenes are common to pristine, clean air environments (biogenic sources) and polluted, urban environments (anthropogenic emissions). The removal of alkenes from the troposphere predominantly occurs through reaction with ozone, generating a wide range of products including OH, CO and CO2, which have a significant impact upon the chemistry of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Despite the abundance of alkenes in the atmosphere, the atmospheric ozonolysis of alkenes is still poorly understood. \nDr Beames intends to use this Fellowship to build a new research group at Cardiff University, using advanced physical chemistry techniques to study an elusive intermediate species in these ozonolysis reactions, which are known as Criegee intermediates (carbonyl oxides). Criegee intermediates are a dominant source of night-time OH\u2022 (a \u2018tropospheric detergent\u2019) and are implicated in aerosol formation.  These species have only recently been directly detected, and have become a hot topic in both atmospheric chemistry and physical chemistry fields.

{"text":"Title: G4-PTROs - Regulatory network of G-quadruplex dependent Post-Transcriptional mRNA Operons (PTROs) Abstract: Many studies of global gene expression focus solely on studying the transcriptome thereby only assessing mRNA abundance. However, transcription is only a single layer of gene expression and recently, the influence of post-transcriptional regulation has become undeniable. Rather underrepresented players in post-transcriptional control are G-quadruplexes (G4s). These stable structures can form guanine tetrads in DNA and RNA via p-p-stacking of several planar arrangements of four guanine bases stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and a central metal cation. Recent reports have pointed to an important regulatory role of G4 motives in key cellular functions including pre-mRNA processing, RNA turnover, mRNA transport thereby suggesting intriguing links to human diseases as cancer and neurological disorders. G4 structures in mRNAs seem to act as signaling components that constitute an own post-transcriptional operon. Recruitment of G4-specific RBPs then determines the ultimate fate of G4-containing mRNAs. Not many RBPs or upstream regulatory factors of G4s have been identified and the functional consequences of these interactions are not known. In this proposal I will address these questions. First, I will identify mRNAs that are differentially translated and\/or stabilized in the presence of the G4 specific ligand pyridostatin (PDS), which stabilizes G4 structures. The resulting comprehensive list of mRNAs will be the first data set that provides a mechanistically link of G4 motive regulation. Secondly, I will identify factors in the G4 regulatory network using a genome wide shRNA assay to determine proteins that modulate the stability and\/or the translation of G4 motive containing mRNAs. It is important to understand G4 structure-function relationships and upstream regulatory processes as the emerging link between G4 formation and human disease opens up an exciting research direction that has potential implications for therapeutic intervention.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: Target-N2O - Targeting N2O emission hot-spots in dairy pastures for mitigation action: microbes, stable isotope methods and modelling Abstract: Nitrogen (N) limits primary productivity in most terrestrial ecosystems, which has led to increased use of N fertilisers within farming systems. The amount of reactive N in global circulation has more than doubled; this has global significance as the N can cascade through different chemical forms in land, air and water, leading to a range of human health and environmental impacts. In order to achieve sustainable food production systems of the future, there is a need to improve knowledge on the best management of farm N, especially under increased demand for food production under a burgeoning human population. The Target-N2O project will deliver a high quality training-through research project aiming to improve N use efficiency and reduce emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas, N2O, from intensive dairy farms. The project will combine multi-disciplinary techniques in a novel way, including molecular ecology, stable isotope methods and whole-farm system modelling to determine the cost-benefits of an N loss mitigation strategy. The strategy would be to apply nitrification inhibitors to pasture areas which have been identified as farm-scale N2O emission hot-spots (e.g. areas of pasture around gateways, livestock shelter areas and camping areas). Such areas receive regular inputs of nutrients including labile N (through urine events) and carbon sources (via dung), which fuel microbial processes leading to enhanced and spatially variable GHG emissions. Evidence of the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitors to reduce N losses from these areas are lacking. The results of the action will have cross-sectoral impact (scientists, dairy and fertiliser industries and policy makers).

Science ranked a schistosomiasis-vaccine as one of the top-10 vaccines urgently needed. Chemotherapy is the preferred method for schistosomiasis control; but the effectiveness of mass-treatment programs is compromised by reinfection requiring regular re-treatment. An efficacious vaccine, with long-lasting protection against all schistosomiasis forms, would impact disease control. We request funding for the clinical development of our SchistoShield\u00ae-vaccine (Sm- p80 antigen+GLA-SE adjuvant) in Burkina Faso and Madagascar, where Schistosoma mansoni (causing intestinal\/ hepatic schistosomiasis) and S. haematobium (causing urinary schistosomiasis) are endemic. In baboon studies, SchistoShield\u00ae has been effective against all major schistosome species. It is the only vaccine candidate having consistently exhibited potent prophylactic, anti-fecundity, egg-induced pathology resolving, transmission-blocking and therapeutic efficacy. The objectives are to 1) assess the safety\/immunogenicity of SchistoShield\u00ae in a Phase I clinical study in healthy adults from Africa; 2) refine and develop a female worm schistosome human challenge model; 3) identify correlates of protection, innate and adaptive immune signatures, gene expression and the role of antibodies in the prevention\/control of Schistosoma infections; and 4) foster a global consortium to advance research on schistosomiasis disease burden, vaccines and address downstream access constraints in resource-poor settings. The funding requested will allow the clinical development of SchistoShield\u00ae. African site research capacity will be improved and epidemiological burden data using novel diagnostic techniques will be used to advance clinical development to Phase 2 and potential future elimination project","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: OXYFLUX - Oxygen flux measurements as a new tracer for the carbon and nitrogen cycles in terrestrial ecosystems Abstract: Atmospheric oxygen (O2) measurements have proven to be one of the most powerful tools to study the carbon cycle at global scale, quantifying the carbon dioxide (CO2) sink of terrestrial ecosystems and oceans. At ecosystem level, O2 is closely related to CO2 through photosynthesis and respiration, and is influenced by sources of nitrogen during plant uptake. O2 thus carries valuable information about ecosystem processes that cannot be learned from CO2 alone. However, the potential of O2 measurements at ecosystem level has not been exploited. The major hindrance has been the technical challenges faced to measure atmospheric O2 at ppm level against a background concentration of 21%. Motivated by the enormous insights gained from O2 measurements at global level, and with the assistance of proven experts in O2 measurement, OXYFLUX will provide pioneering breakthroughs in both measurement techniques and scientific\nknowledge of terrestrial ecosystems. Specifically, OXYFLUX will perform the methodological, experimental and modelling work needed to develop O2 as a new tracer for carbon and nitrogen cycle processes at ecosystem level. We will establish the first research group worldwide to perform continuous O2 flux measurements at forest and agricultural field sites, using gas exchange chambers and micrometeorological approaches. These measurements will be utilised further in modelling\nwork where we will integrate O2 into two complementary terrestrial ecosystem models. This will provide the mechanistic understanding for a unique approach to (a) partition CO2 fluxes in e.g. forest ecosystems, (b) improve understanding of the carbon and nitrogen cycle in arable land, and (c) identify the sensitivity of O2 fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems to environmental change. OXYFLUX will firmly establish O2 as a new research tool that can be applied to promote further breakthroughs in a large range of scientific disciplines including environmental, forest and agricultural sciences.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Abstract: The power of 3D X-ray imaging in healthcare in the form of Computed Tomography (CT) is widely accepted, but despite the widespread availability of CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) it is still the basic 2D planar X-ray that constitutes the majority (circa 60%) of medical imaging studies worldwide. Planar X-ray continues to be the \u201cworkhorse of radiology\u201d because of its availability, low cost and small system footprint (compared to MRI and CT); its speed of image acquisition and review (compared to all other modalities); its ability to visualize tissues like bone (unlike MRI and Ultrasound); its low radiation dose (unlike CT); and its consistency and objectivity of image acquisition (unlike Ultrasound).\n\nTomosynthesis, a method for performing high-resolution limited-angle tomography at low dose levels, has already transformed breast cancer screening and has demonstrated an ability to near-equal CT in identifying lung nodules symptomatic of lung cancer.\n\nOur innovation is a Flat Panel X-ray Source (FPS) that allows tomosynthesis without any moving parts. This will reduce costs and enhance acquisition speed and allows the source to be closer to the subject, reducing power needs and further reducing cost.\n\nUnlike current tomosynthesis devices that move the source in 1 dimension, a system using an FPS could vary emission in 2 dimensions which could enhance depth resolution and the ability to localise objects. This would enhance the ability to quantify features, including biomarkers of disease progression.\n\nAdaptix will transform planar X-ray by giving it true 3D capability, making it safer by reducing dose (versus CT, and potentially versus planar X-ray), making the systems 50% cheaper than existing market offerings and reducing weight and size by 90%. By doing this we will be improving access to the world\u2019s most important medical diagnostic device and radically changing a $5bn global market.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

SMMs are the focus of considerable multidisciplinary investigations because of their potential for high-density information storage and quantum computing. Most work until now has focussed on lanthanides, but there has been an increasing realisation that organotransition metal derived SMMs may offer significant benefits in terms of their ability to stabilise different electronic environments as a result of being able to adopt unique coordination geometries. MEVs approach will be to use large ring NHC ligands and probe the influence of ring size, substituents, coordination mode and resulting molecular geometry on magnetic behaviour. The project will utilise the research experience of the applicant in synthetic chemistry to make new compounds in Bath, but most importantly, provide her a unique opportunity to develop new skills for progression of her career by exposure to new techniques and methodologies through periods of secondment to internationally leading laboratories for studies of magnetism (Prof Annie Powell (AKP), Karlsruhe, Germany), paramagnetism via Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (Prof Damien Murphy (DMM), Cardiff, UK) and computational chemistry (Prof Stuart Macgregor (SAM), Heriot-Watt, UK).","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

However, we are still far from accurately estimating these services using the state-of-the-art operational models at the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Monitoring and Forecasting Centres (MFCs).\nThe main aim of SEAMLESS is to provide CMEMS MFCs with unprecedented capabilities to deliver indicators of climate-change impacts and food security in ocean ecosystems, such as particulate carbon export and plankton phenology.\nThe central hypothesis of SEAMLESS is that new ensemble data assimilation methods can better estimate crucial ecosystem indicators by integrating the new generation of European Copernicus satellite observations and in-situ ocean data. Specifically, our approach will link coherently biogeochemical and hydrodynamic simulations. The hypothesis is supported by our previous work, in which we improved the MFCs\u2019 model simulations of the plankton stocks at the base of the marine food web by assimilating biogeochemical and physical data from satellites, Biogeochemical-Argo floats and gliders. \nSEAMLESS will develop a new assimilation prototype that will expand simulations to plankton dynamics and related biogeochemical processes, e.g., plankton phenology and carbon export. This prototype will be disseminated to CMEMS stakeholders and the wider oceanographic community. To guarantee the integration of SEAMLESS into CMEMS, we have assembled a team with outstanding expertise and track records for all the key project components, which includes CMEMS MFC core developers, and will be supported by policy, blue-growth and academic stakeholders.

{"text":"Title: BUFFS - Bootstrap and Uniqueness for Form Factors and the S-matrix Abstract: Scattering amplitudes and form factors are fundamentally important quantities in quantum field theories, directly related to physical observables such as probabilities of particle interactions measured in collider experiments. Over the last decades, studies of these objects have revealed beautiful physical and mathematical structures, which have inspired powerful computational methods making accessible previously impossible calculations. The goal of this project is to further uncover such hidden structures, by exploiting a surprising interplay of fundamental principles. One focus will be on recently discovered infrared and ultraviolet principles, their possible duality, and how they can be used to construct scattering amplitudes in new ways that expose unitarity as an emergent property. Next, the project will explore the expression of unitarity as a geometry of positive constraints, which was conjectured to fully define string theory amplitudes. The final main goal is the application of such on-shell principles and the color-kinematic duality to form factors, off-shell generalisations of scattering amplitudes of great phenomenological importance. The project also encompasses a comprehensive program for the dissemination and communication of its results. The former will be based on publications in high impact journals and talks at major conferences, while the latter involves diverse outreach activities targeted at a wide range of audiences. The researcher will benefit from a bespoke training program, including courses in career management, public engagement, teaching activities, and participation in scientific workshops. The balanced distribution of these complementary activities is designed to optimise the benefit for the researcher, to increase his visibility and independence, to enhance his skills portfolio and, hence, to prepare him for a permanent academic position in the future.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The project will demonstrate the EU MW scale first-of-a-kind waste heat-sCO2 plant towards a cheaper\/more flexible waste heat valorisation. The project will strengthen EU industrial leadership in both energy intensive industries (making them more competitive) and turbomachinery sectors, bridging the current gap on sCO2 turbomachinery that EU has with US and Japan-Korea. The project will analyse sCO2 WH2P potential from a technical, economic and environmental point of view, developing innovative models for the design of the cycle and of the turbomachinery as well as investigating CO2OLHEAT cycle benefits in the cement, glass, aluminium, power generation sectors via techno-economic and Life Cycle based replication feasibility studies, involving relevant EU industrial players (EDF, ENGIE, MYTH, CEMEX, SISECAM, CELSA).

{"text":"Title: WFNQMC - Development of a Novel Computational Toolbox for Stochastic Electronic Structure in Chemistry and Condensed Matter Abstract: Atomistic computational modelling is increasingly an integral component of almost all areas of chemistry, physics and materials science, especially as its predictive ability improves. However, not all systems are equal when it comes to the predictive capabilities of current methods, and many systems are too large or many-body effects too complex to be routinely tractable. The result is that the promise of \u2018materials by design\u2019, deduction of reaction pathways or routine simulation on a par with experimental accuracy has not in general come to fruition. This ambitious proposal aims to address this, with development of a suite of novel approaches to stochastically sample the wavefunction. Recent work by the PI has already made huge strides in this direction, with an emerging approach in quantum chemical space having remarkable success for accurate solutions of small problems. Here, we first propose a number of novel developments to order to extend this approach from a tool for small systems to a widespread disruptive technology, with application to a variety of challenging problems. This involves development of the scope, scaling, accuracy and capabilities of this sampling, including admitting time-dependent, spectral and relativistic extensions. Next, we aim to take the successful philosophy of this sampling and exploit its powerful approach in order to reformulate a number of well-established electronic structure tools. Allowing stochasticity has the potential to yield low-scaling formulations of these methods, able to naturally exploit inherent sparsity, and have a revolutionary impact on their use and success. This proposal is highly interdisciplinary, spanning a range of applications and techniques in quantum chemistry, condensed matter and materials science, brought together under the banner of exploiting inherent sparsity by establishing a new paradigm of stochastic tools for correlated electrons, with the opportunity for tremendous impact in a number of fields.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Although a more thorough understanding of thermal comfort over recent years has led to significant increases in energy efficiency through better insulation and natural ventilation, substantial room for improvement still exists. With Electric Vehicles (EVs) in particular, which are emerging as the most sustainable option for both satisfying the future mobility needs in Europe and reducing the impact on the environment, inefficiencies must be minimized due to their detrimental effect on the range.\nStarting with activities to gain a better understanding of comfort, combined with the development of numerical models which represent both the thermal and acoustic characteristics of the passenger compartment, DOMUS aims to create a validated framework for virtual assessment and optimization of the energy used. In parallel, innovative solutions for glazing, seats, insulation and radiant panels, will be developed along with controllers to optimize their performance individually and when operating in combination, the optimal configuration of which will be derived through numerical simulation.\nThe aim is that the combined approach of innovating at a component level together with optimising the overall configuration will deliver at least the targeted 25% improvement in EV range without compromising passenger comfort and safety. Furthermore, the project will demonstrate the key elements of the new approach in a real prototype vehicle. As such DOMUS aims to create a revolutionary approach to the design of vehicles from a user-centric perspective for optimal efficiency, the application of which will be key to increasing range and hence customer acceptance and market penetration of EVs in Europe and around the world in the coming years.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Footwear and tyre traces are captured using modern optical 3D-scanning technology and investigated using a 3D analysis software focussed on forensic end users. The project culminated in the demonstration of the system prototype outdoors under the same conditions of those typically found at crime scenes by the Dutch police from the region of Zeeland West-Brabant.\n3D-Forensics \/ FTI will bridge the so called \u201cvalley of death\u201d between a successful research and technological development and market introduction of innovation. It will finish off the footwear and tyre trace 3D scanning and analysis idea from an already advanced project output to make it market mature and ready for launch. In essence 3D-Forensics \/ FTI will implement the last steps identified as necessary at the end of the previous FP7 project. The resulting advanced prototypes will be tested, including in \u201cround robin\u201d  tests by six forensic end users for performance verification and in a further phase the prototypes from a pilot line with the same or very similar specifications as the first product to be launched will be validated in a relevant accredited process. Communication with the forensic community together with the feedback from the testing and validation exercises will enable our business model to be fine-tuned and validated.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: NovoFold - De novo protein discovery as a tool for understanding the folding conundrum Abstract: Order is a prerequisite for activity, which is the essence of the sequence-structure-function paradigm of bio-macromolecules. Proteins are a case in point, displaying intricate architectures and impressive functions. Understanding how the primary sequence of these complex macromolecules relates to their 3D structure and vice versa is of fundamental interest and the basis for broad technological exploitation of proteins. \nThe proposed research aims to investigate the folding space of proteins, gaining new insights that will help in solving the folding conundrum. Specifically, the frequency and sequence patterns of ordered polypeptides and their physical and structural properties will be experimentally analysed. Based on these data sets, exploratory data analysis can be performed, providing unprecedented insights into protein folding. Generation of quantifiable high quality data is thus of utmost importance for this project. One of the main objectives of this proposal is therefore the development of an ultrahigh-throughput experimental platform for discovery of de novo proteins with unparalleled precision, using state-of-the-art molecular biology methods. Based on cutting-edge mRNA display technology, I will isolate folded polypeptides from na\u00efve libraries with up to 1E13 members in the size range of 50-100 amino acids. Modern bioinformatic analysis, modelling and biophysical characterisation will be performed to analyse the folding space of proteins and derive new empirical folding rules. \nGiven the increasing importance of protein engineering in fundamental research and industry, the results of this study will be of interest to a wide range of scientists. The fellowship will provide training in state-of-the-art techniques such as statistical data analysis and structural biology.

The prototypes to improve policy design efficiency and coherence (PDEC) within each of the European countries, and in the European Union as a whole, will be realised through understanding the decision-making function relationships between companies and policy makers. The approach will employ questionnaires to policy makers, which have designed past incentives towards internationalization; and firms, which have used these same incentives. The insights gained will be used to generate models to explain the behaviour of both managers and policy makers in their actions and to arrive at set of principles of action for PEC. The work plan will be executed at the University of Leeds at a time when there is an EU policy (Lisbon Treaty) highlights the need of coordination of policies, the coherence in external relations, and the consistency with the potential complementarities between trade and FDI within EU members and considering third countries.\n\"\"\n\"","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

{"text":"Title: HIGGSBNDL - Higgs bundles: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Geometry Abstract: String theory provides a unified description of particle physics and gravity, within a consistent theory of quantum gravity. The goal of this research is to develop both the phenomenological implications as well as conceptual foundations of string theory and its non-perturbative completions, M- and F-theory. Both, seemingly independent, questions are deeply connected to a mathematical structure, the Higgs bundle, which characterizes supersymmetric vacua of dimensionally reduced gauge theories, and insights into the moduli space of Higgs bundles will result in a fruitful cross-connection between these subjects.\nFor string theory to engage in a meaningful dialog with particle physics, it is paramount to gain a universal understanding of the low energy effective theories that can arise from it. Building on the success of studying F-theory vacua in terms of Higgs bundles, we propose to develop the Higgs bundle approach for M-theory on G2-manifolds, leading to a universal characterization of the low energy physics. Methods developed for Higgs bundles of d = 3 N = 2 theories obtained from M5-branes on three-manifolds will be used in this process. Associated to each Higgs bundle is a local G2 manifold and we propose a way (using new results in geometry) to construct compact G2 spaces associated to these, which manifestly ensure the phenomenological soundness of the compactifications.\nHiggs bundles have recently also played a key role in studying the compactifications of the M5-brane in M-theory. We propose and develop a new duality between a d = 4 theory on a four-manifold X4 and a d = 2, N = (2,0) supersymmetric gauge theory on a two-sphere S2, obtained by considering the M5-brane theory on X4xS2. The supersymmetric vacua have a characterization in terms of Higgs bundles, which can be studied with tools developed for F- theory Higgs bundles on four-manifolds. Furthermore we propose a concrete approach to derive this duality from first principles.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: NeuroUTR - Systematic investigation of the functional coupling between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying tissue-specific 3'UTRs variability. Abstract: 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) serve as a key platform in the RNA regulatory network that controls mRNA translational efficiency, localisation and stability. Of all human cell-types, brain-specific isoforms have the longest 3' UTRs and therefore their regulation is likely to be most complex. Moreover, mutations perturbing the mRNA secondary structure and sites of mRNA-miRNA interactions can lead to diseases such as neurodegeneration. Isoforms of variable 3' UTRs are engendered by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (polyA) site selection. Of the many factors contributing to this process, both transcriptional and RNA regulatory interactions have been extensively studied. Yet the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the systematic tissue-specific polyA site selection remain largely unknown. Here I hypothesise that changes in transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and polyA factors activities together regulate the condition-specificity of this process. Furthermore I hypothesise that the resulting 3' UTR sequence variation contributes to increased protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders such as motor neurone disease (MND), a common but incurable disorder in which mRNA metabolism and protein homeostasis are disrupted. Here using bioinformatic approaches I will integrate a variety of genomic measurements, and systematically identify tissue-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying polyA site selection. I will develop linear models to characterise the genome-wide functional coupling between these regulatory interactions and study how these associate with MND in regulating alternative 3' UTRs. In doing this project I will not only advance our current knowledge about RNA regulation but I will enable a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying MND, and in the long term, the future development of new therapies that ameliorate the regulation of 3' UTRs in neurodegenerative diseases.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: RECOBA - Cross-sectorial real-time sensing, advanced control and optimisation of batch processes saving energy and raw materials Abstract: In many aspects batch processes are superior to continuous. Therefore it is worthwhile to take advantage of recent progress in sensor technologies, modelling and automation to develop a new paradigm for the design and conduction of batch processes: a) operation at maximum efficiency, b) dynamic, quality driven process trajectories rather than fixed schedules c) detailed analysis and tracking of all relevant process and product parameter. The main objective of the proposed project is the maximization of efficiency (reg. quality, energy, raw materials, and costs) of batch processes. \nIntegrated process control is essential for an efficient operation of industrial batch processes: it tracks the evolution of product properties, detects deviations from the target values for product quality and derives corrective actions at a stage when an automatic compensation of deviations from an optimal trajectory is still possible. This contributes to optimal energy and raw material utilisation, shortens production time and enhanced the product quality. \nWith the ambition to deliver solutions with relevance to all sectors of the process industries, the RECOBA consortium represents a selection of batch processes operating industries and partners across the value chain of batch process control, among them 3 global players from the polymer industry (BASF), the steel industry (TKSE), and the silicon metal industry (ELKEM). \nWithin RECOBA there will be developed and validated:\n(1) new & innovative solutions for the measurement of different types of quality aspects, \n(2) new models to realise integrated process control of batch processes & suitable online parameter adaptation technologies to keep these models valid,\n(3) control modules to realise concepts for real-time, model based & closed loop process control, which are easily adaptable to existing batch processes in various industrial sectors,\n(4) business models to approach relevant industrial sectors for a future market entry.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Abstract: The fuselage of the next generation of Large Passenger Aircrafts\u00b4 (LPA) will be made with thermoplastic (TP) composites.

Thanks to a self-heated tool with process driven heating zones and advanced lay up process simulation, FRAMES will be capable of predicting heating law for efficient TP-AFP, correlated with lay-up trials, mastering TP-stiffeners manufacturing process, optimizing co-consolidation cycle.

{"text":"Title: PI3K-in-tolerance - PI3K delta role in dendritic cell antigen processing and presentation to control gut tolerance Abstract: PI3Ks controls important biological processes immunity controlling vesicular trafficking and cell signaling events triggered by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). The engagement of PRRs leading to DC antigen processing and presentation (APP) is essential for the bridge between innate and adaptive immunity.  Thus, DCs are crucial for resistance against pathogens, while concurrently maintaining tolerance to the commensal microbiota and environmental antigens. Crohn\u2019s disease (CD)-like pathology has been documented in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), originating from mutations in genes encoding NADPH oxidase (NOX2) subunits or RAC2 GTPase. Both PRR-activated NOX2 and RAC2 are critical for inducing phagosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) linked to APP processes in the DC. Thus, that dysregulated PRR signalling and NOX2 activity in the DC phagosome, may be key steps involved in some of the pathology observed in CD. The PRR family member NOD2 senses muramyl dipeptide in bacteria. NOD2 was the first susceptibility gene identified for CD and associated with tolerance mechanisms mediating intestinal homeostasis to gut microbiota. Recently, interactions between NOD2 and microbiome were shown to stimulate Treg activity at the mucosal sites. Bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from gut commensal Bacteriodes fragilis induce mucosal tolerance by DC-intrinsic activation of NOD2 and enabling DCs to induce IL10 production from Tregs. It is known that OMVs require NOX2-induced ROS to be released for APP and presented by MHCII to activate CD4 Tregs. Our preliminary data shows that mice inactivated in the kinase domain of PI3K delta spontaneously develop colitis in the presence of an intestinal opportunistic pathogens and show defects in antigen presentation in DCs in vitro. Based on these results, I propose to investigate the DC-intrinsic PI3K role in APP functions that control gut tolerance in this animal model of colitis.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: NEURO_NMD - Functional impact of alternative splicing coupled to nonsense-mediated decay in developing neurons Abstract: Differentiation of precursor cells into mature neurons relies on transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression that have to be coordinated in a precise spatiotemporal fashion. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing coupled to nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD) is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism known to orchestrate gene expression dynamics in developmental contexts. Earlier studies identified several neural targets of this pathway; however, in most cases, the extent to which AS-NMD contributes to the overall gene expression dynamics and biological significance of this regulation is poorly understood. Moreover, whether AS-NMD target repertoire undergoes considerable changes in developing brain and how this might fit to the global regulation network underlying neuronal differentiation remains unclear. I will address these questions using two separate approaches. First, I will investigate novel AS-NMD targets encoding actin cytoskeleton factors and controlled by an important regulator of neuronal alternative splicing, Ptbp1. I will elucidate the extent of AS-NMD regulation in these genes by modulating the inclusion of the NMD-promoting exons with corresponding antisense oligonucleotides. in mouse embryonic stem cells undergoing neuronal differentiation, neural stem cells and primary neurons. Second, I will systematically analyse how NMD contributes to different stages of neuronal development by acutely inhibiting this pathway in a time-resolved manner using genetic means. I will then identify gene expression effects and functional consequences of NMD inactivation using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and appropriate cell biological methods.

In IN-FET, we address this issue by manipulating the elementary building blocks of cell excitability: ions. IN-FET tackles the visionary idea of altering neuronal firing and synaptic transmission by direct ionic actuation at the microscopic scale, while monitoring cell responses by arrays of nanoscale transistors. We will develop and test, in vitro, the use of active polymers to trap or release electrochemically specific ions in the extracellular milieu surrounding neurons. These will be integrated with ion sensors and ultra-sensitive nanowire arrays, offering closed-loop regulation of cellular electrical activity. We will deliver for the first time a device that can physiologically modulate the neuronal membrane potential, the synaptic release probability, and glutamatergic NMDA receptors activation by altering potassium, calcium, and magnesium ionic concentrations in a controlled and spatially-confined manner.

The gradual loss of sea ice, increase in temperature, invasive species and compounding effects of additional ecosystem stressors are identified as likely causes of the observed turnover of Arctic species. Other issues of concern are the climatic tipping elements that are known to have affected the region in the geologic past, and that could well affect the region in the future, precipitating a regime shift of unprecedented magnitude. Predicting these changes in the Arctic ecosystem is hindered by several knowledge gaps, particularly in terms of mechanistic understanding of the coupling between drivers and responses.  At stake are two important marine ecosystem services that human societies rely on; carbon sequestration with its feedback to global climate, and fisheries production that is the economic lifeblood of many of the local societies of the Arctic. ECOTIP will map out past and present Arctic biodiversity and its response to external drivers, and the effects of expanding commercial activities in the Arctic under expected climate change. It will investigate the resistance, resilience and persistence of key ecosystem components to multiple anthropogenic stressors, and estimate their potential tipping dynamics. It will use a  trait-based approach in process studies, empirical analysis and numerical models as a novel means of quantifying functional diversity to predict how different anthropogenic forcing scenarios (including climate, invasive species, pollution, exploitation) change biodiversity, productivity and ecosystem services.

I will interview and observe journalists and media actors from four major UK media organizations.\nSCOOP will enhance my career as a professional journalist and as an educator of journalists. Cardiff University and HiOA will benefit from my enhanced skills and by the establishment of a virtual centre of investigative journalism to implement the outcomes of SCOOP, this should expand journalism research and training. SCOOP will benefit the media industry and journalism studies in general at a time of profound changes in the profession.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: MinBioTag - A minimal Cys-cyclobutene non-canonical amino acid for bioorthogonal imaging of proteins in live cells Abstract: Insight into dynamic processes such as uptake and intracellular trafficking and signalling of small molecules and proteins in cells is key in basic biology and drug development. The use of bioorthogonal chemical reactions for labelling and probing specific biomolecules is an exciting option but a very challenging task as these transformations should proceed very rapidly in physiological conditions with complete chemoselectivity. So, in this application we propose to achieve site-selective protein labelling by the introduction of a non-canonical Cys-cyclobutene aminoacid and a very fast alkene chemoselective ligation reaction. The small size of the proposed alkene-tagged aminoacid should not interfere with the protein structure, function, activity or localisation in contrast with other fluorescent tags such as the use of fusion proteins as GFP. This project aims at 1) developing  a new photo triggered [2+2] cycloaddition bioorthogonal ligation between two alkene containing partners and to apply the already established IEDDA reaction between tetrazines and dienophiles. While the use of light as a trigger offers the possibility for an improved spatial and temporal resolution,  the use of tetrazine fluorogenic probes allows for \u2018turn-on\u2019 fluorescence on their rapid reaction with dienophiles 2) use these optimized reaction to study apoptosis in cells and tissues by introducing the proposed Cys-cyclobutene non-canonical amino acid into C2A Domain of Synaptotagmin-I followed by the ligation reaction ex vivo and in vivo","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

{"text":"Title: OPT-PCC - Optimized Dynamic Point Cloud Compression Abstract: 3D point clouds are receiving increased attention due to their potential for many important applications, such as real-time 3D immersive telepresence. Compared to traditional video technology, 3D point cloud systems allow free viewpoint rendering, as well as mixing of natural and synthetic objects. However, this improved user experience comes at the cost of increased storage and bandwidth requirements as point clouds are typically represented by the geometry and colour of millions up to billions of 3D points. For this reason, major efforts are being made to develop efficient point cloud compression schemes. The task, however, is very challenging due to the irregular structure of point clouds. To standardize these efforts, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) launched in January 2017 a call for proposals for 3D point cloud compression technology. In October 2017, the responses were evaluated and the first test model for lossy compression of dynamic point clouds (TMC2) was established. This test model defines a first \u201ccommon core\u201d algorithm for collaborative work towards the final standard. The aim of OPT-PCC is to contribute to these efforts by developing algorithms that optimize the rate-distortion performance of the test model. OPT-PCC\u2019s objectives are to: \n\n1.\tO1: build analytical models that accurately describe the effect of the geometry and colour quantization of a 3D point cloud on the bit rate and distortion; \n2.\tO2: develop fast search algorithms that optimize the allocation of the available bit budget between the geometry information and colour information; \n3.\tO3: implement a compression scheme for dynamic 3D point clouds that outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of rate-distortion performance. The target is to reduce the bit rate by at least 20% for the same reconstruction quality;  \n4.\tO4: provide multi-disciplinary training to the researcher in algorithm design, metaheuristic optimisation, computer graphics, and leadership and management skills.","gt":false,"conf":0.8}
{"text":"Title: ERIGrid - European Research Infrastructure supporting Smart Grid Systems Technology Development, Validation and Roll Out Abstract: Renewable energy sources are key enablers to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and to cope with the anthropogenic global warming. The intermittent behaviour of them and their limited storage capabilities present new challenges to power system operators in maintaining power quality and reliability. However, the increased availability of advanced automation and communication technologies has also provided new intelligent solutions to these challenges. Previous work has presented various new methods to operate highly interconnected power grids with corresponding components in a more effective way. As a consequence of these developments the traditional power system is transformed into a cyber-physical system, a Smart Grid. Previous and ongoing research activities have mainly focused on validating certain aspects of Smart Grids, but until now no integrated approach for analysing and evaluating complex configurations in a cyber-physical systems manner is available. \n\nThe lack of system validation approaches for Smart Grids is especially addressed by ERIGrid. By providing a Pan-European research infrastructure ERIGrid supports the technology development as well as the roll out of Smart Grid solutions and concepts in Europe. It tackles a holistic, cyber-physical systems based approach by integrating 18 European research centres and institutions with outstanding research infrastructures and jointly develops common methods, concepts, and procedures. ERIGrid also integrates and enhances the necessary research services for analysing, validating and testing Smart Grid configurations. System level support and education for industrial and academic researchers in is provided as well to foster future innovation. \n\nERIGrid addresses these challenging aims by providing a single entry point to the provided research infrastructure and offering a broad spectrum of services to researchers active in Smart Grids.

{"text":"Title: FOL - Fighting Over Land: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Colombia Abstract: This proposal aims to develop a research agenda on the long-term effect on civil conflict on institutions, particularly on land tenure structure. I start by building a theoretical model to establish the mechanisms and incentives through which actors involved in an armed conflict may be interested on fighting over the control and property rights of rural land. The resulting theoretical hypotheses will be tested using a truly unique, plot-level census data set that I digitised from Official Archives of the province of Antioquia, a Colombian region highly exposed to violence over the last fifty years. This dataset contains plot-level census data collected in 1950-55 for tax purposes. Additionally, I utilise similar plot-level census data for 1995 and 2000. These historical data sets can be easily matched to current cadastral information, available from 2006 onward. Hence, I will have comparable plot-level census datasets from Antioquia for four different periods, which coincide with the main shift of the intensity and expansion of the Colombian conflict. The exogenous nature of the different episodes of the conflict will provide the spatial and temporal variation to identify the effect of violence on land tenure. Several concerns might arise about the potential non-randomness of violence. While I cannot entirely resolve these (i.e. war is not random), I propose different strategies to test the robustness of my results. The contribution of this proposal is twofold. First, this proposal will contribute to the literature on land related conflict and the social consequences of conflict. Second, I provide technical support to many land restitution policies launched in post-conflict settings.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: CureCN - Adeno-Associated Virus Vector-Mediated Liver Gene Therapy for Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Abstract: Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CN) is a rare recessive disorder caused by mutations in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1(UGT1A1) gene. CN is a life-threatening disease with no cure which constitutes a severe burden for the patients, their families, and the society. CureCN has the objective of developing a curative gene therapy for CN syndrome based on liver gene transfer with and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing the UGT1A1 transgene. Additional goals of CureCN are to develop strategies to allow for vector re-administration and to address the issue of pre-existing anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which prevent large proportion of seropositive patients from receiving AAV mediated gene therapy. Proof-of-concept studies of AAV8-UGT1A1 gene transfer provide a strong rationale for the safety and efficacy of gene therapy for CN. CureCN proposes to carry out an open-label, multicenter clinical trial of AAV8-UGT1A1 gene transfer to prove the safety and efficacy of the therapy in severe CN patients, and file for marketing authorization in Europe at the end of the study. CureCN will also produce enabling data for the clinical translation of a groundbreaking immunomodulatory strategy to allow for vector administration. Additionally, a technology for the selective removal of anti-AAV NAbs from the bloodstream of seropositive patients will be developed. The goal of these studies is to ultimately allow all CN patients to access AAV8-UGT1A1 gene therapy. CureCN is a patient-driven initiative that gathers top clinicians and scientists; it also includes small medium enterprises in its partners, to foster economic growth and valorization of intellectual property. CureCN sets itself in the ambitious goal set by the IRDiRC by 2020 by developing a curative treatment for CN syndrome. Importantly, it validates technologies that will broaden the scope of gene therapy, thus will have an impact on the development of treatments for several other rare diseases.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: INFL - New perspectives on inflation Abstract: The research in this proposal will contribute to our knowledge of the dynamics and effects of inflation through the perspective of risk-adjusted inflation and valuation formulas. The goal is to provide new perspectives on inflation and its impact on\nresource constraints.\n\nThe first step in this work is to collect new data on inflation options and use them to construct marginal densities for risk-neutral inflation at different horizons. Because there are data for both cumulative and annual inflation, I propose a new non-parametric estimator of the joint distribution of inflation. This provides a new take on inflation dynamics and the anchoring of inflation expectations.\n\nThe second step is to use these densities as discount factors to price nominal claims. Applying these to the assets and liabilities of a central bank gives a measure of the fiscal capacity of the central bank and the impact of a higher inflation target.\n\nThe third step combines the densities for inflation with nominal interest rates to gauge how much society dislikes inflation. The risk-neutral densities give inflation strips that reveal how much markets would be willing to pay to eliminate inflation risk.\n\nThe fourth step is to design inflation-indexed bonds that allow countries to self-insure in a currency union. Understanding how the value and payments of these bonds changes with different measure of inflation, a country can insure itself against some of the shocks that affect its real exchange rate.\n\nThe fifth step is to design new liabilities of the central bank that allow for a better control of inflation. By issuing inflation-indexed reverses and maintaining the commitment to redeem them one-to-one for currency at all date, the central bank can control inflation. \n\nAll together, these different projects aim to deepen our understanding of inflation, by focusing on modeling risk-adjusted inflation, to answer old questions and suggest new approaches in monetary economics.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

ER antagonists are routinely used for treatment, but significant variability exists in clinical response. We are interested in explaining this heterogeneity and exploiting the mechanistic insight. We have recently identified important, but previously uncharacterised cross-talk between ER and the progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) pathways, both of which are commonly expressed in ER+ tumours. Recently, ER has been shown to be mutated in ~18-55% of metastatic breast cancers. In addition, two key ER-chromatin regulatory proteins, FoxA1 and GATA3, are mutated in primary ER+ disease. Finally we have discovered three previously unknown phosphorylation events on FoxA1. \n\nAim 1: We will comprehensively explore the cross-talk that exists between ER and PR and AR pathways to determine the physiological effects on ER function. Aim 2: We will recapitulate the key mutations observed in ER, FoxA1 and GATA3, to assess the impact on ER-DNA interactions, ER transcriptional activity and cell growth and drug response. This will be explored under different hormonal contexts to identify how the mutational spectrum influences the cross-talk between ER and the parallel PR and AR pathways. Aim 3: We will identify upstream kinase pathways that influence FoxA1 and GATA3 function. Aim 4: We will establish a novel single locus chromatin purification method for isolation of specific chromatin loci, followed by Mass Spectrometry to characterise the potential role of PR and AR variants and to identify unknown regulatory factors. \n\nGiven recent biological discoveries and technological advances, we are perfectly positioned to apply cutting-edge tools to glean mechanistic insight into the factors that determine variability within ER+ disease.

Building Automation (BA) systems, as compared to CR, can result in medium energy use reductions and in low or medium harvesting from RES at the expense of medium installation costs and medium operational costs. Recently, the concept of Adaptable\/Dynamic Building Envelopes (ADBE) - such as Multifunctional Fa\u00e7ade Modules - has been proposed towards overcoming many of the shortcomings of CR and BA. ADBE systems can result in high energy use reductions and high harvesting from RES at the expense of medium-to-high installation costs and medium operational costs. The main strategic goal of the PLUG-N-HARVEST proposal is to design, develop, demonstrate and exploit a new modular, plug-n-play concept\/product for ADBE - deployable to both residential and non-residential buildings - which is able to provide high (maximum possible) energy use reductions and high (maximum possible) energy harvesting from RES both at the single-building and the district scale while requiring medium-to-low installation costs and almost-zero operational costs.

{"text":"Title: SPENG - Stretchable Piezoelectric Nanogenerators for Energy Harvesting in Elastic Environments Abstract: Nanoscale piezoelectric (PZ) energy harvesters, or nanogenerators (NGs), are vital for next-generation autonomous devices as they can directly convert small-scale vibrations, such as blood flow and body movements, into electrical energy. Scavenging power from ubiquitous vibrations in this way offers an attractive route to supersede fixed power sources such as batteries that need constant replacing\/recharging. In particular, epidermal or implantable PZ NGs could revolutionize wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring. The associated elastic environments require not only flexibility of the NG, but also stretchability in order for it to remain operational. Current NGs are rarely functional without being coupled to rigid or, at best, flexible substrates, due to the lack of proper methodology for fabrication of both stretchable electrodes as well as stretchable high performance PZ nanomaterials, that together make up PZ NGs. Thus, the Action aims to (i) develop micro\/nano-patterned electrode fabrication techniques based on electronic printing on flexible\/stretchable substrates, (ii) develop polymer-based PZ materials with tailored elastic properties to satisfy stretchability and flexibility criteria, marking a departure from traditional PZ materials that are ceramic in nature and hence stiff and brittle, and (iii) study the efficiency of the stretchable NGs developed, based on simulations and direct measurements of energy harvesting (EH) performance in elastic environments. The Action will address pressing EH challenges such as scalability and cost of fabrication of stretchable NGs, and enhancement of energy conversion efficiency over a wide range of deformation scenarios, with an aim to broaden the application of NGs to EH in biological and other extreme environments. The Action will be implemented in a multidisciplinary and innovative research environment at the University of Cambridge, with unique opportunities for the applicant to further his academic career.","gt":false,"conf":0.6}

Abstract: Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging dramatically improves upon conventional bio-optic barriers and enables three-dimensional, high-resolution optical imaging deep inside tissues (several mm to cm). Clinical optoacoustic macroscopy has been supported by two ERC Advanced Awards (2008, 2016; Prof. Ntziachristos). In parallel, under the ICT program INNODERM, we developed mesoscopic optoacoustic imaging for dermatology diagnostics. Termed raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM), the method can image previously invisible \u2776 pathophysiological\/oxygenation and \u2777 morphological features of the skin at depths of 1-5mm. RSOM has already shown clinical diagnostic value in dermatology and, fuelled by INNODERM, has been commercialised and globally placed by iThera Medical. \nWINTHER builds on this success. While INNODERM focused on diagnostic dermatology, it has become apparent that RSOM can also assess progression and therapy not only in skin but also in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. However, to achieve this, RSOM should be able to assess endothelial function, ability that it is not yet available. WINTHER will build next-generation fast RSOM (F-RSOM), operating up to two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art RSOM, enabling it to assess not only \u2776,\u2777 above but also \u2778 endothelial function. Using the skin as a window for disease assessment and aided by a modern computation framework, based on deterministic and artificial intelligence algorithms, F-RSOM aims to improve the clinical accuracy of RSOM and shift the paradigm in therapeutic monitoring of cardio-metabolic diseases and inflammatory skin conditions, strengthening Europe's leadership in photonics and in personalized medicine. \nThe project is driven iThera Medical with a strong history of commercializing optoacoustics for clinical applications, by leading physicians (TUM, HUNIMED), and by RSOM, RSOM components and data analysis experts (TUM, iThera, Rayfos, Sonaxis).","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

These will include: high accuracy calibrated time transfer to a monitored and certified remote time stamping.\nNine different time services are proposed for demonstration by consortium partners. These will be established at INRIM premises for two validation test campaigns: a closed loop test, aiming to validate the performances and the second test will be with user terminals located in a real user environment, integrated into the user application to test the real advantages and feasibility of the new proposed services. Envisaged end users are telecoms, power transmission, banks, and TV broadcasting networks. The DEMETRA partnership, including Scientific Institutions, GNSS Industries, and a service provider cover the different facets of the project, including an analysis of commercial potential in terms of market and business development.\nDEMETRA fits perfectly the objectives of the work program in relation to: innovation, demonstration of pilot applications, use of EGNOS and Galileo Early Services, intention to commercialise the developed service, certification, legal and societal acceptance fostering EGNSS adoption and Long term potential to set common standards in the field of GNSS applications.\nThe proposed services could become the basis for European timing standards, facilitating the independence from GPS for the timing of critical European infrastructure and fostering the dissemination through Europe of common standardised time services, based on EGNSS.","gt":false,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: Revolution - Regulation and Evolution of C4 photosynthesis Abstract: Life is dependent on sugars made during photosynthesis. When plants colonized land ~450 million years ago they used a photosynthetic system known as the C3 pathway that still operates in the majority of species today. However, from ~30 million years ago over sixty plant lineages evolved a version of photosynthesis known as the C4 pathway that increases CO2 fixation efficiency by about 50%. C4 species such as maize and sorghum are now the most productive on the planet and achieve this by compartmentalizing gene expression between cell-types.\n\nAs with other complex biological systems made up of multiple distinct cell-types, it has not been possible to understand how photosynthesis genes are regulated in specific cell-types of C4 leaves. In contrast to strategies being used by other groups, I propose to discover how specific cell-types of ancestral C3 leaves regulate gene expression, and then to use this information to determine how C4 photosynthesis operates. To achieve this, state-of-the-art approaches used on whole tissues will be adapted to study individual cell-types.\n\nRevolution will test the hypothesis that cell-specific gene expression in C4 leaves is mediated by pre-existing regulatory networks found in C3 species. Intracellular mechanisms regulating photosynthesis genes in ancestral C3 but also derived C4 leaves will be identified. In C3 leaves I wish to understand how some cell-types express photosynthesis genes whilst others remain photosynthetically repressed. In C4 leaves I wish to discover the extent to which cell-specific expression is based upon pre-existing regulatory networks in the C3 leaf.\n\nRevolution will therefore generate information of broad relevance to understanding gene expression in eukaryotes, and provide insight into mechanisms underpinning one of the major evolutionary transitions since plants moved to land.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Now the time has come to push the LC applications further by implementing them into novel polariton devices to control topological properties of light. TopoLight deals for the first time with non-linear effects in room temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and topological states of light uncovering astonishing possibilities of external electrical control over spin-orbit interaction due to artificially engineered fields acting on photons. With a two main technological approaches: originating from solid-state physics and developing molecular control of LC devices, we aim to demonstrate novel systems of tunable topological emitters based on room temperature BEC substantial in topological photonics and information encoding.\n\nWe will design, fabricate and investigate photonic structures to start an innovative integrated hybrid organic\/liquid-crystal system for room temperature BEC research and applications. Our disruptive innovation is based on the idea of external electrical control over spin-orbit coupling due to artificially engineered fields acting on photons, which has never been realised in photonics. We will create topologically protected states of light: unidirectional flow robust against backscattering and vortex states carrying quantised angular momentum. We will utilise the strong non-linearities observed in organic microcavities and SOC in liquid-crystal cavities to the demonstrate single photon polarisation switches capable for ternary logic. Our OLC microcavities (MCs) platform will combine a strong emissivity with the ease of fabrication, low costs, and scalability and room temperature operation.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: Acoutect - A sound fundament for our future buildings Abstract: To ensure a healthy environment for people living and working in buildings, research and engineering in the area of building acoustics is essential. Developments in modern building concepts, such as sustainable low-energy consuming buildings, buildings with lightweight materials and open plan working environments, as well as the need to build in extremely noisy areas, require involvement of acoustic experts in order to successfully (re)design buildings without negatively impacting upon people\u2019s health and well-being. Taking up current and future acoustic challenges requires innovative solutions based on a thorough understanding and mastering of modern methods and tools, as well as a holistic acoustic approach involving acoustic design, products and subjective evaluation. However, in the complex field of building acoustics, research activities typically are not holistic and have become slightly marginalised. As a consequence, there is a lack of building acoustics experts.\nTo meet the future acoustic needs of the built environment, Acoutect is constructed around two objectives: 1) Establish a long-lasting European-wide training programme on building acoustics, 2) Launch an innovative research programme. With these objectives, Acoutect will equip ESRs with skills to ensure acoustic quality of modern and future building concepts, and with excellent perspectives for a career in industry or academia within the area of building acoustics. The training and supervision to reach these objectives is offered by the Acoutect consortium composed of 5 academic and 7 non-academic participants. This consortium comprises various disciplines and sectors within building acoustics and beyond, promoting intersectoral, interdisciplinary and innovative training and mobility of the researchers within the project.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

This title emerged in several Arab states in the process of post-Ottoman nation-building, and represents a common trend toward the articulation of \u2018religion\u2019 as a social category distinct from the implicitly \u2018non-religious\u2019. Ottoman muftis had been legal scholars serving the courts and society at large, and muftis have been studied ever since through a classical lens of scholarly knowledge production. Yet the creation of new offices of \u2018Grand Mufti\u2019 in successor states has radically reformulated their function. For the first time in Islamic history, Middle Eastern states have generated centralised religious hierarchies in which a Grand Mufti administers a professionalised \u2018clergy\u2019 and a nationwide network of mosques, schools, cemeteries and other properties defined as religious.

{"text":"Title: CYPNASH - Validation of a novel class of cyclophilin inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Abstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly prevalent chronic liver disease (3-4% of the US population) for which there is currently no approved drug therapy. In the absence of innovative treatments healthcare costs associated with this disease are set to triple over the next decade. To address this unmet medical need, the pharmaceutical industry is currently pursuing a range of liver fibrosis drug discovery programs based on different mode of actions. A compelling mechanism for treating liver damage is pharmacological modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in liver cells via inhibition of the protein cyclophilin D. However existing cyclophilin inhibitors based on peptidic macrocyclic scaffolds are challenging to optimize into sub-type selective orally bioavailable agents suitable for clinical trials of liver fibrosis. \n\nAs part of basic research activities undertaken during ERC StG EBDD to validate a computational-biophysical drug discovery platform, we have discovered a structurally novel family of small molecules that inhibit cyclophilins by targeting a previously unexplored binding pocket. The objective of this POC is to identify a lead compound in this family with potential for development towards a NASH clinical candidate. Such a candidate will form the basis of follow-on lead optimisation programs pursued via partnering or out-licensing with a pharmaceutical partner. The activities of this POC will focus on assembling a data package of in vitro DMPK, in vivo PK, in vitro sub-type selectivity and in vitro and in vivo efficacy measurements in relevant cellular and animal models of liver fibrosis. This POC has been designed in consultation with a major pharmaceutical company and assembles a team of physical and biological scientists and business development executives to maximize the likelihood of delivering a valuable preclinical NASH asset.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The ambitious objective is to create the fundamental tools to study, and to begin to write, the history of the subject communities of Norman Sicily from the bottom up, using documentary rather than narrative sources, and illustrating as far as possible the full variety in space and time.\nThe Project will do this by making new critical editions of all of the administrative and legal documents for Norman Sicily, in the three principal administrative languages \u2014 Arabic, Greek and Latin. These texts will populate a database, to which further data from the non-documentary sources will be added. The database will then be used to generate a series of powerful electronic research tools, which will be both the means to meet the ends of this particular project, and ends in themselves that will revolutionise the future study of all aspects of the history of Norman Sicily. At the end of the Project, a series of summative studies will document, analyse and discuss different aspects of coexistence and popular multiculturalism in Norman Sicily, and set the case of Sicily in the wider Mediterranean context.\nWhat is distinctive about this Project is that not only the publication of its research objectives, but also the tools that it will create in order to achieve them, will revolutionise the future study of all aspects of the cultural, economic and social history of Norman Sicily.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: MsgRNA - Modification of single guide (sg) RNA in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing Tool Abstract: CRISPR\/Cas9 has been extensively studied for genome editing, but its therapeutic application has been hampered by off-target effects. Site-specific modification of single guide (sg) RNA in CRISPR system is a potential means to expand the utility of CRISPR-Cas genome editing. To address this, and reduce of synthetic burden of sgRNA we propose a \u2018click\u2019 ligation method to synthesize sgRNA where two chemically modified oligonucleotides are joined together using CuAAC chemistry. The resultant artificial linkage is biomimetic, so it should not affect Cas9 activity. This method offers significantly higher DNA-targeting specificity (i.e. less off-target effects) and most importantly provides a cost-effective means to access thousands of synthetic sgRNAs. Imaging in CRISPR-Cas9 system using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes have enabled significant advancements in understanding genomic structure and transcriptional control. We will explore novel approaches to image CRISPR-Cas9 system using fluorophore-quencher pairs. The activation of fluorescence can be performed upon nuclear localisation using RNase H, and upon sgRNA binding to the target DNA. These methods will provide highly fluorescent sgRNAs for live-cell imaging, potentially much brighter compared to other methods. To control CRISPR off-target effects we will also design a light induced DNA damage method where cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside or psolaren will be incorporated in the DNA-targeting RNA. Therefore, modification of sgRNA for CRISPR system can be used to address the biological limitations of CRISPR and expand its functionality. This will open up many avenues for future development and lead to more application-focused studies on therapeutic gene editing.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: EVOIMMECH - The evolutionary ecology of bacterial immune mechanisms Abstract: Bacteria have a range of immune mechanisms, but it is unclear why this diverse armamentarium evolved. The most important immune mechanisms are (1) Surface Modification (SM) (2) Abortive infection (Abi) (3) Restriction Modification (R-M) (4) CRISPR-Cas and (5) prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo), all of which can occur as stand-alone mechanisms or in combination. The individual mechanisms differ in key aspects, such as their fitness costs (constitutive versus inducible), specificity (indiscriminate versus specific), the recipient of the benefits (individual versus group), the speed of de novo resistance evolution (rapid versus slow), and heritability of immunity. Here I will take a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to tease apart the variables that drive the evolution of these diverse stand-alone and integrated bacterial immune strategies in nature, and examine their associated co-evolutionary dynamics. I focus on three ecological variables that are consistently important in host-symbiont co-evolution: (1) force of infection (2) spatial structure (3) presence of mutualists (plasmids). First, I will perform in vitro manipulations using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 variants that carry either single or multiple immune mechanisms. Next, I will sequence metagenomes, transcriptomes and viromes of microbial communities from environments that differ in ecological variables that are important in vitro, to examine their importance in vivo. Key ecological mechanisms identified in the first two parts of the project will be used to guide mesocosm experiments to experimentally confirm that these mechanisms are the drivers of the observed patterns of resistance and co-evolution in nature.

A curious phenomenon has simultaneously occurred in contemporary art, as artists located around the world have turned to humorous aesthetic strategies in order to document and re-assess global politics, experiences of crisis and collective trauma. In spite of this turn, and although the politics of humour has attracted recent attention, leading scholars across the social sciences and humanities continually lament the lack of scholarly analysis on the subject. In this context, the main objectives of LIAE are 1) to develop a conceptual framework and gather empirical information to account for the impetus behind the emergence of humour in art from contemporary sites of \u2018crisis\u2019; 2) to develop a novel framework of how humour advances the social function of art by operating as a vital agent of cultural resilience in three keys ways: re-enforcing connection to place, coalescing collective identity, and by subverting oppressive authority structures; 3) to develop a conceptual framework that accounts for how \u2018high art\u2019 settings radically differs to that of \u2018viral\u2019 or \u2018demotic\u2019 forms (cartoons, memes and street art).

The three phases of water operating in Earth's present climate provide the archetype for condensible processes in climate dynamics, but the dawning age of exoplanet discovery and characterization requires that the understanding of phase change effects be expanded far beyond the situations familiar from the study of Earth's climate, or indeed of the climate of any Solar System planet.  The goal of this project is to pioneer the advances needed to understand condensible climate dynamics for the vastly broader range of condensible substances, thermodynamic and planetary configurations presented by the growing catalogue of exoplanets.  The emphasis will be on the smaller range of planets (super-Earth to Earth mass or size class), which need not have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and therefore present a richer and highly challenging variety of possible condensible behavior. This class of planets includes all planets that are potentially habitable for Earthlike life, but even planets that are far from habitable shed light on essential features of planets in the Universe, and will be studied. The work will embrace both small scale buoyancy-driven turbulent convection and planetary scale circulations. Idealized numerical simulations, buttressed by theoretical analysis will be employed. Particular emphasis will be put on aspects of exoclimate that are amenable to probing by current observations and improved observational techniques likely to become available in the coming decade.

However, the processes that shape the architecture of these systems are still not understood. By 2021 the GAIA mission will provide astrometric+radial velocity orbits for millions of multiple systems. For the vast majority, GAIA will measure only photocenter displacements and not be able to resolve the individual components, preventing masses and orbital statistics to be derived.  The aim of the GAIA-BIFROST project is to exploit the GAIA sample in order to identify the processes that govern the formation and dynamical evolution of binaries and planetary systems. Using VLTI+CHARA interferometry we will resolve up to \u223c6000 GAIA binaries in the continuum and in spectral lines, allowing us: (a) to derive precision dynamical masses, ages, and comprehensive orbital parameter statistics that is needed to discern between different binary formation scenarios; (b) to measure the spin-orbit and spin-spin alignment for hundreds of GAIA star-star and star-planet systems. This will constrain the origin of the orbit obliquity for stars and planets, providing unique information about their formation process and dynamical history; and (c) to image companion-disk interactions in young binary systems and use them as benchmark for studying the hydrodynamical processes that determine the system architecture at formation.  Furthermore, our survey will provide a legacy data set of dynamical masses and precision ages for (literally!) thousands of stars, by far exceeding all earlier work in these areas. This will impact many areas of modern astrophysics, including studies on stellar evolution and Galactic Archaeology.

For all cities achieving this level of impact is an extraordinary undertaking and would require profound changes in how policies, projects and programmes are advanced by cities, with the direction and support of senior governments. NZC connects and builds beyond established programmes and experimental initiatives.\nThe NetZeroCities consortium is build based on partners? expertise, experience, and access to a very large network of cities of all sizes and maturity throughout Europe. It has an excellent balance of partner typologies, a great geographical coverage allowing presence and activity all throughout Europe, and thanks to that, its approach goes beyond current state-of-the-art.\nNetZeroCities will create a programme tailored to the specific conditions of each city. All the services and thematic expertise will be aggregated and co-designed through a NZC one-stop-shop Platform and the digital portal and smart repository for impact measurement, capacity building and knowledge\/tools dissemination. Cities will benefit from an intensive support relationship of dedicated City Guides to navigate the platform and ensure city needs are adequately understood and addressed. \nNetZeroCities will support pilots in 30 European cities and, in subsequent rounds of engagement, more than 100 cities to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 (medium-term) and 2050 (long term) respectively, by developing and deploying an integral approach to support climate-neutral transformation in cities. This will be achieved through the co-design and organisation of services, including the Climate-neutral City Contract as an enabling instrument.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Making the infrastructures \u201csmarter\u201d usually means making them smarter in normal operation and use: more adaptive, more intelligent\u2026 But will these smart critical infrastructures (SCIs) behave equally \u201csmartly\u201d and be \u201csmartly resilient\u201d also when exposed to extreme threats, such as extreme weather disasters or terrorist attacks? If making existing infrastructure \u201csmarter\u201d is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover?\nThese are the main questions tackled by this proposal.\nThe proposal envisages answering the above questions in several steps. (#1) By identifying existing indicators suitable for assessing resilience of SCIs. (#2) By identifying new \u201csmart\u201d resilience indicators (RIs) \u2013 including those from Big Data. (#3) By developing a new advanced resilience assessment methodology (TRL4) based on smart RIs (\u201cresilience indicators cube\u201d, including the resilience matrix). (#4) By developing the interactive \u201cSCI Dashboard\u201d tool. (#5) By applying the methodology\/tools in 8 case studies, integrated under one virtual, smart-city-like, European case study. The SCIs considered (in 8 European countries!) deal with energy, transportation, health, water\u2026\nResults #2, #3, #4 and #5 are a breakthrough innovation.\nThis approach will allow benchmarking the best-practice solutions and identifying the early warnings, improving resilience of SCIs against new threats and cascading and ripple effects.

{"text":"Title: MiroMigration - Miro dependent mitochondrial dynamics and the regulation of neuronal migration Abstract: Regulated trafficking of mitochondria is essential for providing ATP at the correct spatial location to power neural computation, and for providing Ca2+ buffering at sites of Ca2+ entry or release. In neurons, the concentration of mitochondria in specific regions such as growth cones and synapses is important for correct neuronal function and development. Consequently, defective mitochondrial trafficking is increasingly implicated in neurological diseases. Very little is known regarding the role of mitochondrial positioning and function during neural development such as during the migration of cortical neurons. This proposal will study the mechanisms that control the trafficking of mitochondria in neurons and how this regulates neuronal migration during cortex development. Using imaging, molecular techniques, combined with ex vivo or in utero electroporation and mouse transgenic models I will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the signalling-dependent positioning of mitochondria in migrating neuronal progenitors. I will examine how the mitochondrial Ca2+-sensing GTPase Miro1 acts as a molecular switch to regulate mitochondrial positioning and function. How Miro1-mediated mitochondrial trafficking regulates neuronal migration in brain development will also be determined. A key goal will be to determine the role of Miro1 Ca2+-sensing and GTPase domains and other components of the Miro1 protein complex including CENPF, DISC1 and Nde1 in the control of mitochondrial positioning in these processes. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control mitochondrial signalling-dependent localization in regulating neuronal development. Moreover, understanding these processes may highlight novel therapeutic approaches for neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, schizophrenia and intellectual disability, where disrupted neuronal migration and cortical wiring are thought to occur.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

It will provide direct payoffs to both, tissue engineering and single-cell genomics fields. The overarching goal is to build a set of statistically rigorous and consistent probabilistic models for aligning a single-cell transcriptomic profile of an organoid against its in vivo tissue, for quantitatively evaluating its recapitulatory power. \n\nDuring the course of this action, a meticulous review will be conducted on the state-of-the-art single-cell data modelling and comparative analysis techniques prior to formulating the single-cell transcriptomic profile comparison problem in statistical learning theory. This will specifically focus on both cell clustering and cell trajectory inference methods. A new statistical framework will be implemented to accommodate a comprehensive comparison between a pair of in vitro and in vivo transcriptomic profiles. A rigorous scoring measure will be devised to quantify their alignment. \n\nOverall, the inference components under the proposed framework will facilitate the prediction of missing or outlying cellular attributes, transcriptional factors and signaling pathways in organoids compared to their in vivo tissues, informing directions of organoid protocol improvement.

{"text":"Title: TRANSNATIONALaw - Transnationalism and Unofficial Law: The Case of Kurds in Turkey and Germany Abstract: The use of multiple legal practices based on diverse normative perceptions increasingly challenges the monopoly of state law. In Europe, this issue has become especially visible in the ongoing discussions about sharia courts. However, there is only limited research about the practical implications of non-state legal orders, particularly in relation to their effects on women\u2019s rights and gender relations. The proposed research aims to start filling this gap by investigating the non-state justice systems operating in Berlin, the city with the largest Kurdish population in Europe, and Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish-dominated city in Turkey. An evidence-based foundation is needed if the legal order and conceptualizations of citizenship are to be fit for increasingly diverse societies. In-depth interviews and participant observation will be used to investigate when, why and how Kurdish communities in Diyarbak\u0131r and Berlin choose alternative dispute resolution over the official court procedures provided by the state. There will be a special focus on family cases to examine how gender norms and relations are affected by the use of non-state judicial processes. A historical perspective on the Diyarbakir-based \u2018unofficial\u2019 legal order will explore the non-European and non-religious roots of unofficial dispute resolution practices used within Europe. The transnational perspective will also enable an investigation of the mutual influences across non-state and state legal orders in Europe and the Middle East.

{"text":"Title: SmartLube - Surface functionalized-MoS2 nanofluids as high temperature lubricant additives Abstract: There is an increasing and urgent need in Europe and globally for effective and robust high temperature (HT) lubricant additives in critical industrial applications. Combining synergistically the exceptional oil solubility of organic polymers and the excellent tribological behaviour of MoS2 nanoparticles (NPs), polymer functionalized-MoS2 NPs with good dispersion stability will be designed and synthesized as candidates for HT lubricant additives. In addition, to suppress MoS2 oxidation under HT, which would cause high friction and wear, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) will be covalently combined with MoS2 NPs to improve the retention of MoS2 on the frictional surfaces and prevent oxidation during rubbing. In this project, MoS2 NPs will be functionalized by two methods: 1) Immobilization of organic polymer on the surface of MoS2 NPs using non-covalent and covalent approaches. The organic polymers including oil-soluble poly-(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA), polyalkylene glycol (PEG), and hyperbranched poly(3-ethyl-3-hydroxymethyloxetane) PEHO; 2) MoS2 NPs growing on the surface of organic polymer modified-CNMs with covalent bonds. The polymers connecting CNMs and MoS2 NPs are novel PEHO and PEG derivatives with lipoic acid (LA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) terminals. The properties of the grafted polymers on MoS2 NPs and CNMs will be analyzed. The dispersion stability of surface functionalization MoS2 NPs will be assessed by SAXS\/SANS, as well as cryo-TEM, SEM, DLS, and \u03be- potential measurements. The surface force apparatus (SFA) will be used for mechanistic understanding of how such NPs mediate friction, with the macroscopic HT tribological properties of the NP dispersions investigated using tribometer. The correlation between the NP physicochemical properties and their efficacy in lubrication will be assessed. The wear mechanism of surface functionalized-MoS2 NPs as friction reduction and antiwear (AW) additives in lubricating oils will be explored by XPS and SEM-EDS.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: EvoConBiO - Uncovering and engineering the principles governing evolution and cellular control of bioenergetic organelles Abstract: \"Complex life on Earth is powered by bioenergetic organelles -- mitochondria and chloroplasts. Originally independent organisms, these organelles have retained their own genomes (mtDNA and cpDNA), which have been dramatically reduced through evolutionary history. Organelle genomes form dynamic populations within present-day eukaryotic cells, akin to individuals co-evolving in a \"\"cellular ecosystem\"\". The structure of these populations is central to eukaryotic life. However, the processes shaping the content of these genomes through history, and maintaining their integrity in modern organisms, are poorly understood. This challenges our understanding of eukaryotic evolution and our ability to design rational strategies to engineer bioenergetic performance.\n\nEvoConBiO will address these questions using a unique and unprecedented interdisciplinary approach, combining experimental characterisation and manipulation of organelle genomes with mathematical modelling and cutting-edge statistics. This highly novel combination of experiment and theory will drive the field in a new direction, for the first time uncovering the universal principles underlying the evolution and cellular control of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Our groundbreaking recent work on mtDNA suggests a common tension underlying organelle evolution, between genetic robustness (transferring genes to the nucleus) and the control and maintenance of organelles (retaining genes in organelles). EvoConBiO will reveal the pathways underlying organelle evolution, why organisms adapt to different points on these pathways, and how they resolve this underlying tension. In addition to these \"\"blue sky\"\" scientific insights into a process of central evolutionary importance, we will harness our findings to \"\"learn from evolution\"\" in high-risk high-reward development of new experimental strategies to engineer chloroplast performance in plants and algae of importance in EU agriculture, biofuel production, and bioengineering.\"","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: Exile and Technology - Austro-German exile in America 1930-45: interrogating the relationship between science, technology and modern selfhood in cultural and musical discourses. Abstract: This project examines the relationship between technology, selfhood, and modernity in the context of the music and thought of Austrian and German \u00e9migr\u00e9 musicians and cultural theorists in America from 1930 to 1945. The project looks beyond the boundaries of the nation state and the nexus of composer and musical work that tend to structure musicological enquiry. Instead, transnational historical methodologies will be used alongside primary archival research to join a timely conversation in musicology about the intersections between histories of music and science. In the era 1930-45, (Austro-)Germany and America were scientific powerhouses. Against the backdrop of mounting political turmoil, both generated ethically controversial scientific and technological research simultaneously liberating and malevolent: atomic technology, cosmology, radar, eugenics, transportation innovations. Technology necessarily shapes ideas of selfhood, and the mass displacement of Austrian and German intellectuals to the US after the rise of the National Socialists created a \u2018culture of exile\u2019 in which, as \u00e9migr\u00e9s integrated within the new context, diverse attitudes to the relationship between science, technology, and formulations of the self began to interweave. Using musical collaborations, spectacles, and events to illuminate and explore the range and ambivalence of those attitudes, the project will furnish a more finely grained historical understanding of the disconnections between Germanic and American relationships to technology and selfhood in the period. The research outcomes during the fellowship will be a monograph, and two articles as part of substantial work on a second book.

Today Climate Services can benefit from an unprecedented availability of data, in particular from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, and from recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to exploit the full potential of these data. The main objective of CLINT is the development of an AI framework composed of Machine Learning (ML) techniques and algorithms to process big climate datasets for improving Climate Science in the detection, causation and attribution of Extreme Events, including tropical cyclones, heatwaves and warm nights, and extreme droughts, along with compound events and concurrent extremes. Specifically, the framework will support (1) the detection of spatial and temporal patterns, and evolutions of climatological fields associated with Extreme Events, (2) the validation of the physically based nature of causality discovered by ML algorithms, and (3) the attribution of past and future Extreme Events to emissions of greenhouse gases and other anthropogenic forcing.

At the same time, significant contaminated land areas remain unused.  \nCERESiS aims to provide a win-win sustainable solution to both issues by facilitating land decontamination through phytoremediation, growing energy crops to produce clean biofuels. In the longer term, this will increase the land available for agriculture, while producing non-ILUC biofuel.\nThe project is based on three pillars. The phytoremediation pillar will identify a range of promising energy crops, focusing on key contaminants worldwide. They will be trialed in North, South, Eastern Europe and Brazil, with samples characterised and converted to biofuels. \nThe technological pillar will optimize two clean biofuel conversion technologies, Supercritical Water Gasification & Fast Pyrolysis integrated with novel contaminant separation technologies, focusing on eliminating, stabilising or retrieving the contaminants in an easy to manage form. \nThe Decision Support pillar will develop an open access, modular and expandable Decision Support System able to identify optimal solutions for each application.

Whilst the EU Biodiversity Strategy aims to halt and then reverse these losses of species, data on the conservation status of many protected species is lacking, inhibiting their management. Effective conservation is reliant on robust data on protected species, yet there is a substantial knowledge gap between traditional monitoring methods that record abundances and conservation management frameworks that require the integration of species\u2019 ecology with their adaptive responses to rapidly changing environments. The primary aim of this Fellowship is to thus deliver a novel conservation management framework for a model protected species, integrating ecological and genetic data, to provide a new predictive basis for European conservation management programmes. The sea lamprey Petromyson marinus is the model species, a protected species on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive that provides multiple generations for testing the effects of environmental change on candidate genes. Research objectives quantify P. marinus European genetic diversity and structure, test for the presence of novel genetic mutations across populations, identify the genetic regions associated with adaptation to specific environmental parameters and develop an eco-evolutionary model of P. marinus population dynamics as the basis for its conservation management framework. As the project delivers highly innovative genetic and ecological research, it brings together a leading European researcher with high genetic knowledge with a European research group with exceptional expertise in conservation ecology.

However, significant challenges remain in regard to the application of optical microscopy to in vivo interrogations. First, the diffusing nature of light propagation in tissue due to random variations of the refractive index, limits in vivo microscopy to superficial depths; within only a few mean free paths (<1mm). Second the invasive nature of fluorescent proteins and probes, allows monitoring of only 1-5 events by spectrally multiplexing different fluorochromes; i.e. performance that is highly incompatible with the targets of functional genomics and proteomics.\nThis proposal aims to develop the next step in optical visualization by addressing these two fundamental limitations of optical imaging, i.e. Depth and Contrast. To achieve this, DynAMic proposes a radically new concept for optical imaging of tissue based on \u2776 developing real-time wavefront-shaping adaptive optics for making the performance of any optical system ideal and for the first time in Raman microscopy \u2777 reaching tenfold deeper in tissue than conventional optical microscopy by compensating for the refractive index variations using  phase and polarization retrieval for inversing light diffusion and \u2778 utilize advance image formation to improve the sensitivity and utilization of stimulated Raman scattering for multi-parametric label-free contrast that radically expands at least tenfold the number of labels concurrently retrieved from living systems, linking optical observation to functional proteomic requirements. \nThe new optical imaging ability delivered in DynAMic will be applied to a first target application of ophthalmic imaging, also used as a window to the brain and devastating nervous disease detection, defining the next generation ophthalmology and neurology sensing, disrupting the modus operandi of retinal imaging  without disturbing the modus agendi of the end users.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: EXACT - Identifying biomarkers of Exposure leading to Lung Cancer with Adductomics Abstract: Over 20% of death by cancer in the world are due to Lung Cancer (LC).  Tobacco, and recently, exposure to air pollution, are considered the main causes for LC, thus specific carcinogens have been only partially identified. The complex composition of tobacco smoke and air pollution makes it difficult to identify the specific compounds responsible for the carcinogenesis process. To understand the mechanisms of LC onset, methods are needed to characterize specific toxicants that people are exposed to. We propose to develop a new method to identify exposure-specific (tobacco or air pollution) markers of LC. This new method is based on the measure of the ensemble of electrophile-carcinogens and human serum albumin adducts in human serum:  the Adductome. Electrophiles present in blood are highly reactive species that have been long suspected of causing cancer because of their ability to bind DNA and proteins. Protein adducts provide more suitable markers of exposure as they have a longer life span in the blood and are present in much higher concentrations, but have been poorly investigated. In EXACT we hypothesise that protein-carcinogen electrophiles adducts can be used as markers of LC carcinogenesis and that different markers can be identified for tobacco-induced or air pollution-induced disease. Our objective is to improve the current analytical methodology for adductomics analysis and develop a new methodology for adducts structural identification in order to characterize adduct profiles in 400 samples of human serum from the EPIC cohort. Statistical analyses will be carried out to link adducts profiles to smoking status, air pollution data and methylation profiles. The elucidation of the markers structure will allow us to establish a database of candidate compounds responsible for the carcinogenicity of tobacco and air pollution.

On the other hand, we know almost nothing about how a magnetic molecule is affected by electrons flowing through it or what chemical ingredients it takes to construct perspective devices. SpinReMag will investigate these uncharted waters by exploring the boundary between chemistry and single-molecule read-out technology. SpinReMag is a strongly multidisciplinary project utilizing an innovative mix of synthetic chemistry, physics and materials methodology to overcome present experimental limitations. Our design approach is to investigate single-molecule junctions, except instead of placing a molecules between bulk electrodes, we will directly grow photoactive groups on the molecule so that electrons will flow through or close to the spin center after a light pulse. This affords an ultra-clean system that can be studied in bulk, with a perfectly defined geometry of the magnetic and electronic elements. SpinReMag will provide the fundamental ground work to explain how molecular spins interact with flowing electrons. The execution of this project will for the first time provide the understanding of fundamental spintronic processes, and open new pathways to the rational design of single-molecule spintronics.

{"text":"Title: PREDICT - A new era in personalised medicine: Radiomics as decision support tool for diagnostics and theragnostics in oncology Abstract: The high degree of tumour (genomic and phenotypic) heterogeneity influences patient\u2019s response to therapy and hampers wide deployment of personalised medicine for cancer treatment. Thus, there is an imperative need for new technologies that can accurately detect tumour heterogeneity, allow for patient stratification and assist clinicians in providing the right diagnosis and treatment for the right patient. PREDICT\u2019s mission is to address this huge unmet need.\nRadiomics, a newly emerging field that uses high-throughput extraction of large amounts of features from radiographic images, can boost the field of personalised medicine. The analysis of medical images taken as standard-of-care allows Radiomics to capture tumour heterogeneity and to generate \u2018tumour-specific\u2019 signatures in a non-invasive way, without the need of assessing the patient\u2019s genetic profile. Thus, Radiomics, if linked to Big- data and decision support systems (DSS), can be used as diagnostic tool for patient stratification, for prediction of treatment response and for guidance, involving the patient, of clinical decisions in oncology. However, researchers that understand cancer biology, advanced imaging and big data analytics are virtually absent. Even more challenging is to translate the outcomes into actual clinical tools involving the patient.\nPREDICT will train 15 highly promising researchers in the emerging field of Radiomics and Big data. These ESRs will be trained to implement the automatic exploitation of large amounts of imaging data to drive decision-making algorithms that will guide diagnosis and treatment of different types of cancer and to develop \u2018tumour-specific\u2019 signatures integrated in multifactorial DSS. The ESRs will become experts and innovators in Radiomics, Big Data and DSS, which will allow them to bring unique solutions towards the clinic. PREDICT builds upon a strong consortium with 8 academic and 10 non-academic partners that are all pioneers in their respective field.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: NextGenProteins - BIOCONVERSION OF UNDERUTILIZED RESOURCES INTO NEXT GENERATION PROTEINS FOR FOOD AND FEED Abstract: Demand for proteins is increasing for food and feed applications. To meet the increasing demand, production will have to double by 2050. However, current protein production, both animal- and vegetal based, has severe negative environmental impacts in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land and water use, as well as biodiversity loss. The EU is not self-sufficient when it comes to protein production and a large proportion of the demand is met with imported proteins with concerns regarding food security and the general competitiveness of the EU. It is therefore of vital importance to find sustainable alternative protein sources that can be economically produced in quantities that meet growing food and feed sectors. NextGenProteins has identified microalgae, single cell protein and insects as three promising sources of alternative proteins that can be produced through innovative and environmentally sustainable bioconversion processes using industrial waste streams. These processes cause limited environmental impacts and pressure on natural resources. Through collaboration between industry and RTD, the project will address key barriers that currently prohibit or limit the application of the three alternative proteins in food and feed, such as production scalability and optimisation, production costs, value chain risks, safety, regulations and consumer trust and acceptance. The project will demonstrate the suitability and economic viability of the alternative proteins in food and feed value chains and explore their market opportunities with the industry, stakeholders, policy makers and consumers. NextGenProteins will find means to improve the acceptability and trust of consumers towards alternative proteins and processes. The project will contribute to strengthening food security, sustainability and self-sufficiency of EU protein production with future-proof supply, as well as long-term reduction of land use, water use, GHG emissions and energy of EU food sector.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: ENCOUNTER - Demography, Cultural change, and the Diffusion of Rice and Millet during the Jomon-Yayoi transition in prehistoric Japan Abstract: Human history is punctuated by episodes of large-scale diffusion of new ideas and people that lead to era-defining transitions in past societies. Investigating what promotes these events, how societies react to these, and what are their long-term consequences is a key to understand the fundamental drivers of cultural change. ENCOUNTER will push forward this research agenda by investigating the Jomon-Yayoi transition, a demic and cultural diffusion event that led the predominantly hunting, gathering, and fishing-based communities of the Japanese islands to adopt rice and millet farming during the 1st millennium BC. The continental migrants who triggered this transition event did not bring just a new economy, but also new technology and culture, deeply impacting the indigenous society. The transition was however not uniform, as different regions responded to the new culture in different ways. Some immediately adopted the new cultural repertoire to its full extent, others embraced only certain elements, and still others resisted for over 1,000 years, generating cultural, linguistic and genetic clines that are still tangible today. ENCOUNTER will investigate this pivotal moment in Japanese prehistory, seeking to determine why the indigenous inhabitants responded so differently to the arrival of the new culture. It will examine the dynamics of this transition by: synthesising one of the richest archaeological records available in the world; combining new and old lines of evidence across different disciplines, including organic chemistry, palynology, and material culture studies; and developing a suite of computational techniques to reconstruct patterns of demographic change and cultural diffusion. It will question the existing narrative that farming is inevitable and instead put new emphasis on the incumbent hunter-gatherer populations to understand their motivations to change subsistence strategies with respect to their environment settings and cultural affinities.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: EvoGamesPlus - Evolutionary games and population dynamics: from theory to applications Abstract: Evolutionary game theory (EGT) was developed to model biological populations, and the early models had great success in explaining apparently paradoxical biological behaviour. Animal and human populations are complex, however, involving important factors such as social relationships, space and time. Thus whilst EGT is a great tool to conceptualize and understand real-world biological interactions, standard EGT is often too simplistic and therefore insufficient to describe the interactions at hand with a sufficient level of realism.\nThere has thus been a lot of work in developing more realistic models of populations, including by participants in this project, and this is a rapidly growing area. There is a great shortage of, and need for, highly trained and versatile researchers comfortable with the mixture of mathematical modeling, biological knowledge and expertise in computing and the analysis of data. It is rare for undergraduates to be taught all of these skills, and so a significant training focus is needed at PhD level. The development of a strong group of such researchers is at the centre of this proposal, and we have developed a training plan to give them the required expertise in the relevant areas, and their combination.\nWe will pursue 4 research themes, 2 developing methodology and 2 focused on applications. The first concerns the modelling of structured populations, incorporating more realistic spatial and social interactions. The second considers important out of equilibrium dynamical concepts, often neglected in favour of equilibria. The third focuses on the mathematical modelling of cancer and its treatment. Here the two above concepts are especially important. The fourth considers ecological and epidemiological modelling where the focus is on structural complexity relating to the interplay of different timescales and the management and analysis of epidemiological data. Whilst specialising, all ESRs will gain knowledge of all of these important themes.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Globally approximately 2.5M people suffer from it, with 420,000 newly diagnosed cases each year. In Europe, a total of 118,000 new cases and 52,000 deaths are estimated annually. With population growth and ageing, the absolute incidence of bladder cancer might be further escalating.\nDespite the increasing incidences, the current treatments remain ineffective. The gold standard Trans-Urethral Resection of Bladder Tumour (TURBT) has up to 61% risk of tumour recurrence due to incomplete removal or tumour cell implantation during the procedure.\nCML introduces U-TURBT, an innovative disposable device for the treatment of bladder cancer. By covering and sealing the portion of bladder affected by the tumour, it avoids tumour cell spillage and dissemination. By minimising the risk of recurrence, U-TURBT improves patients\u2019 health and quality of life, and cuts down the expenses of the healthcare providers relative to additional treatments.\nDuring the feasibility assessment, a go-to-market strategy and a supply chain will be established, as well as further development plan will be drafted.

By combining, novel single cell genomics techniques, CRISPR\/dCas9 technology and innovative analytical approaches, this project will uncover the links between DNA methylation, gene expression and cell fate decisions during mouse gastrulation. This information will be used in a novel way to identify methylation signatures responsible for the stable repression of pluripotency, which has great potential to advance the development of safe iPS cells.

{"text":"Title: FrEQuMP - Frequency-encoded quantum multi-photon interference devices Abstract: Optical quantum computing and quantum simulation rely on multi-photon interference effects, between many photons in a larger number of optical paths or modes. In particular in Gaussian Boson Sampling protocols, single-mode squeezed states are input to an optical circuit implementing a transformation on the modes, which creates a complex multi-mode squeezed state. Sampling from such a state with single photon detectors is thought to be an intractable problem to simulate with classical computers, and has useful applications, for instance in calculating molecular vibronic spectra and in identifying densely connected sub-graphs of a network. This motivates building quantum-optical devices to implement Gaussian Boson Sampling. However, it is resource intensive to create a usefully large state using many separate squeezed sources and a circuit, and very technically challenging to avoid photon loss and to maintain interferometric stability. Here, I propose to carry out Gaussian Boson Sampling and related experiments by directly generating multi-mode squeezed states encoded in frequency, from a single source with reconfigurable frequency correlations. Using frequency channels to represent the modes is very compact because they can all propagate along the same spatial path, and this also ensures interferometric stability. Directly generating the desired state will avoid having the photons propagate through a lossy circuit, allowing scaling to higher photon numbers, and frequency encoding will make large numbers of modes readily available, surpassing the state-of-the-art in spatially-encoded circuits.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: EYEPOD - The vision-strike conversion: Neural control of the predatory strike behavior in stomatopods Abstract: Controlling how the body is propelled through space is paramount for survival of most animals. Many species, including humans, use feedback from their visual and proprioceptive systems to correct or confirm body movements. However, feedback is limited to events that form part of the past. For many high performance behaviors, such as catching a fast incoming ball, the appropriate movement must be 1. anticipated from a short observation period and 2. actuated without sensory feedback. \n Understanding how visual information is processed and re-coded in a predictive manner for the purpose of movement implementation is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Such ballistic movements have been studied in predatory species, however previous investigations on the neural basis of such behaviour focus on the early circuits. Much less is known about the sensorimotor conversion of this behaviour. \n Here I propose to investigate the sensorimotor control of the fastest predatory strike on earth, boasted by stomatopods. This work will yield novel insights and fill the current knowledge gap on the neural basis of anticipatory and ballistic movements. As one of the few world experts in the field of stomatopod visual ecology, I am uniquely qualified to initiate this line of research. \nThis project utilizes both my expertise as a stomatopod visual ecologist and the expertise of my host supervisor, Paloma Gonzalez-Bellido, who is a leader in the use of behavioural, histological, and electrophysiological techniques to study sensorimotor conversion in predatory insects.

{"text":"Title: Q-SORT - QUANTUM SORTER Abstract: Q-SORT introduces a revolutionary concept whereby the TEM is employed as a Quantum Sorter. All TEM techniques are in fact limited to the imaging and energy spectroscopy of the electron wavefunction. Moreover, when a single sample property is sought, most of the image information is useless, a waste that cannot be afforded in dose-sensitive materials. The Quantum Sorter leverages the recently-acquired capacity to structure e-beams, which implies that if, in a quantum experiment (tunable state preparation, interaction, analysis), the analysis is performed over the \u2018optimal\u2019 basis of quantum states, very few electrons are necessary for the full characterisation of a sought property, i.e. the TEM can be tuned to answer a single question but with maximum efficiency. To this end, Q-SORT introduces a new parallel analysis strategy, based on a suitable conformal mapping of the wavefunction: the starting point is the analysis of orbital angular momentum (OAM), but building a recipe for diagonalising a wider range of observables is one of the planned Breakthroughs of Q-SORT. This will in turn allow Q-SORT to achieve three other high-risk Breakthroughs of vast applicability: assessing the OAM of plasmonic resonances in select nanoparticles, achieving atomic-resolution magnetic dichroism, identifying different proteins based on selected properties. We believe that the Quantum Sorter will become so important that it will eventually be part of every state-of-the-art TEM, since the new technology is easy to integrate with energy-loss spectrometry. The project consortium includes some of the world leaders in optical and electronic vortex beams, as well as in protein cryoTEM.

The two risks are interlinked, as the risk of wildland fires increases during periods of extreme heat and decreasing precipitation. Extreme heat increases the death and disease rates for cardiopulmonary disease (CPD). Wildland fires cause intense air pollution in the form of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3). These are the two major air pollutants threatening human health in Europe, and their main health effects are related to CPD. Episodes of extreme temperatures and extreme levels of PM2.5 and O3 are likely to occur simultaneously and could occur more often, last longer, and become more intense in a warming world. \n\nEXHAUSTION will establish exposure projections for extreme heat and air pollution based on the most updated and advanced climate modeling efforts. EXHAUSTION has access to unique retrospective health registries on CPD mortality and morbidity in Northern, Central, and Southern European settings. In addition, EXHAUSTION draws upon a large time-series data base in a multi-country observational study. These data enable us to derive novel exposure-response relationships for heat, air pollution, and CPD. By combining the exposure projections and the exposure-response relationships, EXHAUSTION quantifies the future exacerbation of CPD in European settings and attributes the change in CPD mortality to a changing climate. \n\nEXHAUSTION will develop innovative adaptation strategies informed by epidemiological evidence, and address major inequity issues by identifying how age, sex, and indicators of socio-economic status (SES) predict probability for CPD caused by extreme heat and air pollution. EXHAUSTION will model socio-economic cost estimates for the response in CPD, and identify and validate possible adaptation strategies. Cost estimates, including projected health co-benefits of future adaptive measures and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures will be established.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: SEMANTAX - Form-Independent Semantics for Natural Language Understanding Abstract: The project addresses the most important open problem in NLP, to develop a robust semantics that is invariant across different linguistic forms within a language and across languages, and embodies aspects of common-sense knowledge.  It will be derived by machine-learning from machine-reading of vast amounts of text, using an existing state-of-the-art wide-coverage CCG semantic parser developed under previous ERC funding to the PI, initially to build traditional semantic analyses of sentences relating named entities.\n\nPatterns of entailment across semantic expressions relating the same named entities will be then detected across other entities of the same types, to construct directed entailment graphs. Cliques within the graphs constitute paraphrases, and can be collapsed to a single cluster identifier.  The paraphrase-clustered entailment graph can then be used to redefine the semantics delivered by the parser as conjunctions of entailed paraphrase clusters, to make it invariant under paraphrase and common-sense entailment, yet compatible with a traditional logical operator semantics.  The semantics will be extended to a wide range of logical operators, including tense, modality, aspect, and voice, and to implicative and evidential verbs, light verbs, multi-word expressions, and idioms. The method will be applied to semantic parsing, machine translation, knowledge-graph query, and the construction of large knowledge graphs or semantic nets from text, using spreading activation to limit growth in costs of updating and querying the knowledge graph.\n\nIn the later stages of the project, the paraphrase-clustered entailment semantics will form the bassi for an incremental semantic parser, using a novel shift-reduce architecture proposed for CCG by the PI in 2000, guided by a modern neural network parsing model acting as a categorial ``supertagger'' and parser action model, for application to language modeling for the machine translation component.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: MANTEL - Management of Climatic Extreme Events in Lakes  Reservoirs for the Protection of Ecosystem Services Abstract: Environmental perturbations to lakes and reservoirs occur largely as episodic climatic events.  These range from relatively short mixing events to storms and heat waves. While the driving events occur along a continuum of frequency and magnitude, however, their effect is generally longer lasting than the events themselves. In addition, the more extreme weather events are now becoming increasingly frequent, a trend that has been linked to directional climate change and is projected to continue in the coming decades. Understanding the impact of these short-lived pressures requires monitoring that captures the event (hours\u2013days) and the ensuing impact, that can last for months or even years.  Only recently has automated high frequency monitoring (HFM) of lakes been adopted throughout Europe. This Training Network will investigate the effects of the most extreme events, and of cumulative lower magnitude events, using HFM, while at the same time training a cohort of doctoral students in state-of-the art technology, data analysis and modelling. The aim of the EJD is to change the way in which water quality monitoring is carried out so that the effects of episodic climatic events can be understood, thus ensuring that future water management strategies can explicitly account for their effects.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: DiSCo MRI SFN - Developing Integrated Susceptibility and Conductivity MRI for Next Generation Structural and Functional Neuroimaging Abstract: MRI is indispensable in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. These are poorly understood while their prevalence and socio-economic burden continue to rise. Structural and functional MRI can provide biomarkers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic intervention. My research vision is to develop novel MRI methods for structural and functional mapping of tissue magnetic susceptibility and electrical conductivity as these show great promise for neuroimaging in diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s (AD).\n\nSusceptibility mapping (SM), which I pioneered, is uniquely sensitive to tissue composition including iron content affected in AD while conductivity mapping (CM) probably reflects cellular disruption in AD. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) reveals how AD affects brain networks without any tasks or stimulation equipment. However, each technique currently needs a separate time-consuming MRI scan. I will develop an integrated scan for simultaneous structural SM and CM, and rsfMRI functional connectivity characterisation. This efficient scan, ideal for AD patients, will reveal totally new resting-state networks based on electromagnetic properties: resting-state functional SM and resting-state functional CM for the first time. As changes in blood susceptibility underlie fMRI, rsfSM should measure functional connectivity more directly. This also makes it sensitive to physiological noise so I will develop noise removal methods building on fMRI techniques I established. Initial fSM studies have been at 7 Tesla but I will target the more widespread 3T field to maximise applicability. As a leader in both SM and rsfMRI physiological noise removal I have the ideal background to integrate SM and CM with fMRI and extend them for ground-breaking functional electromagnetic connectivity. This research will yield a rich set of novel, multimodal MRI contrasts to allow development of new combined structural and functional biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and other diseases.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The main objectives are i) to meet an increasing commercial demand for well-trained researchers experienced in both Big Data techniques and Finance and ii) to develop and implement new quantitative and econometric methods for empirical finance and risk management with large and complex datasets. To achieve the objectives, the emphasis is put on exploiting big data techniques to manage and use datasets that are too large and complex to process with conventional methods.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions must be able to manage, process, and use massive heterogeneous data sets in a fast and robust manner for successful risk management; nonetheless, financial research and training has been slow to address the data revolution.

Immediate action is required to seize opportunities to exploit the huge potential of Big Data within the European financial world.\n\nThis world-class network consists of eight academic participants and six companies, representing banks, asset management companies, and data and solution providers. The proposed research is relevant both academically and practically, because the program is built around real challenges faced both by the academic and private sector partners. To bridge research and practice, all researchers contribute to the private sector via secondments. \n\nBigDataFinance provides the European financial community with specialists with state-of-the-art skills in finance and data-analysis to facilitate the adoption of reliable and realistic methods in the industry.

TRACE will focus on input (forming initial suspicion), processing (substantiating suspicion, collecting evidence, locating suspects and their assets) and output (producing court proof \/ admissible e-evidence) to develop ICT-enabled solutions to identify, track and document IFFs, to pave the way for recovering the proceeds of crime and to disrupt the IFFs. TRACE will apply its solutions in use cases on terrorist financing, web forensics, cyber extortion, use of cryptocurrencies in property market transactions, money laundering in arts and antiquities, and online gambling, all of which have been developed in consultation with LEAs. TRACE will make recommendations on harmonisation of information formats in suspicious activity reports.  Heretofore the differences and fragmented use of e-evidence in criminal justice processes have hindered cross-border investigations, prosecutions and convictions and recovery of assets.

Today, the most widely used technology for scanning vehicles, ranging from vans and trucks to railcars, is gamma-ray and X-ray radiography. But new technologies are required for overcoming current technological shortcomings like inability to detect the materials, usage of radioactive and harmful source, low throughput to name some.\nCosmic-ray tomography (CRT) is considered as beyond the state-of-the-art technology in cargo screening. Cosmic-ray muons are highly penetrating, their average energy is about 10,000 times the energy of a typical X-ray and they are practically non-absorbable. They are suitable to identify materials hidden inside of shielded material, too thick or deep for other imaging methods. The CRT is completely passive, exploiting naturally occurring secondary cosmic radiation. Contrary to conventional X-ray or gamma-based imaging techniques it allows to distinguish between different materials and localizes it inside the cargo or vehicle by providing visualised 3D image.\nWe will bridge the major security gap for fast and safe inspection of large number of cargos by developing the Multi-Functional Passive Detection System. The detection capability is based on using high accuracy sensors for particle tracking in combination with beyond state-of-the art tomographic reconstruction and material classification algorithms.\nThe main objective of SilentBorder is to develop and validate a new high-technology CRT scanner for border guard, customs and LEAs that enables safe and fast screening, detection and identification of hazardous and illegal goods (e.g. SNM), contraband (e.g. tobacco or explosive) as well as hidden persons in up to 20\u2019 iso containers.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

It is divided into several parts.  The first part investigates the van Diejen model (which is the most complicated model in the CMS family) and its sophisticated limiting case proposed by Takemura. The aim is to construct exact eigenfunctions of these two models using the kernel function methods. These eigenfunctions belong to an emerging new class in the theory of special functions.  The second part is devoted to the study of integrable deformations of the relativistic CMS model (Ruijsenaars model), going back to the works of Chalykh, Feigin, Veselov and Sergeev. In the trigonometric case, the deformed models are known to be integrable and the eigenfunctions of the principal Hamiltonian are given in terms of super-Macdonald polynomials. Using the kernel function identities, I will prove that all higher Hamiltonians of this model are diagonalized by the super-Macdonald polynomials. This will be used to establish orthogonality of the super-Macdonald polynomials. Extending this, I plan to establish integrability of the elliptic case. Furthermore, by using algebraic tools such as Cherednik operators and double affine Hecke algebras, and building upon a recent work of Chalykh, I will construct quantum Lax matrices for the deformed models in all cases.  Lastly, we aim to find a conceptual link between elliptic Cherednik algebras and higher Painlev\u00e9 systems. Namely, first we will obtain the classical Inozemtsev system from Cherednik algebra by a Hamiltonian reduction. By relating this to the recent results of Bertolo, Cafasso, and Rubtsov, we will then find an alternative and more natural interpretation of the higher Painlev\u00e9 equations as isomonodromic deformations.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: BactoDrug - The Bacteroides dual-pumping membrane-integral pyrophosphatase: a novel drug target Abstract: Membrane-integral pyrophosphatases (M-PPases) couple cleavage of pyrophosphatase to pumping of ions across a membrane to generate membrane potential and play an important role in resistance to stressors. The solved structures of an H+-pumping M-PPase from Vigna radiata and an Na+-pumping M-PPase from Thermotoga maritima show M-PPases form a channel through the membrane, and this channel is plugged by an ion gate formed by three charged residues. Despite these structures, there are still many outstanding questions regarding M-PPases, especially in relation to H+ and Na+ dual-pumping M-PPases.\n\nBacteroides species are a major cause of anaerobic infections, and though they are part of a healthy human gut flora, when these bacteria escape the gut, they can cause bacteremia and abscess formation. Bacteroides species are associated with high antibiotic resistance rates and have a 19% or greater mortality rate. However, they do possess a possible drug target: an H+\/Na+-pumping M-PPase.\n\nA major goal of this project is to solve the structure of the Bacteroides vulgatus H+\/Na+-pumping M-PPase to guide mutational studies to determine how M-PPases select for ions and to explore how the ion gate is opened and closed during ion pumping. Since the ion gate is closed in all M-PPase structures to date, I will also use single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to determine the kinetics and conformational changes during ion gate movement. Finally, I will use molecular mechanics modeling to simulate ion gate function and design small-molecule drug candidates. Molecules that trap the ion gate in the open conformation will convert M-PPase into a pore in the membrane of Bacteroides species, leading to collapse of the membrane potential. \n\nThis project will further my career goal of pursuing research in bacterial pathogenesis from various perspectives, utilizing X-ray crystallography and single molecule technologies.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: AlFHoNSo - Analysing Forest Hydrocarbons with Networks of Sensors Abstract: Forested ecosystems play a central role in the Earth system. However, whether for the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the uptake of ozone or the emission of reactive carbon, small-scale variability inherent in forests makes their parameterisation in models difficult. Recent developments in cheap, small, lower power sensors and robust network technology can ultimately drive a range of science communities (ecology, atmospheric chemistry, carbon flux) towards a new concept of a \u2018highly instrumented forest\u2019. Within a highly instrumented forest, the environment is autonomously observed using large numbers of low cost sensors, giving a wide spatial perspective on forest interactions with the atmosphere. Such an approach contrasts markedly with the current paradigm where a single site, equipped with a small number of highly specialised instruments, is treated as being representative of a whole forest. This fellowship will develop and apply a unique sensor network for assessment of the spatial and long-term temporal variability in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by forests. VOCs play a vital role in controlling the regional and global concentration of ozone, aerosol and methane, all of which are key players in climate change and air quality degradation, but the spatial heterogeneity of emissions from forests is unknown. The sensors will be tested both in the laboratory and in small-scale trials. The fellowship will culminate in the application of a sensor network in a UK Forestry Commission research forest, to resolve for the first time the true spatial and temporal variability of biogenic VOCs throughout a forest canopy.

{"text":"Title: SOOCCESS - SOciO-eConomiC failurE and aSpiration biaseS Abstract: From early childhood, many poor children brought up in segregated communities observe socio-economic failures such as poor living conditions, liquidity constraints, extremely high unemployment and low education levels attained by adults. Enhancing their aspirations is believed to be a tool capable of breaking one of the poverty feedback loops: poverty has been identified as a cause of the failure to aspire to one\u2019s own potential, and at the same time, low aspirations are among the potential causes of persistent poverty. Consequently, adolescents from areas of high deprivation are generally believed to have low aspirations, though, in fact, their aspirations vary considerably, and may be generally high. This signals two main aspiration biases: aspirations failure and aspirational gap. This project is aimed to investigate how stimulating success\/failure environments can reduce aspiration biases of the segregated poor, which, according to theory, should increase their chances to escape the poverty trap. The project has an interdisciplinary character: it is aimed to investigate the psychological construct of aspirations in the economic context in educational environments. Using cutting-edge methods from behavioural and experimental economics, we will experimentally investigate to what extent exposure to success\/failure environments will lead to a significant decrease\/increase in aspirational biases. From the methodological perspective, we will first design a novel approach to the experimental elicitation of aspirations, then we will design an experiment manipulating success\/failure to assess their effects on aspirations. From the empirical viewpoint, using experimental data, the project will shed new light on the relationship between socio-economic background and aspirational biases, and thus test the predictions of economic theory. To address the concern of external validity, the proposed experiments will be conducted in different cultural settings.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Multidrug efflux pumps play a major role in the development of drug resistance in bacterial pathogens. These pumps are able to actively export remarkably broad collections antibiotics and biocides out of the cell. Multidrug efflux pumps have classically been organised into five distinct families or superfamilies. Due to their importance, representative proteins from each of these families have been extensively studied.\n\nUsing a combination of functional genomics and biochemical methods to study antimicrobial resistance in the hospital pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, I recently identified AceI, the founding member of a sixth family of multidrug efflux pumps called the Proteobacterial Antimicrobial Compound Efflux (PACE) family. The PACE family is the first new family of efflux pumps to be described in 15 years. In light of its recent identification, there is a paucity of fundamental data describing how PACE family pumps mediate drug efflux. This proposal will apply in vitro biochemical, biophysical and structural analyses to reveal molecular details of the structure and functional transport mechanism operating in PACE family pumps.\n\nThis proposal will draw on the diverse collective expertise of my Fellowship Supervisor Prof Peter Henderson and his expert colleagues in membrane protein structural analyses and biophysics. In conducting this research I will build lasting collaborative links with these experts that will extend beyond the duration of this fellowship. I will receive specialised training in powerful membrane protein analysis methods that are essential to my career goal of establishing a leading research laboratory examining membrane transport proteins, from regulation to molecular mechanisms.

For example, what happened in the history of some galaxies to transform them into passive ellipticals while others, seemingly of the same mass and in the same environment, are star-forming spirals? Even such a basic question about the link between morphology and star formation has not yet been answered, revealing our theories of galaxy formation are inadequate. This is a major concern in an era where understanding the shapes of galaxies and how they relate to the underlying dark matter is essential for progress in precision cosmology.  \n\nThis project will build the missing link between the history of a galaxy and its observational properties (i.e. between cause and effect) by using numerical simulations.  Current research in this area rightly gives significant attention to the crucial problem of how feedback \u2013 energy input from supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and more \u2013 affect observable properties.  But as well as investigating this avenue, GM Galaxies will uniquely make use of my new technique (\u201cgenetic modification\u201d) to systematically investigate the role of the galaxy\u2019s merging and accretion history at high resolution.\n\nTo distinguish the fingerprints of history from the effects of feedback, we will compare to rich new data from integral field unit surveys; these reveal, for example, galactic metallicity and velocity maps. My pilot study for this project shows that such measures of a galaxy disambiguate between alternative formation routes to galaxies which would appear similar by photometric measures alone. Similarly, we will make predictions for the observable properties of the gas reservoir surrounding galaxies and for integral field observations at high redshift.

{"text":"Title: PAMMOTH - Photoacoustic\/Ultrasound Mammoscopy for evaluating screening-detected abnormalities in the breast Abstract: X-ray mammography is the mainstay of breast cancer screening programs. It is estimated that between 20 - 50% of abnormal screening mammograms will prove to be negative. The paradigm in diagnosis is to establish whether a lesion is benign or malignant. All the imaging techniques conventionally used today \u2013 diagnostic x-ray, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging have many limitations, leading to multiple and\/or repeat imaging and often unnecessary biopsy. This leads to physical, psychological and economic burdens felt at individual, familial and societal levels.  \n\nWith an aging population, high incidence of breast cancer and tightening health-care budgets, there is an urgent  requirement for a non-invasive method for in-depth assessment of the screening-detected lesion. In PAMMOTH we will showcase such an imager, combining photoacoustic  and ultrasound imaging. With the use of quantitative image reconstruction of multi-wavelength photoacoustic data, information is gained of the vascular and oxygen status of the lesion relating to tumor physiology and function. From the ultrasound part, we derive ultrasound reflection from the lesion in a manner superior to conventional breast ultrasonography, relating to anatomic features and extent of a tumor. This information will enable the radiologist to come to a diagnosis accurately and rapidly without the use of contrast agents, without pain and  discomfort to the patient, while being cost-effective and not requiring complex infrastructure. \n\nFour excellent academic groups, three dynamic SMEs, and a hospital come together with support from key stakeholders in an Advisory group, to push beyond the state-of-the-art in science and technology to achieve the PAMMOTH imager. For the SMEs, in addition to tremendous improvements in individual product lines, the new integrated diagnostic imaging instrument opens up completely new market opportunities. \n\nWe expect PAMMOTH to have a strong economic and clinical impact.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: CRYTOCOP - Coat assembly and membrane remodelling: understanding regulation of protein secretion Abstract: Eukaryotic cells are organised in membrane-bound compartments, which have defined chemical identities and carry out specific essential functions. Exchange of material between these compartments is necessary to maintain cell functionality, and is achieved in a highly specific and regulated manner by vesicular transport. To mediate protein trafficking, coat complexes assemble on membranes and couple bilayer deformation with cargo capture into transport carriers. How coat assembly can deliver the flexibility necessary to accommodate a wide variety of cargo proteins, and how the process can be regulated, are outstanding questions in the field. This is exemplified by the COPII coat, which mediates export from the ER of about a third of newly synthesized proteins. COPII assembles into two concentric layers and can form transport carriers of a variety of shapes and sizes, including tubules and spherical vesicles. This is important for export of large cargoes and is a process targeted by cargo-specific regulatory factors. The aim of this project proposal is to shed light on the molecular interactions between coat components, and understand their role in determination of coat architecture and membrane shape. We will use a combination of structural and functional approaches to characterise COPII coat assembly, and its relationship with membranes in systems of increasing complexity, ranging from in vitro reconstitutions to cells. In particular, we will use cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to understand the architecture of the coat layers in these systems. These are fast-developing techniques that uniquely target complex structures while achieving high resolutions. With my lab at the forefront of current advances, we are perfectly placed to obtain a complete view of the COPII coat assembled on membranes. Our research will answer outstanding questions in the membrane trafficking field and open new perspectives to tackle ill-characterised regulation systems.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: ARISE2 - Atmospheric dynamics Research InfraStructure in Europe Abstract: It has been robustly demonstrated that variations in the circulation of the middle atmosphere influence weather and climate throughout the troposphere all the way to the Earth\u2019s surface. A key part of the coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere occurs through the propagation and breaking of planetary-scale Rossby waves and gravity waves. Limited observation of the middle atmosphere and these waves in particular limits the ability to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of the middle atmosphere in numerical weather prediction and climate models. ARISE2 capitalizes upon the work of the EU-funded first ARISE project combining for the first time international networks with complementary technologies such as infrasound, lidar and airglow. This joint network provided advanced data products that started to be used as benchmarks for weather forecast models. The ARISE network also allows enhanced and detailed monitoring of other extreme events in the Earth system such as erupting volcanoes, magnetic storms, tornadoes and tropical thunderstorms. In order to improve the ability of the network to monitor atmospheric dynamics, ARISE2 proposes to extend i) the existing network coverage in Africa and the high latitudes, ii) the altitude range in the stratosphere and mesosphere, iii) the observation duration using routine observation modes, and to use complementary existing infrastructures and innovative instrumentations. Data will be collected over the long term to improve weather forecasting to monthly or seasonal timescales, to monitor atmospheric extreme events and climate change. Compared to the first ARISE project, ARISE2 focuses on the link between models and observations for future assimilation of data by operational weather forecasting models. Among the applications, ARISE2 proposes infrasound remote volcano monitoring to provide notifications to civil aviation. The data portal will provide high-quality data and advanced data products to a wide scientific community.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Furthermore manufacturing systems need to deal with an ever-changing environment due to short term changes caused by human or production related variability or long term changes caused by market`s demands and company\u2019s strategy, technology advancements and demographic trends.

Electrolytic ammonia synthesis, i.e. below 100 C and at atmospheric pressures, could be far more attractive: it would be powered by renewable energy and would take place at the point-of-consumption.   I have recently made a breakthrough, by demonstrating the first  unambiguous and quantitative evidence that dinitrogen electroreduction is possible under ambient conditions on a solid electrode, albeit at low efficiency  My aim for NitroScission is to elucidate pathways \u2014at a molecular level\u2014 to catalyse the reaction at high efficiency. However, only the most reactive metal or metal nitride surfaces bind to dinitrogen. Such surfaces will bind even stronger to hydrogen or oxygen from water or air. To circumvent these constraints, I will use three strategies:   \n(i) I will tailor the access of protons to the electrode-electrolyte interface, via in-situ deposited ionic interphases, exploiting recent advances in controlling the reactivity of electrolytes. \n(ii) I will tailor the binding to dinitrogen through oxygen-free fabrication and testing of metals and metal nitrides electrodes. By preventing air exposure, my team will gain access to a class of highly reactive electrodes, never previously tested in an electrochemical cell.  \n(iii) I will use electrochemical looping, to dynamically separate dinitrogen adsorption from its subsequent hydrogenation. These experiments will be enabled by a novel method that allows us to observe gas evolution in real time.  \nI will combine advanced thin film preparation methods, electrochemical tests, and in operando and ex-situ spectroscopy to establish the design principles for this important reaction. Guided by these unique tools and my scientific leadership, my team will shed unique insight into how to tailor electrode-electrolyte interfaces.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

To answer identified needs, the Easily diStributed Personal RapId Transit (ESPRIT) project aims to develop a purpose-built, light weight L6 category electric vehicle that can be stacked together to gain space. Thanks to pioneering coupling systems, up to 8 ESPRIT vehicles can be nested together in a road train, 7 being towed for an efficient redistribution of fleets and a smartly-balanced and cost efficient transport system. Within the project, 2 user scenarios are foreseen: a one-way carsharing system within city centres and a last-kilometre personal mobility system to existing public transport infrastructures in peri-urban areas. These will be tested through 3 different geographical use cases (Glasgow, Lyon and L\u2019 L\u2019Hospitalet de LLobregat near Barcelona).\nThis innovative transport system concept will be demonstrated to TRL5 though state-of-the-art developments of diverse technological bricks (including vehicle and road train architecture, coupling and guiding systems, kinetic and dynamic behaviour management systems, efficient energy supply and rapid charge battery strategies). To prove the ESPRIT concept, the project will also work on modelling and simulation tools to predict, once ESPRIT vehicles are deployed, the economic, social and environmental benefits as well as key operating strategies.\nThis concept will incite citizens to use public transport and carsharing solutions rather than their private vehicles leading to seamless intermodal transport, decongestion, significant reduction of noise and air pollution.

Although recent technological developments have facilitated quantitative analyses of provenance data, charting in increasing detail the early-20th-century movement of manuscripts, including an exodus of works to America, qualitative analyses have failed to keep pace, leaving questions of how and why particular books were valued underexplored. The PI\u2019s role in the development of the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts, which has begun to make available historic data about books, has revealed the need for a reassessment of the relationship between collecting and scholarship, and the potential for existing data about the manuscript trade to be used, with unpublished archival sources, to identify and compare the economic and philosophical values projected onto books. Thus the project uses the PI\u2019s expertise to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to assess the roles of collectors, scholars and dealers in the formation of collections of medieval manuscripts, and the impact of this on scholarship, comparing the English-speaking world, France and Germany. It will analyse published and unpublished accounts of manuscripts, together with price data, to reconstruct values projected onto books. It will seek to contextualise these values within the history of the early 20th century, assessing the impact of two world wars and other political and economic shifts on the trade in books and attitudes to manuscripts as objects of national significance. The Middle Ages are often identified with the emergence of European cultural identities, thus a reappraisal of the historiography of the study of medieval manuscripts has the potential to impact research about attitudes to European culture and identity in a wide range of disciplines.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: RIV-ESCAPE - RIVEr emissions of greenhouse gases from warming landSCAPEs Abstract: Rivers around the world release large quantities of greenhouse gas, with an estimated 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 PgC yr-1 released as carbon dioxide (CO2), and ~20-25 TgC yr-1 as methane (CH4). These fluxes are equivalent to half of the annual increase in CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere due to human activities. However, we cannot yet quantify how river CO2 and CH4 emissions will change, nor assess their potential to amplify future climate warming. There are two main challenges: i) the main drivers of CO2 and CH4 release from rivers (supply of carbon and the dynamics of river flow) change simultaneously, and their relative importance is obscured in existing data, limiting our ability to build and test predictive models; ii) the age of river CO2 and CH4 is poorly constrained, meaning that we cannot determine whether this is anthropogenic carbon that is leaking out from prior storage on land, or whether it derives from ancient carbon stores in the landscape. \n\nRIV-ESCAPE will transform our understanding by recognising the need for direct measurements that combine river CO2 and CH4 flux, river flow dynamics and C supply at high temporal resolution (minutes to hours) over seasonal timescales, across nested scales in river catchments. Such novel field installations could be used anywhere to improve our understanding: we will focus on Arctic rivers that are experiencing pronounced warming and hold large stores of ancient carbon in soils. In parallel, we will use cutting-edge isotope geochemistry methods for river gases, waters and sediments to quantify the controls on the age and source of CO2 and CH4 in rivers around the world. The new empirical data will combine with physical and numerical experiments to provide a step-change in our knowledge of how changes in temperature and precipitation set river greenhouse gas source and the rate of release, allowing us to assess for the first time the sensitivity of river CO2 and CH4 emissions to future warming.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: MagProtoCell - Magnetic micromachines based on protocell design and engineering Abstract: Protocells are artificial cellular systems exhibiting lifelike properties, which are proposed as a stepping-stone for understanding the origin of life on Earth. Features such as encapsulation, replication, metabolism and selective exchange of chemicals with the environment will enable their use as micromachines in a number of emerging applications (e.g., environment clean-up, clinical diagnosis, drug delivery, remote sensing, bioreactor technology). However, progress in such applications will be enhanced by the synthetic construction of protocells capable of directed movement in fluidic environments in response to external stimuli. To date, motility has been achieved only in a few cases, which involve a response to changes in chemical concentrations (chemotaxis) in the surrounding medium. However, controlling the chemical composition of the local environment is challenging, and thus alternative ways to stimulate motility are needed. In this regard, external magnetic fields (MFs) will enable high levels of control of protocell motility and spatial disposition to be achieved by employing noncontact forces. This is the aim of this proposal: to design and construct synthetic protocells able to sense and respond to external MFs. A key outcome of the work will be the development of a new class of magnetic micromachines based on protocell design and engineering. Such machines will couple MF-directed motility with the temporal and spatial delivery of advanced biomimetic functions. The key factor of the proposed methodology is the inclusion of colloidal magnetic particles at strategic locations in the protocell composition or in the external medium. Thereby, the expertise of the applicant (Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Arco) in the field of MF-responsive materials will be applied to the multidisciplinary and cutting-edge field of protocells in which the hosting group at the University of Bristol (under the leadership of Prof. Mann FRS) has made great progress in the last few years.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Paradoxically, studies of social dynamics often focus on hierarchies, state formation and political structures ruled by coercive power, with comparatively little regard to the mechanisms whereby humans voluntarily collaborate. Encouragingly, new research on collective action is reconciling classic anthropology with game theory and empirical studies of group resource management, thus heralding a fundamental transformation.\nArchaeological collective action studies have mostly concentrated on subsistence and relatively simple technologies. There is a perplexing lack of research on cooperative production of luxury items, i.e. those materialising exceptional investment in materials, skill and\/or labour, and not geared towards subsistence. Evidence for goldwork, polychrome textile-making and lapidary work in stateless societies provides compelling proof that complex technologies could be sustained in the absence of coercive powers, but explanations are lacking.\nHow can complex technological systems be sustained in the absence of coercive political administrations? To address this question, REVERSEACTION will deploy archaeological science methods to the reverse engineering of archaeological artefacts made of multiple materials, combined with environmental studies, and fostering exploratory collaborations with anthropology, sociology, management studies and crafts.\nA key focus will be placed on two stateless societies of Pre-Columbian America: Muisca and Nari\u00f1o.

{"text":"Title: SPECTRUM - Spectral theory of random operators Abstract: The theme of this proposal is the study of random operators associated with some geometric structure, and the influence of the geometry on the spectral properties of the operator. Such operators appear in problems from theoretical physics, and lead to new and interesting mathematical structures.\nOne circle of questions is related to random operators, which describe the motion of a quantum particle in a disordered medium, such as random band matrices. The behaviour of the particle is influenced by the underlying geometry, as quantified by the (non-rigorous) Thouless criterion for localisation in terms of the mixing time of the classical random walk; in the context of random band matrices, the predictions of the Thouless criterion are supported by additional (non-rigorous) arguments. These predictions have so far not been rigorously justified; an exception is my own result, validating it at the spectral edges. One of our goals is to develop new methods, which would be applicable in the bulk of the spectrum, for random band matrices and other operators with geometric structure.\nAnother circle of questions is given by random processes taking values in large random matrices. The spectral properties of the random matrix at every point of the underlying space are described by the random matrix theory; but how does the spectrum evolve along the underlying space? The richness of this question is apparent from the one-dimensional case of Dyson Brownian motion. We intend to study the local eigenvalue statistics of general matrix-valued random processes with multi-dimensional underlying space; to give a complete description of the random processes which appear in the limit, first for the spectral edges and then for the bulk of the spectrum, and to explore the appearance of these processes in a variety of basic questions of mathematical physics.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

It is therefore of utmost importance to develop economic routes for the production of H2 to make it more attractive as energy carrier medium in the future. Particularly, Co and Ni based compounds have gained attention for molecular H2 catalysis lately. Co glyoxime and pentapyridine coordinative complexes as well as Ni phosphine compounds are promising candidates exhibiting high catalytic activity in both electro- and light driven H2 catalysis in water. Nevertheless, for technological application the catalysts have to be immobilized on electrode surfaces. The adsorption strongly alters the catalytic reactions, which is still not clearly understood. To investigate the adsorbed catalysts, advanced spectroscopic methods are required that are able to provide sensitive information on the catalytic reaction at a molecular level. The aim of this proposed research is to investigate the heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism of Co and Ni mediated catalysis using an innovative combination of potential controlled confocal resonance Raman and ATR FT infrared absorption spectroscopy assisted by electrocatalytic methods and DFT calculations. For this, the three mentioned types of catalysts will be adsorbed on metal oxide surfaces and their catalytic reactions spectroelectrochemically and electrochemically investigated. Special emphasis is led on the role of heterogeneous electron and proton transfer steps on the overall heterogeneous catalytic activity compared to the homogeneous case.

The ESRs obtain knowledge and skills needed to turn environmental problems into economic opportunities. SuPER-W focuses not only on technology development through research, but the ESRs are also trained in translating research into policy, creative problem-solving, identification of bottlenecks for effective implementation of resource recovery technologies, development of business cases and urban\/industrial ecosystems, and assessment of sustainability and the role of public perception and policy in innovation. Furthermore, they acquire a set of commercial, entrepreneurial and managerial skills that prepare them as future leaders. All ESRs are supervised by at least 2 promoters from 2 universities and co-supervised by a researcher from a non-academic partner organisation.

{"text":"Title: FORCE-UI - Force-responsive Deformable User Interfaces Abstract: Touch input is the universal approach for communicating intention to interactive computing systems. However, touchscreens are flat, solid surfaces that fail to reproduce the qualities of real-world object interaction (e.g. deformation, stiffness, springiness). Further, their expressivity is fundamentally bounded by a single measurable dimension: contact with a solid, touch-sensitive surface. This project will radically increase the expressivity of touchscreen-based interaction by co-locating three force modalities into a single visual display surface (force input, resistive- and kinetic- force feedback). This will create a new paradigm for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Force Responsive Deformable User Interfaces (FRUI). FRUIs will allow users to \u2018push through\u2019 a display and for the display to \u2018push back\u2019.\n\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, I will combine innovative hardware prototyping with experimental computer science and psychophysical study methodologies to complete four key research objectives: (1) Develop novel engineering approaches to construct FRUI; (2) Empirically characterise humans\u2019 capabilities and responses during interaction with FRUI; (3) Construct conceptual models, metaphors, and principles for user interaction with FRUI; (4) Evaluate the expressivity, efficiency, and user satisfaction of FRUIs.\n\nI am considered an international leader in the development of shape-changing interfaces (interfaces whose physical geometry adapts to underlying digital content), as evidenced through my strong research track record (including two recent agenda-setting papers at the premier HCI conference), international community leadership, and external grant success. This background ideally places me to conduct all aspects of this highly ambitious programme of work. FORCE-UI has the potential to revolutionise touch input, and in doing so will have a significant impact on society\u2019s use of interactive systems.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: INNOTARGETS - Innvative approaches to identification  of metabolic Targets for antimicrobials Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a challenge to human health and health-systems, and we need novel antimicrobials or drugs that can re-sensitize multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria to existing antimicrobials. Metabolic enzymes have largely been ignored in the search for antimicrobial targets, and they are an untapped resource. The aim of INNOTARGETS is to train ESRs in highly innovative approaches to identify metabolic drug targets in pathogenic bacteria. The training will deliver ESRs that can become creative, future research team leaders within industry or academia. The network joins 7 academic and 3 non-academic organisations, including two antibiotic discovery companies. The training is multi-disciplinary and trans-sectoral and provides 432 person-months of training to 12 ESRs. The types of targets foreseen are: 1) Metabolic enzymes that are essential for infection, Such enzymes will be identified by use of transposon libraries 2) Redundant enzymes, which can be blocked in parallel. Relevant pairs of enzymes will be identified by use of metabolic models, and a search for bioactive molecules, with affinity for more than one target will be carried out using a novel screening platform. 3) Metabolic enzymes which are essential for expression of resistance mechanisms or spread of resistance plasmids in MDR bacteria. Putative targets for all three types of reactions will be validated using cell culture and animal models.  \n\nINNOTARGETS will establish a joint training syllabus designed to widen the career prospects of the ESRs and to optimize their professional competences. It includes training through research, including secondments, network wide training courses and summer schools, self-directed learning, workshops and training through interaction with external partners and visiting scientists.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: SIMBA - Sodium-Ion and sodium Metal BAtteries for efficient and sustainable next-generation energy storage Abstract: The project main goal is the development of a highly cost-effective, safe, all-solid-state-battery with sodium as mobile ionic charge carrier for stationary energy storage applications. To achieve this goal, several aspects need to be considered including material innovations, sustainable electrode and cell manufacturing, improved characterisation and understanding of the electrochemical processes. SIMBA has the ambitious and realistic goal to tackle these challenges and has formulated the following objectives: (1) Safer batteries with a novel Solid-State Electrolyte (SSE) (TRL3-5), by developing a new class of single-ion conducting polymers (SIPEs) and its production method. (2) Higher energy density and more durable anodes by developing materials up to TRL5 using sustainable manufacturing methods. (3) Low-cost and higher energy cathode materials, by developing ultra-low-cost Prussian White (PW) and high energy density layered oxides (P2\/O3) up to TRL5. (4) Obtaining deep understanding of fundamental mechanisms incl. degradation phenomena, taking place at the Solid-Electrolyte-Interface (SEI) and within the battery components. (5) Demonstration of a scaled-up highly efficient 12V, 1Ah battery module incl. BMS to validate the re-use of materials, recyclability, performance, LCA, and potential for further development. Jointly this will result in a sodium-based battery demonstrating the improved performance, recyclability and sustainability, for a stationary energy storage use-case, including a detailed Total Cost of Ownership analysis.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: FIBRING - Fibring of manifolds and groups Abstract: The study of manifolds that fibre over the circle has a long and exciting history at the core of modern manifold topology, starting with Farrell's work on the problem in high ('surgery') dimensions, and running through the celebrated work of Stallings and Thurston in dimension 3, to Agol's 2013 solution of Thurston's virtual fibring conjecture. Parallel developments in group theory have placed the study of Bieri-Neumann-Strebel (BNS) invariants, which emerged in the 1980s, at the heart of the subject; these invariants describe when a group fibres, i.e. admits a map onto Z with finitely generated kernel. In the research outlined here a powerful new set of algebraic invariants - agrarian polytopes - will be used to establish a new frontier in the theory of fibring. The main goal is to achieve a complete description of all possible fibrings over the circle for aspherical manifolds in surgery dimensions.\n\nAn agrarian polytope is a subset of the vector space H_1(X;R), where X is a group or a manifold. It is defined in the novel framework of agrarian invariants that I am developing, a theory that has already borne remarkable fruit. The theory provides algebraic counterparts to the (analytic) L2-invariants that have proved so powerful in geometric topology, group theory and global analysis over the last four decades.\n\nThe primary focus of the research proposed here lies in establishing new deep connections between the algebra of group rings and their completions, and global properties of aspherical manifolds and groups. Three further goals of the proposal are: to develop the theory of agrarian invariants in positive characteristic; to show that agrarian invariants are profinitely rigid; to apply the new technology to the study of dynamical zeta functions. Each of these goals promises a breakthrough in its respective domain.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: NOVACHIP - Novel vascular-like BBB-on-a-chip Abstract: There is great need to develop safer and more biologically relevant models for drug screening. Recent reports indicate that up to 20% of acute kidney complications can be linked to drug-induced nephrotoxicity and more than 40 molecules found to reduce Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD)-related plaques in animal models were shown to be ineffective in AD patients. It is increasingly evident that both in vitro and in vivo models being used to develop drugs have a limited capacity to predict the pathophysiology of human disease, personalized response, and off-target drug toxicity. The inability to properly test drugs and treatments to diseases such as AD constitutes a risk for pharmaceutical companies and a major obstacle to overcome. This ERC PoC proposal aims to establish a practical microfluidic fabrication process capable of recreating structural and biomechanical features of native blood vessels. Specifically, we aim to develop a scalable 3D Blood-Brain-Barrier in vitro model (BBB-on-a-chip) able to provide a higher level of biological relevance than current in vitro models. The development of such a system would represent a major break-through for the pharmaceutical industry generating therapies for a variety of neurological disorders. Thanks to the ERC Starting Grant STROFUNSCAFF, we have developed a simple fabrication process that combines bioprinting and self-assembly to grow functional fluidic devices with endothelialized vessel-like capillaries (patent application in preparation). NOVACHIP proposes to a) build scalable microfluidic devices made from capillaries that incorporate relevant cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, exhibit tissue-like stiffness, and can be designed with specific sizes and geometries to better resemble the native BBB and b) compare it to a commercially available in vitro model as well as c) an established rat model by quantifying permeability of specific imaging biomarkers for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: TAPAS - TArgeting Platelet Adhesion receptors in thrombosiS Abstract: TAPAS will position Europe at the forefront of innovative research to prevent thrombosis and thromboinflammation, and will train a uniquely-qualified cohort of ESRs in a highly intersectorial and multi-disciplinary programme that will equip them with the knowledge and transferable skills required in the broad biomedical sector. The research will focus on platelets which are small cells in the blood that play a critical role in prevention of excessive bleeding following injury (haemostasis). Activation of platelets in diseased vessels gives rise to thrombotic disorders such as heart attack and stroke, two of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Patients at risk of thrombosis are treated with medicines that inhibit platelets for life, but many patients still undergo thrombotic episodes or encounter serious bleeds through diminished haemostasis. There is thus an urgent need for novel and safe anti-platelet medicines that powerfully target thrombosis but preserve haemostasis.  In TAPAS, an original and innovative approach will be undertaken to find new ways to target thrombosis through co-operation of academic experts in distinct disciplines with key skills from the private sector. TAPAS will generate and integrate knowledge from analytical complex \u2018omics\u2019, advanced microscopy, cell biology, microfluidics, in vivo models, contemporary systems biology and high throughput screens to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention and novel lead compounds or biologics. The research skills developed in this programme are applicable to other complex diseases and represent essential training in modern day research for the next cohort of academic and private sector scientists that are able to convert complex biological understanding into new medicines. The shared knowledge and close interaction between beneficiaries and partners makes this programme ideally suited to an EJD and will deliver 15 ESRs in 21st century biomedical research.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: SENF - Selective Electrochemical Nucleophilic Fluorination Abstract: The incorporation of fluorine into organic compounds is extremely important for designing molecules with specific function. Fluorine is primed for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs and agrochemicals, and is crucial for the life-changing imaging technique, Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Thus, selective fluorination is an area of significant interest in organic synthesis.\n\nThis research programme will develop a concept that promises to revolutionise fluorination chemistry. While nucleophilic fluoride (F-) sources are inexpensive and readily available, they have unfavourable reactivity compared to electrophilic fluorine sources (F+), which are typically expensive, wasteful and not suited to either large scale synthesis or PET. By transmuting F- into F+, we can get the best of both worlds! We will develop a concept based on umpolung (polarity reversal) to invent a number of novel synthetic methodologies or to expand useful reactions into new chemical space. The overall vision is to create new pathways to new bioactive molecules that are either more potent, have improved pharmacokinetics, or can be new radiochemical tracers.\n\nOur strategy relies on the combination of catalysis and electrochemical oxidation to perform this thermodynamically demanding task. The use of electrochemistry is essential for this strategy, because it is necessary to be able to \u2018dial-in\u2019 any oxidising potential with high control. New organo- and organometallic catalysts, heterogeneous electrocatalysts and fluoride sources will be developed as part of the studies, which will be of value to the fields of fluorination, homogeneous catalysis, synthesis and energy research. Medicinal, process and radio chemists will all benefit as their toolbox of methods will expand, thereby facilitating the discovery and manufacture of drugs and chemicals that improve the quality of human life around the globe.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: MAGicSky - Magnetic Skyrmions for Future Nanospintronic Devices Abstract: Challenges facing technology for power efficient, high density, high speed information processing and storage are well recognised, and strategies for meeting them in the short term define the shape of industry roadmaps. As a consequence, in the next ten years, radically new approaches will be implemented and will transform how data is stored and manipulated. Skyrmion-based devices are newcomers to this global race for the next generations of information technology. Skyrmions were discovered in magnetic crystals only a few years ago, but we already have within reach a possibility to create them in nanoscale devices that can be made compatible with conventional integrated circuit technology. Our work in MAGicSky will substantiate this possibility.\nThe potential benefits are enormous. Skyrmions are magnetic solitons that carry information, and are remarkably robust against defects that can trap or destroy them due to the topology of their magnetic texture. Topology also appears to further underlie other of their technologically important features: mobility with small continuous currents and singular dynamics under radio-frequency. MAGicSky will engage some of the most advanced materials fabrication, characterisation and microscopic imaging facilities in Europe together with leading theoretical and computational modelling capabilities, to create the first proof-of-concept room temperature spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions.","gt":false,"conf":0.6}

Recent advances have shown that NWs with predefined properties can be grown, offering a new paradigm enabling functional device prototypes including: biosensors, solar cells, transistors, quantum light sources and lasers. The critical mass of scientific knowledge gained now needs to be translated into NW technologies for industry. FP7-MC NanoEmbrace (ITN) and FUNPROB (IRSES), made substantial contributions to NW research, producing excellent scientific and technological results (>100 journal papers published) and delivered outstanding training in nanoscience and transferable skills to ESRs.\n\nDespite demonstrable scientific and technological advantages of NWs, NW-based technology concepts have not yet been translated into market-ready products, because industry and academia have not worked hand-in-hand to commercialize the research findings. Thus, it is essential that NW research is now directed towards customer-oriented scientific R&D; whilst applying innovative industrial design techniques to ensure rapid translation of the basic technologies into commercial devices.\n\nThis ambitious challenge requires close collaboration between academia and the nascent NW industry, combining the efforts of scientists and engineers to address market needs. Building upon our previous achievements, a team of leading scientific experts from top institutions in Europe, strengthened by experts in innovative design and industrial partners with an excellent track record of converting cutting edge scientific ideas into market products has formed the INDEED network to address this challenge.

This brittleness is intrinsically present in material composition that cannot plastically deform and make them sensitive to any defect introduced during their fabrication or usage. \nThe goal of this project is to produce small Scale interlocking mechanism for Strong and Tough mEtamatEriaL (SSTEEL) that will provide a material independent solution to brittleness. Interlocking mechanisms provide in theory one of the most efficient way to increase toughness by creating crack blocking compressive stresses in response to tensile stresses. Because a brittle material strength is inversely linked to its size, my team and I first objective will be to develop a new process to form interlocking mechanism based on micron-sized elements using a combination of light-based additive manufacturing, shrinking ink design to access sub-printer resolution, and fragmentation. The second objective will be to implement this mechanism at an even smaller scale using rational material selection, solid state chemistry, and colloidal processing to fabricate an interfacial binder for the elements. The fracture process of SSTEEL sample will span several length scales and a specific task will be to use a combination of image correlation and modelling to fully characterise the existing damaging mechanism and inform the improvement of future designs.\nThese new structures and concepts developed by my group will promote the development of tough structure for today\u2019s and future structural and functional engineering applications by changing any brittle material to become strong, stiff, deformable, and reliable materials.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: CHROMAVISION - Super-resolution visualisation and manipulation of metaphase chromosomes Abstract: CHROMAVISION aims to develop a pioneering chromosome imaging and manipulation platform that will fuel the next decades of structural chromosome research. Chromosomal abnormalities are characteristic of many disorders such as cancer, impaired fertility due to maternal aging, and neurological disorders such as fragile X syndrome. If humanity is to fully understand the wide range of diseases that are associated to errors in cell division, we must be able to further 'zoom in' on healthy and diseased chromosomes in all their complexity. The CHROMAVISION platform will allow molecular biologists to automatically isolate individual chromosomes from small tissue or cell samples and have these delivered to a super-resolution microscope. Chromosome isolation and delivery is achieved by an opto-fluidic chip that is able to trap, visualise and lyse individual cells and separate metaphase chromosomes from cell lysate. Single chromosomes can be \u201chand-selected\u201d and brought into focus of the Super-Resolution Correlative Tweezers Fluorescence Microscope (CTFM-SR3D) that is developed in CHROMAVISION. This instrument will for the first time enable 3D, super-resolution, real-time metaphase chromosome observation and manipulation studies under near-physiological conditions. The technique will push the boundaries of what is currently possible in microfluidics and super-resolution microscopy and combine these into a single powerful approach for chromosome studies. Furthermore, the platform will be applied in CHROMAVISION to address key challenges in clinical and fundamental chromosome research, potentially resulting in breakthrough discoveries. Better imaging and understanding of the chromosomal mechanisms will contribute to our knowledge of the etiology of human diseases and aid drug discovery.

{"text":"Title: PhilAnd - The origin and early development of philosophy in tenth-century al-Andalus: the impact of ill-defined materials and channels of transmission. Abstract: The objective of PhilAnd is to conduct a large-scale exploration of how, and under which form, philosophy appeared for the first time in al-Andalus. This issue is pivotal to understanding the history of sciences and ideas, and the role of the Arab-Muslim world in this transfer to Medieval Europe. Its relevance today also lies in the fact that it addresses questions of cultural and religious identities, since the formative stage of philosophy in al-Andalus proved decisive in shaping the intellectual background of many later authors from the Peninsula, whether Muslims, Jews, or Christians. At the crossroads of major lines of enquiries in scholarship and in line with recent discoveries having important chronological implications, PhilAnd focuses on the 10th century, a period usually disregarded by historians on the assumption that philosophy as such was not cultivated in the Iberian Peninsula before the 11th-12th centuries. Its originality is also to put emphasis on \u2018ill-defined\u2019 materials and channels of transmission, a field which remains largely unexplored. This project consists of five topics designed for highly-specialised scholars, and of another three transversal types of exploration conducted in the form of conferences convened with leading experts in the world. The final objectives are to test the hypothesis: 1) that the emergence of philosophy in al-Andalus significantly predates the currently accepted time; and 2) that the impact of this formative stage was considerably wider than commonly acknowledged. This project also seeks to provide a better evaluation of the originality of the first Andalus\u012b philosophers with respect to their Oriental forerunners. This cutting-edge investigation is likely to stimulate major changes in our perception of how this primeval stage of philosophy in al-Andalus determined the subsequent developments of rational speculation among the three monotheistic communities of the Peninsula and the intellectual formation of Europe.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The interrelated fields of mechanobiology and biomimetic engineered disease models have come to the fore in the last decade1\u20133 and provide a range of opportunities to investigate therapeutic modalities4. These fields have implications for cancer research in three major aspects: 1) dissection of the cell biology governing microenvironmental sensing; 2) development of biomimetic platforms that enhance both the relevance (accuracy) of experimental models and our understanding of tumour biology, especially at the level of microenvironment and cell signalling; and 3) creation of analysis tools to quantify cell sensing.

{"text":"Title: ANCESTORS - Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe Abstract: How did politics and inequality work in prehistoric Europe? Traditionally, politics has been seen in terms of discrete political ranks identified through differential treatment of individual burials. But this results in classifying much of prehistory, where the dead were treated in ways which effaced individual identity, as egalitarian. The result is an artificially dichotomous history: Neolithic people had landscapes, rituals and ancestors, Bronze and Iron Age people had politics and inequality. In the last two decades this approach has been strongly critiqued. Burial treatment rarely relates to status so directly; the dead serve many different political roles. Inequality in pre-state groups rarely consists of clear strata; inequality and equality exist in tension within groups. Inequality may have been present throughout European prehistory, but manifest situationally through differential life chances, kinship, ritual or ancestorhood, rather than overtly through political command, wealth or identity. But this new perspective has never been tested empirically.\n\tThis project tests alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways. To investigate social relations in life, it uses osteobiography, reconstructing life stories from skeletons through scientific data on identity, health, diet, mobility and kinship. To understand deathways, it employs a second new methodology, funerary taphonomy. Combining osteobiography and taphonomy allows us to connect ancient lives and deaths. Peninsular Italy provides a substantial test sequence typical of much of Europe. For each of three key periods (Neolithic, 6000-4000 BC; Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, 4000-1800 BC; Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age, 1800-600 BC), 200+ individuals will be analysed. The results will allow us to evaluate for the first time how inequality affected lives in prehistoric Europe and what role ancestors played in it.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: LENSD - Liquid Exfoliation of Nanomaterials using Spinning Discs Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have received significant attention over the past decade due to their remarkable material properties. Graphene is the most frequently studied, however a range of other 2D materials such as molybdenum disulfide and boron nitride have also demonstrated properties which will help society advance in areas from opto-electronics to sustainable energy. One of the biggest challenges currently facing 2D nanomaterials is scalable production. Current exfoliation processes are insufficient for industrial scale production due to high energy requirements, poor yield (typically < 5 wt%), introduction of material defects and low production rates (< 6 g\/h). This project aims to address these process limitations. A novel liquid exfoliation approach will be investigated, using continuous flow over a spinning disc to create mono- and few-layer materials. The research activities will provide a new holistic insight into shear-induced liquid exfoliation, by experimentally and numerically examining how the fluid mechanics and multiphase transport phenomena over the spinning disc affect material characteristics at the nanoscale. The investigation involves cooperation between multiple disciplines. Experiments include the optical techniques of infrared thermography, high-speed imagery and particle image velocimetry. The researcher will receive extensive training in advanced numerical methods for simulating thin liquid films and interfacial flows at Imperial College London. Training in microscopy techniques will also be completed for the measurement of nanosheet defects and size. These research activities will assist the development of future liquid exfoliation technologies and are aligned with personalised actions to advance career development.

Seagate Sail and cruise control aims to provide an adoptable and beneficial solution for commercial ship owners to reduce their fuel bills and cut emissions by 20%. The system is able to offer a solution to both problems whilst at the same time being suited to the needs of commercial ships, which makes the solution unique and highly desirable.  The Seagate Sail, installed on the vessel\u2019s deck, will convert wind into driving force.  The Seagate Cruise Control will convert the driving force into fuel saving, by proportionally reducing the engine power. With the Seagate solution, the vessel will cruise at the original speed (and therefore keep to the Estimated Time of Arrival) using 20% less fuel.\nThe solution is at a mature stage of development and therefore the feasibility assessment will focus on the development of the industrial chain to set-up and validate the scale-up production of Seagate Sail, a sound IP management strategy, solid financial projections and the sale agreements for the commercialisation. The sails will be developed in Europe involving different industrial partners, managed by a British and Italian team. Once commercialised, Seagate will maintain its headquarters and manufacturing activities in Europe offering new job opportunities across the continent. Seagate aims to set a commercial partnership with a top European engine supplier to speed up the commercial growth of its products in Europe and Worldwide.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: DynFish - How the dynamics of personality variation, food intake and social interactions determine anti-predator escape Abstract: Escape responses (reaction to a threatening stimulus) are widespread in the animal kingdom and are critical for survival in many species. In recent years, it has become apparent that individuals differ consistently from one another in their behaviour, often called \u2018animal personality variation\u2019. Boldness refers to the extent to which animals take risks, and is a major personality trait that has important ecological and evolutionary implications. While it is widely accepted that the trade-off between exposure to predation risk and the benefit gained from it (e.g., greater access to food) generates personality variation in boldness, how and why bolder individuals are more likely to be preyed upon remain to be investigated. Furthermore, personality variation is also common in social species. Despite the extensive research on collective vigilance, personality variation has rarely been considered in this context. \n\nIn this project, I will study how the relationship between boldness and food intake shapes anti-predator escape responses, shedding light on how the mechanisms of the food-mortality trade-off generate personality variation in boldness. For this purpose, I will first conduct experimental work on individuals and groups of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Individuals and groups will be tested in a setup allowing me to precisely control the behaviour of a predator model and study how escape responses vary with individual boldness, food intake and social interactions. Second, I will couple this experimental work with computer simulations to 1) fully characterise the food-mortality trade-off, 2) elucidate the mechanisms underlying individual differences in boldness, and 3) give new insights into the evolution and maintenance of personality variation under predation risk in different ecological conditions.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: TankRob - In-service intrusive Non-Destructive Testing of above ground and underground petrochemical storage tank floors and walls to detect corrosion Abstract: It is estimated that 20% of storage tank accidents are caused by cracks or raptures on the tank structure. The majority of the bulk liquids stored in these tanks include crude oil and derived products which are extremely hazardous to the environment; a spill of only one gallon of oil can contaminate a million gallons of water.\nStorage tank NDT inspection is very costly and degrading to the environment. Tank operators need to clear and vent the tank in order for human inspectors to enter it; a process that takes approximately 4 weeks and costs more than \u20ac500k while it causes hazardous gases to be released into the atmosphere.\nThere is currently no inspection solution allowing for low-cost and 100% surface tank inspection. It is this gap that gives rise to unique business opportunity which InnotecUK (Dynamic robotic NDT solution provider), Technic-Control and Integrity NDT (Leading NDT instrument and service providers) aspire to seize with the aid of TWI (World-class NDT technique research organization) and LSBIC (Leading robotic control research institute).\nOur vision is clear; we aim to redefine storage tank NDT inspection by commercializing TankRob, a leading-edge NDT inspection robot capable of in-service operation and 100% surface coverage thanks to a specially designed surface changing mechanism.\nTankRob\u2019s operation has already been demonstrated in water tanks and its performance indicates tremendous potential. We now need to finalize the system\u2019s commercial version, obtain the necessary certifications and validate its performance in oil storage tanks. Our primary target customers will be large storage tank operators and SME NDT service providers initially in  European, Asian and Middle-eastern markets.\nTo this end we have come together as a consortium pursuing \u20ac3m funding. Our goal is to grow our businesses by \u20ac202.86m in gross sales resulting \u20ac39.47m of profit over the 10 years after our product\u2019s market launch, translating to a total amount of 897 new jobs.","gt":false,"conf":0.1}
{"text":"Title: CaMILLET - Application of crop genetics to improve Calcium content in millets and other crops for promoting health benefits in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis Abstract: With osteoporosis becoming an increasing threat to human health, this project is directed towards finding an inexpensive solution to this problem using crop genetics. Biofortification of human diet with food that are naturally rich in Calcium (Ca) is proposed. Among all cultivated cereals, finger millet (Eleusine coracana), an annual small millet of Africa and Asia, has been found to have the highest concentration of Ca (350mg\/100g) in its grains. This proposal aims to investigate the genetic variations of Ca accumulation in finger millet germplasm using chemical phenotyping and genomics, and to use this knowledge in further improving the concentration of this micronutrient in finger millet and other staple crops. Specific objectives of the study are: (1) to explore the extent of genetic diversity for Ca content present in world collection of finger millet germplasms; (2) to identify genomic regions associated with Ca accumulation in finger millet grains using next generation sequencing, chemical phenotyping and GWAS analysis; (3) to identify and validate candidate genes underlying genomic regions found to be associated with Ca accumulation in finger millet; and (4) use comparative genomics to identify similar genes and processes in staple cereals like wheat, rice, barley or oats grown in Europe. The project will identify genes involved in Ca accumulation in crops and the prospects of their breeding into new varieties through plant breeding. Such crop varieties will benefit the smallholder farmers who will grow them (by adding value to their food products) and also provide valuable, superior raw material to industries for developing functional food rich in Calcium. Availabilities of such food and food products will increase Ca consumption and reduce the health and economic impacts of osteoporosis.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: MIDAS - Predictive modelling of GPCR druggable allosteric sites Abstract: G protein coupled-receptors (GPCRs) are the most successful class of druggable targets in the human genome with an estimated 30 to 60 % of prescription drugs in European Union. GPCRs biological state can be modulated by small molecule ligands acting on spatially distinct allosteric binding sites (ABSs) that result more selective and less toxic than drugs binding to orthosteric sites. The discovery of lead compounds targeting ABSs is challenging and to date has largely been achieved through cost-intensive and time-consuming high-throughput screening. The recent release of X-ray structures of GPCRs in the complex with allosteric modulators opens new opportunities to develop structure-based computer aided methodologies to identify ABSs.\nMIDAS will aim to develop a computational methodology for the search of GPCR ABSs that will include cutting-edge enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation methods in cosolvent mapping. The action will solve several current limitations in cosolvent mapping: probe non-specific binding, protein denaturation, low probe sampling, and membrane distortion. MIDAS firstly develop the methodology in retrospective studies, aiming to identify ABSs in the M2, CRF1, P2Y and GCGR receptors for whom crystal structures complexed with allosteric modulators are available. The computational procedures will be developed for identification of extracellular and intracellular ABSs and ABSs at the interface between GPCR helices and lipids. Next, MIDAS will explore the developed protocols in prospective studies using the M3, \u00b5-opipid and CCR5 receptors with available X-ray structures and known ligands. The action envisions the collaboration with experts from both academia and industry and is set to expand scientific, transferable and collaborative skills of the Experience Researcher. The outcome of the action will foster the development of novel health technologies for the discovery of safer drugs targeting membrane proteins.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: EFT4NP - Probing New Physics at the Large Hadron Collider: the Effective Field Theory Pathway Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is hunting for signs of New Physics (NP) in the vast amount of data collected by its experiments. If new states are heavier than the collider energy reach, their presence can be revealed by modifications of the interactions of the known particles. The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) parametrises such deviations from the SM, extending the sensitivity to scales beyond those directly probed at colliders. Determining the parameters of the EFT will shed light on the nature of NP and will provide hints to the most important questions in particle physics, such as the shape of the Higgs potential, its relation to electroweak baryogenesis and the amount of CP-violation and its connection to the matter-anti-matter asymmetry. A dedicated campaign of measurements and their SMEFT interpretation is a major goal of the LHC and requires coordination between experimentalists and theorists.   \n\nI aim at making essential beyond the state-of-the-art theoretical contributions to the LHC SMEFT programme by:  \n1) Providing the first fully generic next-to-leading order QCD and electroweak Monte Carlo implementation of SMEFT operators, to allow theorists and experimentalists to perform realistic simulations.    \n2) Combining accurate SMEFT predictions with LHC data to constrain the operators through a novel robust global determination. The findings, particularly if different from the SM expectations, will point to the scale and nature of NP.   \n3) Exploring new challenging proposals, such as i) the impact of operator running and mixing and ii) the optimisation of ways of extracting the Higgs self-coupling and probing CP-violation at the LHC, two topics with profound implications for our theoretical understanding of particle physics.    \n\nThe proposal plays to a key strength of my research expertise and my research record uniquely positions me to successfully lead this ambitious project, which is vital to exploit the full LHC potential.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: EVNSMAS - An evolutionary approach to automated norm synthesis for multi agent systems Abstract: The field of multi-agent systems (MAS) is concerned with the theory, design, and implementation of systems of semi-autonomous software agents that operate in an environment, and typically have conflicting goals. A key issue in such domains is that of coordination: how to design agents to minimise any potential negative aspects of their interactions, and to maximise any potential positive aspects. A key approach to coordination is that of normative systems. A normative system defines constraints on the behaviour of agents to coordinate their interactions. This research programme is at the intersection of normative systems design and evolutionary game theory (EGT). EGT studies how evolutionary forces can lead populations to game theoretic solutions, and has been useful in understanding, for example the distributions of populations of species in habitats. The hypotheses of this project are that (1) EGT can provide a useful mathematical framework to model and understand normative systems in MAS; and (2) EGT techniques can provide a powerful framework to engineer normative systems for MAS. Thus, norm synthesis will consist of an evolutionary process in which most successful norms will prosper, while unsuccessful norms will be naturally discarded. The tools used to understand such norms will be solution concepts from EGT - notably the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy. In this project we will develop both frameworks for understanding EGT for normative systems design and to synthesise normative systems for MAS, and we will empirically investigate our techniques in the context of two application domains. To carry out this project the fellow will be trained in classical game theory and EGT. To this aim he will benefit from supervision of Prof Michael Wooldridge, and collaboration with his research group in Oxford. This project will develop science and will contribute to the development of the fellow's career plan to become an independent researcher.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: NanoBioCar - Impacts of Nanoparticles on microphytobenthic Biofilms and consequences on the Carbon cycle Abstract: Intertidal and shallow subtidal zones are key areas for biochemical transformations, and particularly they play a crucial zone in the carbon cycle. In soft-bottom areas, most primary production is performed by photosynthetic microorganisms organised in biofilms, and called microphytobenthos. The organic matter they produce is rapidly respired by bacteria or consumed by higher trophic levels. Together, microphytobenthos and bacteria realise most carbon transformation in these areas, and are therefore important groups to study in a view to understand carbon cycling in coastal zones. Coastal areas are currently under influence of numerous stressors linked to anthropogenic effects. The impacts of \u2018well established\u2019 pollutants, e.g. metals, oils, nitrogen, are fairly well understood; however there is now evidence that new compounds, products of advanced technology, have the potential to disrupt the environment. The aim of this project is to understand how a recently developed family of compounds, namely nanoparticles (NPs), influences the development of biofilms and their impact on the carbon cycle. NP concentrations are increasing dramatically in the environment, but their effect on organisms and ecosystems is currently poorly described. Yet, genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of NPs have been demonstrated, including on microorganisms. In this project, laboratory and field experiments will be performed to characterise the effects of NPs on microphytobenthos and bacteria, on their trophic interactions and on their roles in carbon and nutrient cycles. Two common types of NPs will be tested in a wide range of environmental conditions, to decipher in which conditions NPs are more or less harmful to organisms and processes. Such understanding will allow developing strategies to reduce the impacts of NPs and will be beneficial to environment and human well-being in EU and elsewhere.","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

The kentia palm (Howea forsteriana), is one of the most widely exported houseplants in the world and is worth over seven million euros per year in the Dutch horticultural industry alone. Wild kentias are only found on a 12km2 island in the middle of the Tasman Sea, Lord Howe Island (LHI). LHI is a unique ecosystem. It is the focus of the applicant's ERC Advanced Grant, who is using the kentia palms as a model to tackle 'Darwin's mystery of mysteries'. During our expeditions on LHI, we have also discovered a new mutant variety of the kentia palm: instead of having the typical dark green colouration, it has a bright red stem.  Red-stemmed varieties of palms are known, but have had very limited commercialisation due to climatic restrictions: these palms are tropical species, requiring high humidity and temperature. In contrasts, kentias are very hardy and grow well under low light and cool temperatures, hence their immense success as decorative items across innumerable indoor public venues and households. In addition, red is an auspicious colour in Asia \u2013 and we know our new red kentia palm has tremendous horticulture potential. Building on our genetic research and experiments with these kentia palms, we propose to disentangle the biological underpinning of the red stem. In parallel, we will conduct a market research. Examining our IPR position and strategy, we will take the necessary steps to protect our variety, including its registration as Ornamental  Crop  to the Community  Plant Variety  Office.

{"text":"Title: AstroModulation - Astroglial control of axonal excitability, adaptation and  analogue signalling Abstract: Evidence has been emerging for astrocytes to play an important role in neuronal cooperation and information processing in the brain. Recent work has suggested that their activity may even regulate the shape of action potentials in the axon and thus the efficacy of synaptic transmission. However, the underlying physiological machinery remains poorly understood. We propose here that astrocytes play an active role in the analogue-digital regulation of presynaptic signalling. To decipher the role of astroglia in presynaptic signalling, in particular analogue-digital axonal information transfer, we focus on the giant mossy-fibre-CA3 synapse, well characterized in the host laboratory. Our working hypothesis is that astrocytes regulate spike generation and propagation in axons by modulating local extracellular potassium and possibly by releasing glutamate. To test this hypothesis, an innovative set of technique will be used: i) direct recordings of astrocytes and either presynaptic or postsynaptic elements of the synapse in the mossy-fibre to CA3 synapse; ii) genetic tools allowing specific targeting and stimulation of either astrocytes or neurons; iii) pioneering imaging tools, such as FLIM, to directly measure the calcium entry and glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter to reveal glutamate release by the astrocytes. The proposed project should unravel the mechanisms by which astrocytes control axonal information transfer in neural networks axonal excitability while shedding light on poorly understood features of astrocyte physiology.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

These materials are low-cost, based on most earth-abundant elements and eco-friendly materials, and can impact positively European industry and society by converting wasted heat into electricity. \nAs GEN2 TE materials are attracting a growing interest, pilot lines resulting from partnerships between public research institutes, industrial research teams and SME are emerging in Europe. \nThe aim of the INTEGRAL project is to upscale the GEN2 TE material technology using existing pilot lines and growing SMEs, in order to address mass markets TE needs (automotive, heavy duty trucks, autonomous sensors and industry waste heat recovery).

INTEGRAL will allow the industry to step up towards advanced manufacturing and commercialization of systems integrating multifunctional TE materials (on a nano-based approach), through material customization, next techniques for characterization and process control and up-scaled pilot-line demonstrations of reliability, reproducibility and mastered material consumption. Furthermore, the large-scale processes which will be developed for producing nanostructured materials within the INTEGRAL project will explore a wider range of applications outside thermoelectrics, in particular where customization of electrical or thermal properties of sintered or casted materials are needed.

{"text":"Title: SFSASP - Structural and Functional Studies of ATRX- Syndrome Protein Abstract: The eukaryotic genome is packaged into chromatin, which needs to be unpacked to provide necessary access by cellular factors for varied cellular functions. However, DNA can be rendered accessible by the action of energy-consuming chromatin remodelling proteins. One such protein is ATRX that harbours an N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) and a C-terminal helicase domain that confers ATPase activity and identifies ATRX as a member of the snf2 family member of chromatin remodellers. ATRX has been shown to localize in vivo with constitutive heterochromatin in pericentromeric regions as well as telomeres where it works in complex with DAXX for the deposition of the Histone3.3. Mutations in the ATRX gene give rise to ATR-X syndrome, a severe X-linked mental retardation syndrome often accompanied by alpha-thalassemia. Mounting evidence links ATRX mutations to cancer and to malignancies that depend on a telomerase-independent pathway of telomere maintenance called the \u2018alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway, linking ATRX to aging. Despite these advances however, there is lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism of ATRX and of its role within these pathologies. The proposed research aims to investigate the structural and functional properties of ATRX, and to define at a molecular level how it interacts with DAXX to remodel chromatin. We will use a combination of biophysical techniques like NMR, Isothermal Calorimetry and western blotting to characterize ATRX interaction with partner proteins. X-ray crystallography, Cryo-electron microscopy and Small angle X-ray scattering techniques will be used to elucidate the structure of ATRX complexes. We will also design assays to measure the enzymatic activity of the ATRX snf2 domain by itself and in presence of DNA and\/or its interacting partners.

Ketoreductases (KREDs) capable of reduction of ketones to the corresponding secondary alcohol have been improved through classical directed evolution campaigns but a limiting factor has always been the challenge of matching selection conditions to the final scaled-up reaction. Here we propose a solution to that problem.  The Host group previously described the formation of gel-shell beads, agarose beads surrounded by a size-selective shell (Nature Chemistry 2014, 6:791). The beads allow screening of individual members of an enzyme library using flow cytometry.  As small molecules can be readily exchanged, while enzymes are retained, the process not only affords precise control over selection conditions but also makes it ideal for continuous flow processes. To support this endeavour, sensitive assays for the high throughput detection of ketoreductase activity and enantioselectivity will be developed. Directed evolution will then be performed with selection for the efficient use of macromolecular derivatives of the NAD(P)H cofactor and improved tolerance to high substrate \/solvent concentrations.

The overall aim of the proposed research is to advance my career through the completion of the present research project, which examines the rise of the use of online video for proselytization purposes and the emergent role of MCMMs in organized religious institutions. From online sermons to ISIS beheadings, online video-sharing platforms are today a central arena in which MCMMs of different faiths compete for users' attention and attempt to disseminate their religious creeds. This raises the question: how do established religious institutions act to shape users' worldviews and renegotiate authority on a global level via online video-mediated communication? To investigate the ways that religious institutions construct users' experience and negotiate its meanings on new media platforms, the study focuses on the Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova's online activities. Drawing upon the legacies of both Semiotics and Sociology of Religion, this study proposes an innovative socio-semiotic approach which combines semiotic analysis of video with web content analysis and workplace ethnography. This analytical method has been designed to enable the description of the new ways in which religious imagery is strategically constructed and disseminated through the Internet.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: MACROPRU - Investigating new policies for financial stability that do not create inequality Abstract: \"The primary aim of the action is to investigate how new macroprudential policies can influence financial stability without contributing to inequality in society. In this project we aim to apply cutting-edge, agent-based simulation techniques to uncover the redistributive effects of macroprudential policies and to examine the combination optimality of the macroprudential tools from the social welfare perspective. The results of this project will complement the conclusions extracted from the ECB system-wide stress-testing exercises by providing data on the rise of inequality in EU countries due to the adoption of new financial regulations. It will also supplement the macroeconomic impact assessment for the Basel III reforms (cost-benefit \"\"Growth-at-Risk\"\" approach). \n\nThis project expands our knowledge about a new, innovative tool, namely agent-based modeling, that can be used in financial oversight. It provides us with the practical knowledge of how to take into account the heterogeneity of the agents in the models and how to apply new Bayesian estimation techniques. The results of the project may guide policymakers and central bankers on how to reshape financial regulations and to calibrate macroprudential policies in order to minimize adverse social effects and to reduce inequality (by supporting a social policy). The project is consistent with the European Commission\u2019s support on research programmes on the public sector and social innovation that is described in the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative Innovation Union. \n\nThe researcher will be fully integrated into Prof. J. Doyne Farmer\u2019s team at the INET Oxford and at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. The Curie IF will give the applicant the opportunity to perform relevant and state-of-the-art research in the best institute of complexity economics in the world, to re-enforce her position as an independent research group leader and to initiate new long-term collaborations.\"","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: SMARTsurg - SMart weArable Robotic Teleoperated Surgery Abstract: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) offers many advantages when compared to traditional MIS, including improved vision, precision and dexterity. While the popularity of RAMIS is steadily increasing, the potential for improving patient outcomes and penetrating into many procedures is not fully realised, largely because of serious limitations in the current instrumentation, control and feedback to the surgeon. Specifically, restricted access, lack of force feedback, and use of rigid tools in confined spaces filled with organs pose challenges to full adoption. We aim to develop novel technology to overcome barriers to expansion of RAMIS to more procedures, focusing on real-world surgical scenarios of urology, vascular surgery, and soft tissue orthopaedic surgery. A team of highly experienced clinical, academic, and industrial partners will collaborate to develop: i) dexterous anthropomorphic instruments with minimal cognitive demand ii) a range of bespoke end-effectors with embedded surgical tools using additive manufacturing methods for rapid prototyping and testing utilizing a user-centred approach, iii) wearable multi-sensory master for tele-operation to optimise perception and action and iv) wearable smart glasses for augmented reality guidance of the surgeon based on real-time 3D reconstruction of the surgical field, utilising dynamic active constraints and restricting the instruments to safe regions. The demonstration platform will be based on commercial robotic manipulators enhanced with the SMARTsurg advanced hardware and software features. Testing will be performed on laboratory phantoms with surgeons to bring the technology closer to exploitation and to validate acceptance by clinicians. The study will benefit patients, surgeons and health providers, by promoting safety and ergonomics as well as reducing costs. Furthermore, there is a potential to improve complex remote handling procedures in other domains beyond RAMIS.","gt":false,"conf":0.8}
{"text":"Title: REGREEN - Fostering nature-based solutions for smart, green and healthy urban transitions in Europe and China Abstract: Urban systems globally experience significant and interlinked societal challenges including pressures on public health and well-being and growing inequalities and social disruption. At the same time, urban systems are particularly vulnerable to impacts of climate change and suffer from degraded or lack of natural ecosystems to help alleviate these impacts. A promising approach to deal with these challenges is to work with nature\u2019s capacity and qualities in a sustainability perspective. Working with nature in urban settings has advantages over other approaches: multi-functionality, multi-benefits and cost-effectiveness. Nature Based Solutions (NBS) are interventions that seek to restore, improve, enhance or conserve natural capital and biodiversity in terms of habitats or ecosystems. Subsequently, these ecosystems provide enhanced multiple ecosystem services that contribute to social and economic benefits, reducing the urban societal challenges. They can help build climate resilience in cities, improve liveability, and in collaboration with other urban priorities contribute to building inclusive communities, closing social equality gaps, while promoting innovative businesses and jobs.  The aim of Regreen is to generate evidence for how Nature-based solutions (NBS) underpinned by improved urban governance, and public and private participation can systematically integrate ecosystem services and biodiversity and advocate their benefits and values in urban planning to meet societal challenges including climate change resilience, public health and well-being, and social inclusion. Co-creation with urban planners, citizens and business in urban living labs and educational programs for children ensure long-term sustainability of solutions, and support to business development assist further realization.  This to accelerate the crucial transition toward smart, green and healthy cities in Europe and China.","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

{"text":"Title: CCLAD - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage Abstract: The way in which normative principles (\u201cnorms\u201d) matter in world politics is now a key area of international relations research. Yet we have limited understanding of why some norms emerge and gain traction globally whereas others do not. The politics of loss and damage related to climate change offers a paradigm case for studying the emergence of - and contestation over - norms, specifically justice norms. The parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have recently acknowledged that there is an urgent need to address the inevitable, irreversible consequences of climate change. Yet within this highly contested policy area - which includes work on disaster risk reduction; non-economic losses (e.g. loss of sovereignty);  finance and climate-related migration - there is little consensus about what loss and damage policy means or what it requires of the global community, of states and of the (current and future) victims of climate change. Relying on an interdisciplinary theoretical approach and an ethnographic methodology that traverses scales of governance, my project - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD) - will elucidate the conditions under which a norm is likely to become hegemonic, influential, contested or reversed by introducing a new understanding of the fluid nature of norm-content. I argue that norms are partly constituted through the practices of policy-making and implementation at the international and national level. The research will examine the micro-politics of the international negotiations and implementation of loss and damage policy and also involves cross-national comparative research on domestic loss and damage policy practices. Bringing these two streams of work together will allow me to show how and why policy practices shape the evolution of climate justice norms. CCLAD will also make an important methodological contribution through the development of political ethnography and \u201cpractice-tracing\u201d methods.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: ECOLE - Experience-based Computation: Learning to Optimise Abstract: The overall theme of our proposed doctoral programme is ECOLE: Experience-based COmputation: Learning to optimisE. It seeks novel synergies between nature inspired optimisation and machine learning to address new challenges that arise in industry due to the increasing complexity of products, product development and production processes. The unique aspect of ECOLE is to study and capture the notion of experience that is associated with expert engineers, who have worked on complex optimisation tasks for a certain time, in a computational framework composed of machine learning and optimisation strategies. We aim at developing cutting-edge optimisation algorithms that can continuously accumulate experience by learning from development projects both over time and across different problem categories. The more such algorithms are used for different optimisation problems, the better they become since their accumulated experience increases. The Consortium consists of two world-leading universities, the University of Birmingham (UK) and the University of Leiden (The Netherlands), both in the top 150 in the 2016-17 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and two innovative companies, Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH (Germany) in the automotive sector and NEC Europe Ltd (UK) in the ICT sector. All have world-leading research groups with complementary expertise that support ECOLE. ECOLE fills an urgent need in Europe for highly skilled optimisation and machine learning experts who have first-hand industrial experiences allowing sustainable know-how growth for solving future challenges. Its entire training programme is centred around a set of novel research projects proposed for early stage researchers (ESRs), complemented by domain knowledge training, hands-on engineering training and transferable skill training.

{"text":"Title: FOODHABITS - Empirical evidence on the formation of habits, self-control and non-separabilities in food choices Abstract: The proposed research aims to improve our understanding of individual choices over which foods to purchase. The research aims to make fundamental contributions to models of choice and preference formation, and the outputs will inform the development of policy interventions that seek to improve nutritional outcomes. Our particular interest will be to better understand: (i) the importance of the foods available at home in childhood in influencing choices that young adults make over which foods to eat, (ii) the relevance of temptation and self-control in explaining poor nutritional food choices, and the ways that advertising might influence these behaviours, and (iii) the important interactions that exist between the ways that people spend their time (for example work and physical activity) and the food choices that they make and how this determines nutritional outcomes. \n\nA proper understanding of the way that preferences are formed, and the ways that they might be influenced, is key to the design of effective public policy. The food market is a good place to study these questions for a number of reasons. First, people make decisions with high frequency and in different economic conditions, which helps provide variation needed for identification of key parameters of interest. Second, we observe the same individuals making choices both for immediate consumption and for future consumption, which will also help us with identification. Third, the food industry is of considerable policy interest. People in developed countries are getting fatter at an alarming rate. To the extent that people do not take account of the effects of this on themselves in the future and on others then they are making suboptimal decisions; they and society could potentially be made better off by policy intervention, but it is important that we have a good understanding of what impact these interventions are likely to have.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: CLASP - A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry Abstract: As elsewhere in Europe, Anglo-Saxon England saw a development from an oral, vernacular, native, and pagan culture to one that was primarily literate, Latinate, imported, and Christian; and such a transition is clearest in Anglo-Saxon verse. CLASP will focus on all surviving verse of Anglo-Saxon England, composed in Old English and Anglo-Latin over a period of over four centuries (c. 670\u20131100 CE), and produce for the first time an online and interactive consolidated library, marked up through TEI P5 XML to facilitate the identification of idiosyncratic features of sound, metre, spellings, diction, syntax, formulas, themes, and genres across the entire corpus, so forging connections and suggesting more certain chains of influence both within and between the two main literary languages of Anglo-Saxon England. The bilingual corpus comprises almost 60,000 lines of poetry, with about half surviving in each language, and mostly appearing in only a single witness, usually in manuscript. More than fifty named poets are identified, many of them dateable with more or less precision, whose influence on each other can be closely documented, while in the case of anonymous verse, most of which is in Old English, the focus will be on tracing potential influence between texts, to establish a comparative rather than an absolute chronology. CLASP will use the full panoply of digital resources, including sound- and image-files where relevant, to make the oldest surviving poetry in England available to a modern audience for unprecedented kinds of exploration, comprehensive analysis, and interrogation, and in a series of conferences, workshops, and other publications will show the potential of such a comprehensive multilingual corpus to revolutionize perspectives not only on Anglo-Saxon England, but elsewhere in Europe, where Latin and the vernacular likewise co-existed in a Christian context across centuries.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Earth materials control the feasibility of subsurface energy storage, geothermal energy extraction, and are a source of critical elements for future-proof battery technologies. However, perturbations to geological systems can also result in hazards, such as human-induced earthquakes. If we want to tackle the current, pressing scientific questions related to sustainable development for a circular economy, there is an urgent need to make multi-scale, multi-dimensional characterisations of earth materials available to a broad spectrum of earth-science disciplines. In addition to the society-relevant topics, the properties of earth materials determine how the Earth works on the most fundamental level.\nTo overcome this challenge, 15 European facilities for electron and X-ray microscopy join forces to establish EXCITE (Electron and X-ray microscopy community for structural and chemical imaging techniques for earth materials). The collective aim of the EXCITE starting community is to enable access to high-end microscopy facilities and to join the knowledge and experience from the different institutions. By doing so, EXCITE will develop community-driven technological imaging advancements that will strengthen and extend the current implementation of leading-edge microscopy for earth-materials research. In particular, the EXCITE strategy is to integrate joint research programmes with networking, training, and trans-national access activities, to enable both academia and industry to answer critical questions in earth-materials science and technology. As such, EXCITE builds a community of highly qualified earth scientists, develops correlative imaging technologies and provides access to world-class facilities to particularly new and non-expert users that are often hindered from engaging in problem-solving microscopy of earth-materials.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Currently, replica metallography is used to inspect these components. This method can only detect surface defects however evidence indicates that creep damage develops first inside the pipe wall and does not appear at the wall surface until the pipe is almost ready to fail. This results in catastrophic component failures which cost the industry more than \u20ac500,000 in lost revenue per day out of operation. \nTo combat this, we will commercialise the CreepUT system, which employs a proprietary Ultrasonic (UT) technique that enables the early detection of sub-surface creep damage. We are an industrially driven consortium with significant expertise in field inspection services and NDT product development. We have already tested and validated the capabilities of CreepUT in relevant environment but require about \u20ac2.5 million to evolve our system from TRL-6 to TRL-9 and speed-up the delivery of the CreepUT product into the market place. We plan to refine the hardware electronics and make our system more ergonomic to be used by technicians. \n\nA major part of the project is focused on validating the performance of the system in an industrial power plant; in this effort, we are supported by PPC, one of Greece\u2019s top energy companies.

Although important progress has been made in both detection and treatment, there is persisting inequity in progress to reduce its burden. Screening programmes vary substantially between countries and in most long-term effectiveness of screening has not yet been assessed. The objective of EU-TOPIA is to systematically evaluate and quantify the harms and benefits of the running programmes for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in all European countries, and identify ways to improve health outcomes and equity for citizens. We will first identify significant inequities in screening outcomes by assessing the key set of quality indicators for benefits and harms in each country. Using these indicators, outcomes and cost-effectiveness of existing cancer screening programmes in 2015 will be estimated. For this, state-of-the-art models of the natural history of the cancers will be constructed, using country-specific data with and from country-specific experts. Barriers hindering implementation of optimal screening programs will be assessed, leading to road maps for  improved screening. These road maps contain feasible changes, e.g., to extend or reduce the program, to change the screen test used or change key quality indicators, to perform activities that reduce screen-related harm or incorporate new developments in screening, and provide policymakers with evidence for increased, decreased or optimized use of screening. Capacity for self-evaluation of screening will be built using three web-based tools (monitoring, model-quantification and barrier assessment) explained and trained in workshops with country representatives, also from the Associated Countries. The project will lead to reduced inequity, reduced number of cancer deaths and over-diagnosed cases, and increase in life years gained and better cost-effectiveness by 2025.

{"text":"Title: ES-Cat - Directed Protein Evolution for Synthetic Biology and Biocatalysis Abstract: ES-Cat will use directed evolution as a tool to reproduce Nature's remarkable ability to generate molecular machines - in particular enzymes \u2013 that perform at levels near perfection. Instead of seeing rational and combinatorial approaches as alternatives, we combine them in this network to achieve a \u2018smarter\u2019 and more efficient exploration of protein\nsequence space. By harnessing the forces of Darwinian evolution and design in the laboratory we want to (i) screen large and diverse libraries for proteins with improved and useful functions, (ii) optimize existing proteins for applications in medicine or biotechnology and (iii) provide a better understanding of how existing enzymes evolved and how\nenzyme mechanisms can be manipulated. This Network brings together leading academic and industrial groups with diverse and complementary skills. The range of methodologies represented in ES-Cat allows an integrated approach combining in silico structural and sequence analysis with experimental high-throughput screening selection methods (phage-, ribozyme and SNAP display, robotic liquid handling, lab-on-a-chip\/microfluidics) with subsequent systematic kinetic and biophysical\nanalysis. This integration of methods and disciplines will improve the likelihood of success of directed evolution campaigns, shorten biocatalyst development times, and make protein engineering applicable to a wider range of industrial targets. It will also train the next generation of creative researchers ready to fill roles in tailoring enzymes and other proteins for industrial application in synthetic biology efforts to move towards a bio-based economy, rivaling advances that are being made in the US and allowing the EU economy to harvest its evident socio-economic benefits.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Although the laser system to be\ndeveloped within HIPERDIAS can address other material processing applications, the focus here will be 3D structuring of\nsilicon at high-speed, precision processing of diamond material and fine cutting of metal for the watch and the medical\nindustry. Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) approach based on highly efficient compressors gratings will be implemented in\norder to minimize the overall losses of the laser system. The final targets of the project are to demonstrate:\n- a 10-times increase of ablation rate and productivity of large area 3D-structuring of silicon\n- a 10 times increase of speed in fine cutting metals\n- an increase of process speed (6-10 times) at a low processing tools cost of diamond machining\nTherefore, the laser parameters, as well as the beam shaping, beam guiding (based on Kagom\u00e9 fibers) and machine\nsystems will be developed and optimized to fulfill the above manufacturing targets.

{"text":"Title: INVASIoN - Impact of invasive alien true bug species in native tropich webs Abstract: Insects can be accidentally introduced into non-native ecosystems by humans, or expand their geographical range toward the poles as a consequence of global warming. As they invade new environments, exotic species interact with local species, modifying the structure of local food webs. New associations arising from with biological invasions can impact the strength of existing links with effects cascading through trophic levels. When invasive species are herbivores that can attack economically important crops, they can cause serious economic losses. For example, recent invasion of the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) (Halyomorpha halys) in Europe and North America has the potential to interfere with local trophic webs and poses a serious threat to several agro-ecosystems. \nIn this project, we will adopt a multidisciplinary approach to study the ecological consequences of BMSB invasions. In particular, we will focus on the effect of alien herbivore invasion on local natural enemies using the following work packages: 1) the impact of exotic herbivores on infochemical communication between plants, herbivores and natural enemies; 2) Learned responses of parasitoids to infochemical evolutionary traps in a climate change context; 3) Contest behaviour of local egg parasitoids for possession of co-evolved and non-coevolved hosts; 4) Patch time allocation of local egg parasitoids after alien herbivore invasion: behavioural and modelling approaches; 5) Molecular aspects of indirect plant defences against invasive and local species 6) Genetic structure of invasive alien herbivores across Europe and North America\nThe proposed research will be of great relevance for the RISE call as it will be an unparalleled opportunity for complementary European and Canadian research groups to join forces, resulting in the development of lasting research collaborations, the transfer of knowledge between research institutions and improving research potential at the European and global levels.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: HyStorIES - Hydrogen Storage In European Subsurface Abstract: Renewable hydrogen combined with large scale underground storage enables transportation of energy through time, balancing out the impacts of variable renewable energy production. While storing pure hydrogen in salt caverns has been practiced since the 70s in Europe, it has never been carried out anywhere in depleted fields or aquifers.\n\nTechnical developments are needed to validate these two solutions. As subsurface technical feasibility studies for a future hydrogen storage in depleted field or aquifer will be site-specific, as for other geology related activities, HyStories will provide developments applicable to a wide range of  possible future sites: the addition of H2-storage relevant characteristics in reservoir databases at European scale; reservoir and geochemical modelling for cases representative of European subsurface, and tests of this representativeness by comparing it with results obtained with real storage sites models; and lastly an extensive sampling and microbiological lab experiment programme to cover a variety of possible conditions.\n\nComplementarily, techno-economic feasibility studies will provide insights into underground hydrogen storage for decision makers in government and industry. Modelling of the European energy system will first define the demand for hydrogen storage. Environmental and Societal impact studies will be developed. For a given location and hydrogen storage demand, a high-level cost assessment for development of each of the competing geological storage options at that location will be estimated, and the sites will be ranked based on techno-economic criteria developed within the project. Finally, several case studies will enable consideration of the implementation of potential projects, notably by considering their economic interest.\n\nThis will provide substantial insight into the suitability for implementing such storage across EU and enable the proposition of an implementation plan.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

The integration with existing hardware sensors and SCADA systems, allows the system to control the plant automatically within design operating parameters and reacting in real-time to variable (diurnal and seasonal) loading or toxic events. The cloud-based implementation creates a central data repository accessible for operational purposes (remote access, alerts) and management purposes (benchmarking, continuous improvement, and design of new installations). The original prototype (TRL6) was tested in Anglian Water\u2019s Milton (Cambridge) wastewater treatment plant and gave operators information about the status of the active component (biomass) so that manual interventions could be made to improve efficiency. The project aims to take the technology forward, automate the process to a higher degree and demonstrate the solution in a large-scale pilot with four wastewater utilities over 10 plants across Europe and the USA (TRL 8).

{"text":"Title: ReaDoubt - Reasonable Doubt: An epistemological and psychological approach Abstract: The purpose of this research is to shed light on the nature and dynamics of doubt and confidence in complex epistemic decision-making, through a study of the notion of reasonable doubt. While doubt is considered a rational virtue, waiting until complete certainty before accepting and acting upon a given hypothesis is unreasonable in many contexts. Given some evidential support for the hypothesis, the threshold beyond which acceptance rather than doubt is the reasonable option seems to depend on the decisional context (particularly the cost of a possible error): jurors in criminal trials should thoroughly consider alternative scenarios before convicting a defendant; doctors or policy-makers, however, may have to take action upon less strongly confirmed hypotheses, depending on the relative costs and benefits of action\/inaction. Such a decision-theoretic view of reasonable doubt relies on the assumption that the consequences of an hypothesis are exogenous to the rational evaluation of its evidential support: one first updates one\u2019s degree of belief in view of the evidence, and then assesses whether, given the context, the hypothesis is beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. should be accepted and acted upon). But is it the case that agents\u2019 degrees of confidence in a hypothesis, and their weighing of various pieces of evidence, are impermeable to the decisional context? Is the juror\u2019s actual belief independent from her having to bring a consequential verdict? This research aims to study the epistemological norms of reasonable doubt, taking account of the psychological reality of the agents\u2019 reasoning. The main objective of the fellowship is to develop an original empirical research programme, testing the effects of the consequentiality of epistemic decisions on reasoning. This interdisciplinary project requires the candidate, an expert philosopher, to acquire experimental skills and knowledge in psychology, under the supervision of a specialist in the psychology of reasoning.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: ImmunAID - Immunome project consortium for AutoInflammatory Disorders Abstract: Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAID) encompass several rare disorders characterised by extensive clinical and biological inflammation. SAID are caused by the dysregulation of the innate immune system. Due to numerous and unspecific symptoms, tentative diagnosis often leads to failure\/delay and inadequate treatments. ImmunAID will deliver a method for rapid and accurate diagnosis across all the spectrum of SAID, in order to improve clinical management of SAID patients. Thanks to parallel analyses run on samples from more than 600 patients with monogenic or undiagnosed SAID collected throughout Europe, Immunaid will generate a unique and comprehensive set of data, based on unbiased multiomics approaches (gene, transcript, protein, microbiome), and hypothesis-driven assays exploring inflammasome, inflammation resolution and immune networks. A centralised data management strategy will enable to conduct integrated analyses for diagnostic biomarker identification. In a discovery phase, semi-supervised clustering of omics data will be combined to supervised analysis of pathway-related data to provide robust classification and strong link to clinical features\/impact. The related biomarkers will further be validated externally on independent samples and cohorts. Overall, ImmunAID will disentangle the spectrum of SAID, and propose a new omics- and pathogenesis-based SAID classification associated to a clinical decision making algorithm implementable in daily practice. An efficient dissemination plan will target e.g. guideline-forming bodies, the medical community and patients with the help of the ERN RITA and with the objective of turning our results into clinical practice. To further support this, proactive innovation management will be implemented.

Every year, thousands of individuals claim asylum in Europe based on their SOGI, and more often than not their claims are treated unfairly, especially considering the disproportionately high rate of refusals on these grounds. There have been very limited attempts to address this issue, and this research will overcome this gap by carrying out a study more comprehensive than any other done in this field in the past, and producing outcomes that are unparalleled in terms of their reach. \n\nMy main objectives are: 1) to analyse how SOGI related claims are adjudicated in different asylum legal European frameworks (EU, CoE, Germany, Italy, UK), and 2) to produce detailed policy recommendations in regard to the national, European Union and Council of Europe asylum adjudication systems, to the effect of developing a system that addresses adequately the socio-cultural, gender identity and sexual diversity of asylum-seekers. \n\nFor the first time, a combined comparative, interdisciplinary (socio-legal), human rights and empirical approach will be adopted to research this field, which requires a substantial long period of research and sustained funding. This approach ensures the unique character of the findings and their impact on improving the current law, policy and decision-making regarding SOGI asylum claims, which are increasingly under close scrutiny across Europe.

{"text":"Title: SAPTiMeC - Semi-Autonomous ProtoTissues capable of photo-Mechano-Chemical transduction Abstract: Recently, researchers in the field of bottom-up synthetic biology have developed different models of non-living cell-like entities, termed protocells. Protocells are designed to mimic basic aspects of living cells and have potential applications in various emerging technologies. Prototissues comprise networks of protocell consortia that communicate and display synergistic functions. Though the current designs contribute much to the development of bottom-up synthetic biology, they lack robustness and the complexity required to perform higher-order functions. The aim of this proposal is to advance the prototissue design to create prototissues capable of higher-order functions (i.e. photo-mechano-chemical transduction). The prototissues will be created by stratifying and patterning populations of specialised protocells. As a result, the prototissue will be able to self-regulate the amount of luminous energy received from the environment by opening and closing cyclically. This movement enables the prototissue to tune its endogenous photocatalytic reactivity, producing waves of an output chemical signal. The expertise of the applicant in photochemistry, materials and nanomaterials chemistry will be applied to the emerging field of prototissue engineering, area in which the hosting supervisor is an emerging leader. The approach will be focussed on the generation of macroscopic free-standing prototissue sheets with complex architectures. This process will be used to create phototropic prototissues upon exploiting photoresponsive hydrogels encapsulated in their building blocks. The resulting phototropic prototissues will be modified in order to contain building blocks with photocatalytic synthetic proto-organelles. Collectively, the outcome of this proposal will: kickstart a new area of bottom-up synthetic biology; provide a new approach to the construction of out-of-equilibrium systems; and deliver new materials with applications in tissue engineering and soft robotics.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Uniquely it uses a recombinant photoprotein marker and a sophisticated imaging device to detect free calcium ions at the tooth surface, to provide diagnostic and prognostic information on the development and progression of caries lesions (tooth decay). \n\nThere is a significant unmet need in dentistry to differentiate early caries lesions that are actively demineralising from those that are less likely to progress to cavitation. Current state of the art is subjective visual\/tactile examination which leads to active lesions being missed and inactive lesions being unnecessarily restored. Dental practice is gradually moving towards diagnosis\/prevention and away from automatic \u2018drill and fill\u2019 approaches; a shift which will be further enabled by the Calcivis System.\n\nIt is the only product that can directly detect ongoing demineralisation in the clinic which enables:\n- differentiation of active from inactive lesions\n- early detection of incipient active lesions\n- monitoring of therapeutic effectiveness i.e. \u2018switching off\u2019 of activity\n\nTo date, a prototype of the Calcivis System has been used to demonstrate proof of concept in extracted teeth and is now undergoing a pilot safety and performance clinical study.

It will set up the Register on a public multilingual platform and provide resources for career-relevant decision-making (such as career guidelines, CV templates, visualisation and mapping tools for career tracks and status systems, identifier of job equivalents, a community forum). While international academic mobility is growing at high rates and academic systems are rapidly changing, job-seekers as well as recruiting institutions often grapple with the fact that job and status categories in academic institutions (such as PRAG, Akademische R\u00e4tin or Teaching Fellow) are difficult to understand for those coming from other institutions or systems. As a consequence, academics may not recognize the most suitable career paths and academic institutions may not receive the best applications. Responding to a demand from academics, employers, unions, associations and organisations in the higher education sector, the INTAC Register aims to facilitate academic recruitments, make national and international academic job markets more transparent and help academic career planning in the European Research Area. In order to bring the Register to the market, INTAC will create a diversified revenue stream, including regular premium user fees and licensing to academic social media.

This culminates in reduced aerodynamic efficiency and increased structural vibrations, which are noisy and reduce the operating life of aerodynamic devices. To delay flow separations and dynamic stalling, flow control is engaged either actively (artificial means) or passively (natural means). This project describes a novel passive flow control method (Aeropaft) to be applied primarily in the wind turbine (WT) industry, then to aircraft and ground and marine vehicles.\nWind energy is the fastest growing Renewable Energy source (RES) at 24.4% per year. To keep pace with growing demand, there is need for advanced technologies to increase the aerodynamic efficiency. Aeropaft is a simple technology exploiting high velocity currents from near the leading edge (via internal ducts) to re-energise the free-stream flow at the top of an aerofoil. This results in a 5% increase in electrical power yield for a 1MW WT, increase in lift (~16%), reduction of profile drag force (~7%) at higher aerofoil angles of incidences (>12o), and the reduction of wear caused by vibrations. We will penetrate 1% of the global WT market and 10% of the European market. Licensed Manufacturers stand to gain a 0.33% increase in market value and revenue of \u20ac1.72bn, while utility companies gain \u20ac101,013 per annum through savings and increased energy output per WT.

{"text":"Title: EStoPARENTING - Individual Differences in Environmental Sensitivity to Parenting Abstract: Parenting is one of the strongest, most robust and consistent predictors of child development. Although parenting is important for all children, a substantial number of studies provide evidence that some children are more negatively affected by harsh parenting than other children. More recently, it has been shown that some of these \u201cvulnerable\u201d children also benefit more from supportive parenting: they are generally more sensitive to their rearing environment. However, these studies tend to rely on proxy markers of such Environmental Sensitivity (ES). Specifically designed measures of ES do currently not exist. We propose to develop a new observer-rated ES measure in early childhood and, applying this measure, investigate whether more sensitive children are more affected by both negative and positive parenting practices in middle childhood. Furthermore, we will explore associations between this new objective measure of ES and related temperament traits as well as gene variants, applying a multidisciplinary approach. The project is based on existing data from the on-going longitudinal Stony Brook Temperament Study. The Experienced Researcher, with extensive proficiency in parenting research and in the coding of child behaviour, will be trained to undertake this research with the support of the leading experts in the field. This project will significantly advance the field of developmental psychology by providing the first objective measure of sensitivity in early childhood which will allow for more precise empirical testing of Environmental Sensitivity.

The bridging parameter between SGS and macro-scales flow processes is the surface area generation\/destruction occurring during fuel atomisation; relevant SGS closure models will be developed through tailored experiments and DNS and will be implemented into the LES model predicting the macroscopic spray development as function of the in-nozzle flow and surrounding air conditions. Validation of the new simulation tool, currently missing from today\u2019s state-of-the-art models, will be performed against new benchmark experimental data to be obtained as part of the programme, in addition to those provided by the industrial partners. This will demonstrate the applicability of the model as an engineering design tool suitable for IC engines, gas turbines, fuel burners and even rocket engine fuel injectors. The proposed research and training programme will be undertaken by 15ESRs funded by the EU and one ESR funded independently from an Australian partner; ESRs will be recruited\/seconded by universities, research institutes and multinational fuel injection and combustion systems manufacturers that will represent in the best possible way the international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral requirements of the Marie Curie Action guidelines.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: GeoFodder - The scale and significance of early animal husbandry in SW Europe: development of an interdisciplinary high-resolution approach to the investigation of livestock diets and herding practices. Abstract: In the history of early farming, the absolute scale and relative importance of livestock and crop husbandry, their degree of\nintegration, and their landscape impact are largely obscure. To address this issue, GeoFodder will develop for the first time\nan interdisciplinary methodology that integrates geoarchaeological and archaeobotanical techniques for archaeological\nrecognition of leafy browse and leafy fodder (currently not directly detectable) and for assessing the preservation of different\nplant resource types, with the ultimate aim of reconstructing early livestock diet and herding practices. To achieve these\nobjectives, an innovative ethnoarchaeological and experimental programme will study present-day livestock penning\ndeposits (for which herding practices, animal diets and depositional processes are known) to determine how dietary and\nother plant components are altered and partly preserved through ingestion, organic decay and (to sterilize pens) burning.\nThis will generate a suite of geoarchaeological and archaeobotanical proxies, for different plant types (taxa, anatomical\nparts, seasons) with different preservation histories (ingested, decayed, burnt), that will then be applied to analysis of\nprehistoric penning deposits in Iberian caves and rock-shelters. The resulting semi-quantitative data on livestock diet in\nparticular contexts will underpin modelling of the qualitative and temporal dimensions of early livestock grazing\/\nbrowsing and foddering at intra- and inter-site levels to enable assessment of the potential scale of herding and thus of the\nlikely mobility of livestock and relative importance of crops and livestock in early farming. Geofodder will thus advance our\nunderstanding of early livestock husbandry in the SW Mediterranean, contribute to assessment of the long-term landscape\nimpact and sustainability of herding, and establish methodological standards for investigating such questions in other regions\nand periods.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: GEOCOND - Advanced materials and processes to improve performance and cost-efficiency of Shallow Geothermal systems and Underground Thermal Storage Abstract: The 75% of the EU building stock is energy inefficient. Buildings hold a large untapped potential for renewables and energy efficiency in order to decarbonise the EU economy, to ensure security of supply and to provide cost savings to EU households and businesses alike. In this context, Shallow Geothermal Energy Systems (SGES) are a stable, reliable and renewable energy source with some key features compared to many other RES: being available everywhere and being capable of providing not only heating, but also cooling with unparalleled efficiency. Amongst SGES, closed loop systems with vertical Borehole Heat Exchangers enjoy the widest deployment in the EU where the total installed number of GSHP units amounts nowadays to about 1,4 million, representing an installed capacity of about 16.500 MWth. Against this background, there is still a need to remove market barriers and gain competitiveness, but also to develop the next generation of geothermal systems with new materials for penetrating further the market of building construction and renovation. Also the area of District Heating and Cooling needs improved heating and cooling storage technologies which could largely benefit from enhanced Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) technologies. By a smart combination of different material solutions under the umbrella of sophisticated engineering, optimization, testing and on-site validation, GEOCOND will develop solutions to increase the thermal performance of the different subsystems configuring an SGES and UTES. An overall cost reduction of about 25% is the overall aim, leading to a substantial gain in competitiveness. GEOCOND, with a unique consortium of Companies and leading Reseach Institutions in the area of SGES and Materials, will focus on four key development areas in a synergeic and system-wide approach: development of new pipe materials, advanced grouting additives and concepts, advanced Phase Change Materials and system-wide simulation and optimization.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

These behaviors play a major role when individuals from different cultural backgrounds work together to solve disputes or address joint challenges. Yet, we know little about what these behaviors mean in different cultural groups or how they are approached. With HONORLOGIC, I aim to initiate a step-change in our understanding of cultural variation in these important domains of social behavior by providing unique, multimethod, comparative and converging evidence from a wide range of cultural groups. I will answer the question \u201cHow do cultural groups that promote honor as a core cultural value approach coordinating with others, reaching compromise, and offering apologies?\u201d by integrating insights from social\/cultural psychology, behavioral economics, and anthropology. I will do this by collecting quantitative data using economic games, experiments, and surveys from Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Egypt and Tunisia, as cultural groups where honor has been shown to play a defining role in individuals\u2019 social worlds. I will also run the proposed studies in the US, the UK, Japan and Korea to provide a broader comparative perspective. \n\nHONORLOGIC will produce transformative evidence for theories of social interaction and decision making in psychology, economics, and evolutionary science by (a) producing innovative theory and data with an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach, (b) increasing the diversity of the existing evidence pool, (c) testing established theoretical assumptions in new cultural groups, and (d) contributing to capacity building in under-researched cultural groups in psychological research.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: LeaRNN - Principles of Learning in a Recurrent Neural Network Abstract: Forming memories, generating predictions based on memories, and updating memories when predictions no longer match actual experience are fundamental brain functions. Dopaminergic neurons provide a so-called \u201cteaching signal\u201d that drives the formation and updates of associative memories across the animal kingdom. Many theoretical models propose how neural circuits could compute the teaching signals, but the actual implementation of this computation in real nervous systems is unknown. \nThis project will discover the basic principles by which neural circuits compute the teaching signals that drive memory formation and updates using a tractable insect model system, the Drosophila larva. We will generate, for the first time in any animal, the following essential datasets for a distributed, multilayered, recurrent learning circuit, the mushroom body-related circuitry in the larval brain. First,  building on our preliminary work that provides the synaptic-resolution connectome of the circuit, including all feedforward and feedback pathways upstream of all dopaminergic neurons, we will generate a map of functional monosynaptic connections. Second, we will obtain cellular-resolution whole-nervous system activity maps in intact living animals, as they form, extinguish, or consolidate memories to discover the features represented in each layer of the circuit (e.g. predictions, actual reinforcement, and prediction errors), the learning algorithms, and the candidate circuit motifs that implement them. Finally, we will develop a model of the circuit constrained by these datasets and test the predictions about the necessity and sufficiency of uniquely identified circuit elements for implementing learning algorithms by selectively manipulating their activity.\nUnderstanding the basic functional principles of an entire multilayered recurrent learning circuit in an animal has the potential to revolutionize, not only neuroscience and medicine, but also machine-learning and robotics.","gt":false,"conf":0.1}

{"text":"Title: INNOVATE - INtelligeNt ApplicatiOns oVer Large ScAle DaTa StrEams Abstract: Large scale data analytics is the key research domain for future data driven applications as numerous of devices produce huge volumes of data in the form of streams. Analytics services can offer the necessary basis for building intelligent decision making mechanisms to support novel applications. Due to the huge volumes of data, analytics should be based on efficient schemes for querying large scale data partitions. Partitions contain only a piece of data and a dedicated processor manages the incoming queries. The management of continuous queries over data streams is a challenging research issue requiring intelligent methods to derive the final outcome (i.e., query response) in limited time with maximum performance. The management process of continuous queries involves their assignment to specific processors and the processing of the derived responses. We focus on a group of query controllers serving the incoming queries and, thus, becoming the connection of big data systems with the real world. INNOVATE proposes solutions for the management of the controllers behavior. We propose an intelligent decision making process for each controller in three axes: (i) top-down, by realizing a mechanism that assigns queries to the underlying processors; (ii) bottom-up, by proposing decision making mechanisms for returning responses to users\/applications on top of early results; (iii) horizontal, by proposing optimization schemes for queries management. We adopt a pool of learning schemes and an ensemble learning model dealing with how and on which processors each query should be assigned. We also propose specific schemes for combining processors responses. Intelligent and optimization techniques are adopted for the controllers group management. Machine learning, Computational Intelligence and optimization are the key adopted technologies that, when combined, provide efficient solutions to a challenging problem like the support of intelligent analytics over big data streams.","gt":false,"conf":0.9}
{"text":"Title: CORFEDITING - Gene Editing as Therapeutic Strategy for C9ORF72 Linked ALS\/FTD Abstract: Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat G4C2 in the non-coding region of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) is the most common genetic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ALS is a fatal condition characterized by progressive motor deficits, degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) and death from neuromuscular respiratory failure in the majority of afflicted individuals within 3-5 years. Currently, the economic burden of care and treatment for patients with ALS\/FTD is expensive and continues to significantly rise in Europe and worldwide. While significant genetic discoveries have been made in the field, they have not yet translated to treatment options for patients with ALS and FTD. Thus, research efforts aimed at identifying therapeutic targets are of the utmost importance to enable therapeutic development for these devastating disorders. In this ERC Proof of Concept project, we will design, optimise and test gene therapy vectors containing CRISPR\/Cas9 system to selectively remove the pathogenic ALS\/FTD-related C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in mouse models of C9orf72-related ALS, with the ultimate aim of designing a therapy for patients with C9orf72-related ALS\/FTD. The ultimate benefit of this approach goes far beyond just ALS\/FTD however. A successful CNS gene therapy for C9orf72 related disease potentiates the prospect of developing similar approaches to treat multiple disease scenarios amenable to gene modification. Indeed, growing evidence suggests that C9orf72 repeat expansions also contribute to a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease and cerebellar ataxias. We therefore anticipate that our strategy could be beneficial for other neurological conditions.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: MigrantLife - Understanding Life Trajectories of Immigrants and Their Descendants in Europe and Projecting Future Trends Abstract: In recent decades, European countries have witnessed increasing immigration streams and ethnic heterogeneity of their populations. Facilitating immigrant integration and social cohesion has become a major societal issue. The project moves beyond previous research by first investigating how employment, housing and family trajectories evolve and interact in the lives of descendants of post-WWII immigrants and post-1990 immigrants in the UK, France, Germany and Sweden, and how factors related to a societal context, an early life context and critical transitions shape their life histories. Second, the study will project their future life trajectories using innovative simulation techniques, considering the main life domains and diversity between and within immigrant groups. Although recent studies report substantial diversity in employment, in housing and in family patterns among descendants of post-war immigrants and recent immigrants in Europe, the causes of this heterogeneity remain far from clear. Furthermore, it is not known whether observed differences between immigrants and natives are short-term outcomes in a long-term process of cultural and economic integration or rather reflections of different pathways and outcomes for immigrants and their descendants. The project will exploit large-scale longitudinal data from four countries and apply advanced longitudinal methods, including multichannel sequence analysis and multilevel event history analysis. Microsimulation will be applied to project life histories for immigrants and their descendants. The project will significantly deepen our understanding of the relationships between the three life domains, and the causes of less and more successful life trajectories among immigrants and their descendants. This project will show whether the current heterogeneity between and within immigrant and minority groups vanishes over time or rather persists, suggesting an increasing diversity of European societies.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Major sources of methane are both natural (wetlands) and anthropogenic (agriculture, landfills and fossil fuels). Current efforts to assess the anthropogenic CH4 influence on climate change and the effectiveness of mitigation policies for CH4 are limited by large uncertainties in estimates of total methane emissions and their attribution to various sources by accounting-based techniques. This project will pioneer and apply innovative techniques for atmospheric observation and modelling of radiocarbon in CH4 that will enable unique quantification of fossil fuel vs. biogenic CH4 sources at regional and global scales, thereby improving the estimation and attribution of CH4 emissions of different types.

{"text":"Title: EVACUATION - Testing communication strategies to save lives in emergency evacuation Abstract: The EU urgently seeks to improve emergency evacuation preparedness. EU public spaces are getting more crowded. Fires and terrorist attacks require emergency evacuation. Faster evacuation from public buildings during emergencies saves more lives. Observations of actual emergencies show that people tend to be slow to respond to evacuation alarms (taking up to 10 minutes) and take the familiar route out instead of the nearest exit. The EU calls for evidence-based recommendations for evacuations, which are mostly non-existent. The state of the art uses computer models of evacuation speed, but more realism is needed. We take the novel approach of combining state of the art computer modeling with insights from risk communication to improve speed and survival in emergency evacuations. This project aims to: \n1.\tIdentify which risky behaviors occur in emergency evacuations and underlying causes (WP1). \n2.\tUse models to identify communication strategies that improve evacuation time and survival (WP2). \n3.\tTest communication strategies for improving evacuation time and survival in experiments (WP3).\nTo ultimately save lives, Aim 1 involves (a) observing behavior in existing videos of actual evacuations, and (b) interviewing emergency service members about their experiences in actual evacuations. Aim 2 will use \u2018agent-based\u2019 computer modeling, with which the Fellow has experience, to assess the effect of reducing the riskiest behaviors on evacuation time and survival rates.

{"text":"Title: DRmov - Deciphering the RBPome in mosquitoes during virus infection Abstract: The impact of mosquito-borne diseases has expanded dramatically in the last few decades to become an emerging global health problem, with around 1 billion new infections and 1 million deaths each year. In Europe there are more than 20 countries with established populations of invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are the principle vectors responsible for transmitting high-risk pathogens such as ZIKA virus (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHKV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitic virus (VEEV). Despite our vulnerabilities to mosquito-borne diseases, virus replication dynamics is still poorly understood especially in the invertebrate vectors. No treatment against these viruses targeting essential viral proteins are currently available. Thus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and its Vector Control Advisory Group has urged for insect vector control. Vector control is usually performed through insecticides; however, resistance can emerge in mosquitoes leading to persistence of the disease. Therefore, virologists are turning their interests toward host factors that play essential roles in infection as novel antiviral targets, since they can potentially exhibit broad-spectrum efficacy. In particular, scientists envision that genetically modified mosquitoes with disrupted genes required for infection can be re-inserted into natural habitats or through targeting these genes by RNAi in order to control viral spread. As all mosquito-borne viruses have RNA genome, cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) emerge as ideal targets for antiviral therapies, as they are key players in cellular and viral RNA metabolism . Thus, we propose here to profile comprehensively the compendium of mosquito RBPs (RBPome) using RNA-interactome capture (RNA-IC). Furthermore, we will apply different cutting-edge methods to identify the role of mosquito RBPs during virus infection.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Abstract: ReMIND focuses on the potentials for \u2018mind museums\u2019(former asylums turned into museums)to provoke emotional responses in visitors and foster critical reflection on the histories and contemporary problems of dealing with mental illness (MI) in society.Its objective is to fill some relevant scientific gaps on the subject, as well as to conjoin complimentary disciplinary approaches from museum and exhibition design and museum studies and develop new research competence for me as fellow and for the host institution in the field of visitor studies.\nReMIND explores the MI heritage landscape through asylums built in Europe from the mid-19th cent until the 60s\u2019 deinstitutionalisation process in the psychiatric care system.Today, most of these buildings still stand where they were, often completely or partially abandoned, left to decay, and contributing to urban decline.ReMIND will survey the European landscape of MI heritage considering phenomena such as abandonment and reuse of historic asylums for cultural purposes.However, alongside this general desk-based overview, its main aim is to analyse former asylums that have been restored and reused as museums, specifically involving 2 indepth interdisciplinary pilot case studies.Nowadays we don\u2019t have a sense of potentials for the responsible adaptive re-use of asylums and they are in danger.Likewise, once converted into museums, their role in effecting attitudinal change in visitors that may help to dismantle stigma and promote awareness toward MI has not been properly investigated.ReMIND addresses these gaps.\nTo do so my study will integrate various disciplinary approaches to rethink adaptive reuse interventions and contemporary heritage conservation and valorisation practices.I will work at the intersection of different research fields, moving from Italy to UK at New Castle University to learn, deploy and contribute in implementing theories and methodologies related to heritage studies, visitor studies, and display analysis.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: ConPLED - Nanostructured Confined ABX3 Perovskite based Light-Emitting Devices Abstract: The development of low-cost, clean, and scalable energy solutions is imperative to securing a peaceful and sustainable future. Optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) incorporating new, inexpensive materials show tremendous promise to alter the energy landscape by reducing the cost of energy consumption. However, the widespread adoption of LEDs demands new technologies to surpass the luminous efficacies of conventional LED light while having a full control over colour, brightness and directionality of the light source. Recently, a new class of semiconducting materials, ABX3 perovskites, is poised to revolutionise the LED field due to its ease of processing and outstanding electronic and optical properties. In this context, the ultimate goal of this proposal is the development of the first efficient white light LED based on luminescent nanostructured perovskites that feature tuneable on-demand emission properties. ConPLED will result in an alternative to commercial white LEDs, with the additional gain of having finely tuneable electroluminescence based on cost-effective materials processed at low temperature. The combination of perovskite nanocrystals that show quantum confinement effects with photonic nanostructures, an area where the researcher has demonstrated proficiency, will lead to fine control over the colour gamut, and the angular bandwidth of light emission. A deep understanding of the electro-optical and structural properties of such nanostructured emitting materials will lead to demonstrate efficient white light LEDs, which is one of the main activities of the Optoelectronics group at Cavendish Laboratory (University of Cambridge). The project covers the experimental realization of materials and their integration in devices as well as advanced characterization and performance tests, all of which lies in the common ground of physicists, chemists and technologists and, thus, will naturally broaden the area of expertise of the researcher.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: RESOLVE - Reconstructing the History of Lunar Volatiles Abstract: One of the most exciting recent discoveries in the field of Planetary Sciences has been the confirmation of the presence of water and other associated volatiles in the Moon. These findings have come via laboratory measurements of returned lunar samples exploiting the latest advancements in analytical instrumentation and in-situ techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Not only has the latest research revolutionized our understanding of the abundance and distribution of volatiles on the lunar surface and in the lunar interior, but it has also highlighted potential roles of their different sources and processes imparting specific isotopic signatures to lunar volatiles.\n\nRESOLVE aims at understanding how the abundance and the distribution of volatile components, as well as their isotopic composition are influenced by the crystal structure of the host mineral. The volatile-bearing minerals \u2013 primarily phosphates \u2013 respond to pressure increase caused by an impact event through modification of their crystal structures, resulting in not only redistribution of the volatile elements (e.g., H, Cl, F), but also of the stable (e.g., H, D, 37Cl) and radiogenic (e.g., 207Pb) isotopes. Therefore, phosphate minerals have the extraordinary potential to simultaneously provide an opportunity for precise age-determination of an impact event, as well as to track any associated modification in the indigenous isotopic signatures of their volatile components. \n\nOnce we better understand the crystal-chemical-isotopic behaviour of lunar volatiles by a multi-analytical approach combining in-situ elemental, stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry with structural characterization, we can then begin to discriminate between different sources (solar wind, cosmic radiation, etc.) of water and other associated volatiles. This allows us to address one of the remaining puzzles in the inner Solar System - the origin of water.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

These display innovations will be coupled to a highly reliable manufacturing of the backplane. Cheap processes (e.g. based on 0.35 \u00b5m lithography) will be developed and special attention will be given to the interface between the top metal electrode of the CMOS backplane and the subsequent OLED layers. All these developments will be done on a 200 mm wafer scale. Along with this, a new testing procedure for quality control of the CMOS wafer (prior to OLED deposition) will be developed and promoted for standardisation. \n\nThe flexibility of the large area microdisplays will be achieved by wafer thinning to enable a bending radius of 45 mm. Along with the new functionality, the durability of the devices has to be guaranteed despite bending to be comparable to rigid devices. The project will address this by improving the OLED efficiency (e.g. operating lifetime > 15,000 hours) and by modifying the device encapsulation to both fulfil the necessary barrier requirements (WVTR < 10^-6 g\/d m2) and to give sufficient mechanical protection.\nThe demand for and timeliness of these flexible, large area microdisplays is shown by the strong interest of industrial integrators to demonstrate the benefits of the innovative OLED microdisplays.

{"text":"Title: Programmable Matter - New materials enabled by programmable two-dimensional chemical reactions across van der Waals gap Abstract: Chemical reactions between solids are fundamental in areas as diverse as catalysis, information storage, pharmaceuticals, electronics manufacturing, advanced ceramics, and solar energy, to name just a few. Controlling the spatial extent of solid-state reactions at the nanoscale will enable development of materials, programmed on an atomic level, which will facilitate many emerging applications like bioinspired smart batteries and artificial synapses for future neuromorphic electronics. However, currently, there are no chemistry methods which allow precise spatial control at the nanoscale, limiting progress towards the programmable matter.   Here I propose a completely new way to create novel materials using two-dimensional (2D) chemical reactions at the atomically-defined interfaces between crystalline solids. Usually, reactions between macroscopic solids are hindered as their large dimensions prevent placing them close enough to each other to support chemical transformations. Thus, just a few years ago, the task of placing two atomically flat crystals within angstrom proximity of each other, to initiate chemical interactions between them, was impossible to realise. This situation has changed dramatically with the advent of van der Waals technology - disassembly of various layered crystals into individual atom- or molecule-thick layers followed by a highly-controlled reassembly of these layers into artificial heterostructures. Building on our recent progress in van der Waals technology, I aim to realise interplanar chemical reactions between highly-crystalline solids in precisely controllable conditions using temperature, electric and magnetic fields, light, sound, pressure, and mechanical forces as means of control. Using digital control of 2D chemistry, mechanics, and electronics at the nanoscale, I and my team will develop programmable matter that actively responds to external and internal stimuli by adjusting their properties on an atomic level.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: VoidTrap - Advanced studies of trapping and rotation of nanoparticles in vacuum Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to explore new and innovative routes to confine and cool trapped microparticles in vacuum. The elegance of trapping such microparticles in vacuum arises from the absence of any physical contact with the environment leading to any routes of dissipation. The challenge is to hold such particles in strong, highly localised traps, cool them and explore physics at the classical-quantum boundary.\nThe present proposal aims to address these issues with a number of clear routes to address acknowledged bottlenecks in the field. (i) Firstly the use of light propagation in complex media (such as a multimode fibre) combined with vacuum studies leads to an innovative route for trapping, confining and addressing microparticles in complex vacuum systems without the need for \u2018bulk\u2019 microscope objectives or conventional optics. This also facilitates trapping in such geometries and creating with ease loading and 'science' chambers for the proposed research. (ii) A further advance will be the use of nanostructures such as double nanohole arrays for trapping that, due to their strong light confinement lead to ultra-high trap stiffnesses. In turn this means the very high resultant oscillator frequency reduces the cooling needed to achieve the quantum ground state. (iii) Finally a third strand will look at loading antireflection coated particles into such traps. This can result in trap stiffnesses up to one to two orders of magnitude higher than currently seen, again allowing cooling to the ground state.\nThese ideas are disruptive and unconventional and unique to the applicant and host institute to the best of our knowledge. They will result in a step change in the field and internationally leading results. In addition the programme will allow a comprehensive and positive training package for the applicant as a basis for his future career in academia.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: RAMBEA - Realistic Assessment of Historical Masonry Bridges under Extreme Environmental Actions Abstract: The RAMBEA project will develop a novel computational strategy for accurate and efficient simulations of historical masonry bridges subject to extreme environmental actions, including loadings induced by earthquakes and flooding. The aim is to provide a comprehensive tool for realistic assessment with the potential of transforming current practice related to strengthening of critical assets, contributing to an increased resilience of the built environment and the preservation of important elements of the architectural heritage, thus responding to the safety and socio-economic needs highlighted in Horizon 2020.\nOld masonry bridges still play a critical role within the European transportation system. Moreover, they belong to the architectural heritage representing a valuable expression of past construction technology. Many of these structures are located in seismic regions and in areas subject to floods and hydrogeological instability which have been aggravated by climate change. Thus they can be exposed to extreme environmental actions which may potentially lead to bridge failure causing significant economic damage and the loss of structures with cultural and historical value. Currently, the response of masonry bridges under extreme loading is evaluated using simplified models due to the lack of efficient detailed models. However, these approaches do not allow for the complex 3D behaviour potentially leading to unrealistic and unsafe predictions. The main challenge of this project is the development of a more advanced strategy, based on a novel numerical description allowing for the 3D interaction between the different bridge components under extreme loading. More specifically, I will develop an efficient 3D finite element representation with macro-elements for the masonry parts of the bridge, an accurate description for the physical interface between masonry and backfill and an effective model calibration strategy utilising the results of non-destructive tests.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: THIODIV - Exploring thioalkynes potential in gold catalysis with a divergent reactivity manifold Abstract: THIODIV brings together the complementary expertise of Dr Nagnath More (NM, expertise in oxidative reactions and arylation processes) with Dr Paul Davies (Host, expertise in gold catalysis and sulfur-based reaction development). \nGold catalysis attract significant international interest due to its ability to generate metal carbene character from alkynes delivering more sustainable synthesis. Current strategies to address the major challenge of site-selective carbene formation use terminal alkynes, or those with strongly electron-donating- or electron-withdrawing groups. Limitations derive from the gold carbenes environment and its impact on reactivity, or the incorporation of undesired directing groups. THIODIV will study the potential of sulfur-substitution to deliver complementary directing effects while introducing a desirable functional group into the resulting molecule.  Preliminary studies show that sulfur can enable gold-catalysed reactivity, yet propose different directing-modes which lead to different regiocontrol. The overall aim of THIODIV is to examine the role of sulfur substitution on alkynes in gold catalysis and clarify its influence on reactivity, and hence allow wider application of sulfur-directing groups in gold catalysis and synthesis more widely. \nA diversity-generating dynamic reaction manifold will be used to elucidate key control parameters by studying two approaches, an oxidative rearrangement, and an arylative rearrangement. Alongside insight into reaction control and directing effects, THIODIV will provide new and efficient access to motifs that are featured in numerous bioactive compounds and are highly desirable in industry and academia as synthetic intermediates. While addressing fundamental questions of reactivity and control, THIODIV will also equip NM with the skills to incorporate hit- and lead-like properties into structure-reactivity studies to deliver new molecular entities that are applicable in pharmaceutical discovery.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: XYMOF - Artificial Intelligence meets Material Genome: intelligent design of new MOFs for xylene separation challenge. Abstract: Chemical separation technologies consume 15% of the global energy. Separation of xylene, a common chemical produced on an enormous scale, is one of the most difficult cases, due to very similar physical properties of xylene isomers. This project will address this challenge by identifying an adsorptive material with superior selectivity towards the desired isomer, compared to the current state-of-the-art adsorbents. A very selective material, used as a membrane or in the adsorption unit, would make a step-change in the xylene separation technologies and lead to significant energy savings. To achieve this overall objective, I put together a novel computational strategy by combining molecular simulations, data analysis and AI methods. Using this strategy, I will mine tens and hundreds of thousands of real and hypothetical materials that already exist within the Material Genome, a global space of possible materials and their features. The focus of the project will be on Metal-Organic frameworks (MOFs) since they already show a particular promise for difficult separations. Specific scientific objectives of the project aim to i) understand what MOFs are promising for xylene separations ii) what structural features of MOFs are responsible for their specific behaviour iii) and then, using the AI models, design MOFs with superior xylene separation performance. \nThe progress will be enabled by i) an outstanding research environment of the host group, Prof. Sarkisov, and the infrastructure of the University of Manchester; ii) interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaborations with the leading academics and companies (Prof. Goodwin, University of Oxford, Dr. Pullumbi, Air Liquide); iii) excellent training and professional development opportunities.\nTogether, the environment of the fellowship and the pioneering research idea in application to the societally relevant and challenging problem, will make this project a stepping stone for my independent academic career.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: TRIM - Vulnerable trait-combinations in corals and fishes and their management Abstract: Vulnerable trait-combinations in corals and fishes and their management (Traits coRals fIshes Management)\n\nCross-taxon interdependencies govern many key ecosystem services, e.g. pollination, agricultural production and coral reef fisheries. Many of these services are deteriorating; this is especially pressing for coral reefs. Human and climate stress drives declines of global coral reef assets, but the characteristics of the most vulnerable species groups are poorly understood.  Synergistic coral-fish relationships underpin key ecosystem functions on coral reefs, and control how coral reef ecosystems respond to climate and human stress. Emerging theory proposes that redistributions of reef species follow trait-based filtering, where species with certain combinations of traits, or functional types, are more vulnerable to stressors.  Based on biogeographical transition environments and human use gradients as proxies for change, TRIM aims to examine which trait-combinations impart vulnerability to stress in corals and fishes independently and in coral-fish relationships that underpin reef function. Recognising the crucial role that coral-fish relationships play in shaping reef ecosystems, TRIM will discover which traits and functional types linking the two taxa drive their combined vulnerability.  By evaluating the responses of coral and fish communities and their functional types under stress, this project will link this knowledge to potential management objectives and identify actions specific to functional types, where vulnerable organisms are stringently protected and others can still be used.

LBP is the largest cause of morbidity worldwide, yet there remains controversy as to the specific cause leading to poor treatment options and prognosis. LDD is reported to account for 50% of LBP in young adults, but the interplay of factors from genetics, environmental, cellular responses and social and psychological factors is poorly understood. Unfortunately, the integration of such data into a holistic and rational map of degenerative processes and risk factors has not been achieved, requiring creation of professional crosscompetencies, which current training programmes fail to address. Disc4All aims to tackle this issue through collaborative expertise of clinicians; computational physicists and biologists; geneticists; computer scientists; cell and molecular biologists; microbiologists; bioinformaticians; and industrial partners. It provides interdisciplinary training in data curation and integration; experimental and theoretical\/computational modelling; computer algorithm development; tool generation; and model and simulation platforms to transparently integrate primary data for enhanced clinical interpretations through models and simulations. Complementary training is offered in dissemination; project management; research integrity; ethics; regulation; policy; business strategy; and public and patient engagement. The Disc4All ESRs will provide a new generation of internationally mobile professionals with unique skill sets for the development of thriving careers in translational research applied to multifactorial disorders.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Abstract: Society and clinical practice pose a growing demand on novel biomaterials, ICT, micro and nanotechnologies for innovative medical devices and in vitro diagnostics (Medical Technologies-MTs). In addition to the challenge of time, the new technologies are subjected to other pressing factors such as qualification, regulation, cost, biocompatibility and the need to be applicable worldwide. In the most recent years it is obvious that nano-enabled MTs can be applied in nearly every medical area, with a major presence and increased importance in cancer, regenerative medicine, advanced therapies, neurology, cardiology, orthopaedics, and dentistry. On the other hand, any innovation in the Health sector has to be carefully assessed in terms of risk\/benefit ratio. Nano-enabled MTs particularly require careful assessment, since they are complex products group and their technological assessments are still under development.

{"text":"Title: DigiScore - Digital Scores \u2013 investigating the technological transformation of the music score Abstract: Digital scores utilising computational technology and digital media are emerging worldwide as the next evolutionary stage in the concept of the music score (Vear 2019). Yet there has been no scientific study of digital scores; nor their effect upon creativity and musicianship. This is remarkable for two reasons:  First, because digital scores are generating new music experiences, innovative compositional approaches, novel performance opportunities, and broader accessibility for a vast number of musicians and music cultures around the world.  Second, because many topics immediately adjacent or informing digital scores have been theorised thereby liberating these subjects and innovating creative practices, e.g. digital media art, digital performance, electro-acoustic music.  This project will launch the first scientific investigation into the transformation of the music score through computational technologies.  The core aims of the project are to:          (1) determine scientific knowledge of how digital scores stimulate new creative opportunities and experiences within a range of music practices,          (2) develop a theoretical framework for digital scores as an important transdisciplinary area of research,           (3) build a scientific study of inclusive digital musicianship through the transformative potential of the digital score.  This project will investigate these questions through an innovative combination of artistic and scientific research methods, undertaken by a transdisciplinary and international team of scientists and artists, led by a world expert of digital scores: Prof. Dr. Craig Vear.

{"text":"Title: MSMART - Margination of Microcapsules in Small Arteries Abstract: Intravascular delivery of microcapsules is emerging as a novel and effective approach in targeted therapeutic and diagnostic procedures in cancer and cardiovascular diseases. It encapsulates drugs or imaging-contrast agents and functionalizes the surface of the capsule to target specific diseased sites. However, a major challenge in its applications is to improve the adhesion efficiency of capsules to the endothelium (a monolayer of cells that lines the luminal surface of blood vessels) under complex blood flow conditions. While extensive research has focused on identifying disease-associated biomolecules on the endothelium, or suitable antibody\/peptides targeting these molecules, much less attention has been given to the margination of the drug carriers from the blood stream to the vascular wall, especially in arteries where many diseases develop. Margination represents the crucial first step before adhesion. The aim of this project is therefore to investigate the cross-sectional migration of microcapsules in arterial blood flows and to develop scientific understanding of how the size, shape and deformability of capsules, as well as system parameters such as the blood haematocrit, blood flow inertia and pulsatility, and vessel geometry affect the margination of the microcapsules. The project will unit the state-of-the-art in-vitro, ex-vivo experimentation and numerical modeling resolving blood flow at a cellular level. A second aim of the project is to develop practical principles for designing microcapsules with optimum margination property in arteries.

We have recently described that pancreas progenitor cells extracted from adult donors can be expanded long-term in vitro into 3D structures, which we have termed organoids.  Pancreas organoids reproduce in vitro all the features of pancreas ductal epithelia, and have a limitless expansion potential.  Thus, pancreas organoids promise to boost cell therapy of type 1 diabetes.  We have recently observed that progenitor cells organoids preserve their genetic stability over a long time in culture. That represents an advantage, when compared to iPS or hES derived approaches, where genetic instability raises concerns for their future therapeutic applications.  While progenitor organoids are promising for the future of cell therapy, bringing stem cell-based therapies to patients requires a reliable characterization (\u201cknowing what the cells do and how they do it\u201d, i.e. a phenotypic and molecular biology characterization), chemically well-defined culture media, and the capacity of mass-production under GLP\/GMP conditions.\nThe LSFM4LIFE consortium aims to the mass production of pancreas organoids for the cellular therapy of type 1 diabetes.

Despite a large number of currently existing SIBs, their analysis has been mostly focused on policy objectives, financial instruments and corporate governance. However, not all SIBs have been successful in playing strategic policy roles. Reasons are complex: lack of strategic industrial policies, or changes in policy objectives, political interference, changes in sources of funds and corporate strategies, but also, and more importantly, lack or change of internal strategic competences. The project combines evolutionary economics perspective (dynamic capabilities), economics of innovation (financing of innovation) and public governance perspective (policy capacity, bureaucracy) in order to analyse institutional contexts and internal capacities of SIBs. In doing so, the aim of the project is to better understand what makes some SIBs strategic state-backed investors in financing innovation-led growth while others \u2013 less so. The context of multinational governance of the EU adds another unique dimension to the study. European Commission has already expressed the vision to more actively engage National Promotional Finance Institutions in Member States in the next budgetary period 2021-2027.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: COSMOVOID - Cosmology with voids and superclusters: combining theory, simulation and observation Abstract: The aim of this cosmology proposal is to study the contents, history and evolution of our Universe, using the distribution of matter on large scales. I propose to study new methods to identify and catalogue rare voids and superclusters in the large-scale structure of the Universe and to study their statistical, morphological and dynamical properties. I will use these studies to propose new observables and new techniques of data analysis based on these structures, and to use this knowledge to test theories of gravitation, dark energy and the initial conditions of the early Universe. Interest in cosmic voids in particular has increased greatly in recent years, as they have been suggested as extremely competitive probes of cosmology, according to some estimates significantly out-performing other methods. Yet there remain unsolved theoretical difficulties in the modelling of voids and even a lack of consensus on how to identify them and how to relate theory and observation. Even less is currently known about superclusters. These are among the important issues I propose to address. My proposal consists in roughly equal parts of: analysis of the latest high-quality survey data which will available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES); analysis of the state-of-the-art Jubilee ISW and weak lensing simulations run on the Juropa supercomputer in Germany; and theoretical work to combine insights from data and simulation to improve our understanding of cosmology. The proposed work is to be carried out in collaboration with leading experts in the respective fields from across the European Community, in particular in the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

We will focus on three major CID indications with distinct characteristics, yet a large overlap of their molecular risk map: inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematodes and rheumatoid arthritis. We have joined 15 partners from major cohorts and initiatives in Europe (e.g.IHEC, ICGC, TwinsUK and Meta-HIT) to investigate human data sets on three major levels of resolution: whole blood signatures, signatures from purified immune cell types (with a focus on CD14 and CD4\/CD8) and selected single cell level analyses.  Principle data layers will comprise SNP variome, methylome, transcriptome and gut microbiome. SYSCID employs a dedicated data management infrastructure, strong algorithmic development groups (including an SME for exploitation of innovative software tools for data deconvolution) and will validate results in independent retrospective and prospective clinical cohorts. \nUsing this setup we will focus on three fundamental aims : (i) the identification of shared and unique \"\"core disease signatures\u201d which are associated with the disease state and independent of temporal variation, (ii) the generation of \"\"predictive models of disease outcome\"\"- builds on previous work that pathways\/biomarkers for disease outcome are distinct from initial disease risk and may be shared across diseases to guide therapy decisions on an individual patient basis, (iii) \"\"reprogramming disease\"\"- will identify and target temporally stable epigenetic alterations in macrophages and lymphocytes in epigenome editing approaches as biological validation and potential novel therapeutic tool  .\nThus, SYSCID will foster the development of solid biomarkers and models as stratification in future long-term systems medicine clinical trials but also investigate new causative therapies by editing the epigenome code in specific immune cells, e.g.  to alleviate macrophage polarization defects.\"","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: Chromatin3D - Chromatin Dynamics in Development and Disease Abstract: The cell nucleus is organized and compartmentalized into a highly ordered structure that contains DNA, RNA, chromosomal and histone proteins which make up a structure called chromatin. The dynamics associated with these various components are responsible for regulating physiological processes and the overall stability of the genome. The destabilization of such regulatory mechanisms that act on the chromatin structure are implicated in pathologies such as cancer. Higher order organization of chromatin results in chromosomes which occupy discrete territories within the cell nucleus. Most nuclear processes occur or at least being initiated onto the chromosomes which makes them the main organizing factors in the nucleus. Several proteins that are involved in the replication of DNA, gene transcription and the processing of RNA are found enriched in discrete focal structures. An emerging question is how these structures assemble and are maintained in the absence of membranes and moreover what are the kinetics of stable binding and\/or rapid exchange of their components. The dynamic assembly and modification of chromatin during developmental processes as well as the deregulation of such chromatin dynamics during the onset of disease lacks mechanistic insights at present. To address these questions we have put forward a multidisciplinary approach which involves molecular, cellular and systems level approaches by assembling a group of scientists from academia and industry with cross disciplinary expertise and capabilities.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: MorSR - Integrating morpho-phonology in speech recognition Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is considered to represent the most natural man-machine interface across the spectrum of technological space. Current commercial ASR systems rely on a \u2018rich\u2019 representation of an acoustic signal for words and their variants, resulting in major challenges in the deployment of ASR systems in areas where it could have substantial social impact. Our central goal is to translate research results from the ERC funded project MORPHON into a novel ASR system to remove such barriers. We have previously demonstrated that the use of a universal set of phonological features delivers an isolated word recognition system (FlexSR) with enhanced phoneme recognition accuracy. It is more robust under conditions of non-standard speech, dialect variation and can be easily adapted to new languages. These aspects are problematic for current ASR systems which rely on the probabilistic sequencing of whole words in their language model (LM) based on large written text corpora for training. Obtaining sufficient training data for a new LM is prohibitively expensive. Instead, MorSR will incorporate linguistic information about word-structure to reject improbable words. This reduces the search space and increases the probability of identifying correct words. A major outcome will be an innovative LM based on linguistic principles. Unlike existing approaches, it is based on speech data to capture crucial regularities that are lost in text corpora. Combined with FlexSR's key strengths in identifying subtle phonological contrasts, MorSR will not only enable improved predictions of word sequences in running speech, but also dramatically reduce the requirement for training data when adapting the system to a new language. MorSR's strengths include: (a) prediction of fine-grained possibilities of word sequences based on grammatical principles; (b) requiring considerably less training data; (c) easily adaptable to new languages; and (d) will be fast, secure and accurate.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Indeed, while important steps have been taken in the past, the annual global extraction of materials tripled in the last 50 years and is expected to increase further. The dual transformation, green and digital, place special emphasis on resource and energy intensive sectors. Furthermore, the expected zero pollution action plan for air, water and soil will enforce this transformation. In this changing environment, industry will have to adapt swiftly and decisively but the ease and smoothness of this transition is up for debate. Solutions that increase costs and impede productivity will face substantial resistance. There is a pressing need for new technologies and approaches that complement economic growth and productivity while firstly addressing environmental challenges. iWAYS is a step in this direction, featuring a wide array of technologies that are non-disruptive and applicable in any industry with wastewater and gaseous emissions. While the concept of water and heat recovery have been demonstrated and widely applied, in iWAYS a unique approach is taken, focusing on until now impossible streams to address and building synergies between heat and water reclamation and exploitation.

{"text":"Title: BSSTD - Bioelectrochemical Sensing of Sexually Transmitted Diseases Abstract: The detection of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has become a serious medical concern around the globe, as the number of reported cases increases every year, particularly in the United Kingdom. Infection with STDs, such as Gonorrhea and Chlamydia can result in long term health issues, such as infertility, reproductive tract cancer, and poor perinatal outcome. The successful treatment of these diseases depends on a quick and reliable method of diagnosis, which will be the topic of this proposal. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a detection method for bacteria, associated with STDs, based on bioelectrochemical techniques.\nSpecific objectives of the proposed research consist of the identification of a redox couple functioning as electron donor for bacterial oxidases, the specific binding of bacteria to a macroelectrode, the electrochemical recognition of immobilized bacteria at the macroelectrode, testing for false-positive and false-negative results, the varying of target cultures to extend the scope of the proposed research, and finally, the assembly of a biosensing device using disposable screen printed electrodes.\nThe proposed technique will make use of a biochemical test for aerobic bacteria, the oxidase test, by adapting it for electrochemical detection. In doing so, high selectivity will be achieved by targeted binding of living bacteria to immobilized antibodies on an electrode, whereas sensitivity will be strongly increased through the localized electrochemical detection of the oxidase test product.

{"text":"Title: BoneMalar - Mechanisms of bone marrow sequestration during malaria infection Abstract: Malaria remains a major problem of public health in developing countries. It is responsible for about 600000 deaths per year, predominantly children in sub-Saharan Africa. There is an urgent need for novel therapies as resistance against current treatments is widespread. The complex parasite biology requires a multifaceted approach targeting multiple life cycle stages and virulence pathways. The pathogenesis of the most deadly of human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, is related to the capability of infected red blood cells to sequester in deep tissues. Sequestration is critical for the completion of the red blood cell cycle because the release of parasites into the blood circulation allows recognition by surveillance macrophages and clearance in the spleen. A series of studies have since led to the understanding that sequestration of asexually replicating parasites is caused by the adherence of parasite infected red blood cells to the vascular endothelium of various tissues in the body.\n We have recently demonstrated that gametocytes, the only stage capable of transmission to the mosquito vector, develop in the extravascular environment of the human bone marrow. Preliminary studies in the mouse model have confirmed this finding and also suggest existence of an asexual reservoir in the bone marrow. In this innovative multidiscipinary proposal we aim to investigate the host pathogen interactions at the interface between infected red blood cell and bone marrow vasculature. Specifically we will focus on the following questions: how do parasites home to bone marrow? What are the changes in the bone marrow endothelium upon infection? How do parasites adhere with and transmigrate across the vascular endothelium in the bone marrow? The proposed studies initiate detailed characterization of a new paradigm in malaria parasite interaction with the host vasculature and provide a compelling new avenue for intervention strategies.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: DESIGN-EID - Defect Simulation and Material Growth of III-V Nanostructures- European Industrial Doctorate Program Abstract: In semiconductor technology and applications today, we are increasingly observing a shift from the pure silicon CMOS technology towards hybridisation of function in terms of bringing in sensors, power, memory and photonics functionality on the same chip. In particular, there is a great interest in the heterogeneous and monolithic integration of III-V materials and other complex semiconductors, such as III-Nitrides and SiC on Si substrate. However, the direct growth of III-V materials on silicon inevitably will lead to crystal defects that significantly decreases performance of novel devices. \n\nTo overcome this main technological challenge and to make this new technology financially viable, the most cost-effective and time-effective approach is to combine experimental and simulation work, which indeed is the main aim on this project \u2013 DESING-EID. This will be achieved by addressing the following objectives. \n\nThe first objective of DESIGN-EID is to train three young ESRs who will bridge the gap between predictive simulations, experimental materials and device development by developing simulation tools for prediction of crystal growth as a function of process conditions. Secondly, completely eliminating defects in compound semiconductors is likely not achievable, therefore a simulation framework providing an accurate evaluation of their impact on device performance will be essential for designing devices and materials minimizing their impact. Furthermore, semiconductor defects in semiconductors may be exploited for their unique electronic properties if their presence and properties are controlled. For example, vacancies might be used to implement Qu-bits, whereas extended defects, such as dislocations, can provide unique transport properties. Hence, the last objective of the DESIGN-EID project focuses on experimental control and accurate simulation of the impact of defects on electronic and photonic device performance.","gt":false,"conf":0.6}

These contextual elements are presented in the project, providing an interpretation of the main research questions of the topic.: a) The de-carbonisation of coal and carbon intensive regions risks to be a cul de sac of the energy transition process. Along with this process a set of conflicts emerge and move from local to national and European level and vice-versa. One of the main ideas of the project is analysing these conflicts and the negotiation processes related to them, as well as the political cultures and discourses behind these conflicts; b) The challenges facing coal and carbon-intensive regions are studied in the light of the ongoing process at the territorial level. Another main idea of the project is to identifying the factors of de-territorialisation in action in different coal and carbon-intensive regions and to explain their dynamics and interactions; c) The clean energy transition cannot be understood only as a technological change or as an industrial shift, and it is studied as a socio-economic-psychological process affectng the life of local communities. In this respect the project is focused on the study of the coping strategies from a wide array of perspectives: A multidimensional perspective, combining different disciplinary frameworks; a comparative perspective, developing a comprehensive set of case studies; and a multilevel perspective, involving different key players at territorial, regional, national, European and global level.

No possible evidence can justify a metaphysical statement.\n2. If no possible evidence can justify a metaphysical statement then we can have no justification to believe a metaphysical statement.\nConclusion: We can have no justification to believe a metaphysical statement.\n\nThe deliverables will be six papers published in leading journals. The first will argue that critiques of metaphysics based on semantics do not succeed. The second will argue that epistemic criticisms of metaphysics are effective, specifically Carnap's. The third will defend premise 1, arguing that the rationalist renaissance of recent years has done little to undermine the relevant empiricist thesis. The fourth defends premise 2 as applied to the question of ontology (\u2018what exists?\u2019), arguing that the non-empirical considerations used by objective Bayesians can be applied to metaphysics. The fifth criticizes premise 2 as applied to the question of modality (\u2018what it necessary?\u2019), arguing that non-empirical considerations cannot help us determine the gap between the necessary and the contingent. The sixth develops the anti-realist theory of modality that follows, arguing that it makes best sense of the core intuitions of both sides of the argument.\nThese deliverables will expand the ER's core strengths into metaphysics, re-integrate him into Europe and establish him as one of the leading European experts in formal epistemology and the methodology of metaphysics.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Treatment of cirrhosis is currently based on symptomatic management of complications and has not changed substantially in the last 20 years. There is an unmet need for therapies that target the pathobiology of cirrhosis.\nThe objective of LIVERHOPE project is to evaluate a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with cirrhosis based on a combination of rifaximin and simvastatin, targeting the main pathophysiological mechanisms of disease progression , namely the impairment in the gut-liver axis and the persistent hepatic and systemic inflammatory response. This dual therapeutic approach is supported by preclinical data showing excellent and very promising results.\nWe will perform two randomized double-blind trials to investigate safety, tolerability and efficacy of combination of simvastatin plus rifaximin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis in 5 EU countries (285 patients will be enrolled in two trials in DE, ES, FR, IT, UK).

General circulation models still struggle to represent important features of the large-scale circulation in the present-day climate, which undermines confidence in future projections. \nThe present project is to combine a small-scale process-level with a large-scale dynamical perspective to investigate how drag processes at the Earth's surface associated with boundary-layer turbulence, orography and gravity waves affect large-scale circulation.

Such interactions are a key to the compartmentalization of a wide range of cellular mechanisms into discrete organelles, allowing to maintain homeostasis. In spite of implications to life sciences and drug discovery our current understanding of protein\u2013lipid interactions is limited. This is primarily due to the challenges imposed by existing methods for determining the fundamental interactions of a wide range of proteins and lipid bilayers due to the high level of heterogeneity of the formed complexes. Recent advances in the development of microfluidic techniques for characterisation of biomolecular complexes together with sensitive optical detection methods open new possibilities for fundamental studies of protein\u2013lipid interactions. The main objective of the proposed project is the development of a transformative microfluidic platforms dedicated for the study of interactions of lipid membranes with protein molecules. Experienced Researcher aims at the implementation of microfluidic technologies: micro free flow electrophoresis and nano deterministic lateral displacement, for the parallel development of two types of platforms. The development of the platform will be highlighted by addressing exemplary fundamental questions in molecular biology of interest that concern a wide range of aspects of mechanism of protein\u2013lipid interaction.

{"text":"Title: AutoProbe - Automated Probabilistic Black-Box Verification Abstract: One of the longstanding challenges in Computer Science has been the development of methods and tools providing rigorous guarantees about systems\u2019 behavior, performance, and security. There have been many successes in overcoming this challenge, notably the invention and widespread use of model checking. However, existing methods are impaired by the tension between the need of fast developing systems and the slowdown caused by the complexity of providing a model against which running systems can be verified.  Automata learning \u2013 automated discovery of automata models from system observations such as test logs \u2013 is emerging as a highly effective bug-finding technique with applications in verification of bank cards and basic network communication protocols. The design of algorithms for automata learning is a fundamental research problem and in the last years much progress has been made in developing and understanding of new algorithms (including the PI\u2019s own work). Yet, existing algorithms do not support crucial quantitative or concurrency aspects that are essential in modelling properties such as network congestion and fault-tolerance.  The central objective of this project is to develop a new verification framework that enables automated model- based verification for probabilistic and concurrent systems, motivated by applications in networks. We will provide active learning algorithms, in the style of Angluin\u2019s seminal L* algorithm, for automata models that were so far too complex to be tackled. We will base our development on rigorous semantic foundations, developed by the PI in recent years, which provide correctness for the algorithms in a modular way.  The project will significantly advance model-based verification in new and previously unexplored directions. This line of research will not only result in fundamental theoretical contributions and insights in their own right but will also impact the practice of concurrent and probabilistic network verification.","gt":false,"conf":0.6}
{"text":"Title: CAPaCITy - Designing Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalysis and Ion Transport Abstract: Solar energy conversion will play an essential role in the future supply of clean energy. Secure access to energy sources will require energy conversion technologies that are low impact, distributed and accessible both technically and financially. Molecular electronic materials embody these possibilities, offering facile synthesis, low energy production and the versatility to allow performance to be maximized for specific applications. Moreover, they bring appealing similarities with nature\u2019s intrinsically low impact energy conversion materials. Whilst molecular semiconductors have been studied in detail for solar-to-electric energy conversion they have seldom been studied for solar-to-chemical conversion or for charge storage. However, they bring exciting potential advantages in terms of their light harvesting properties, the range of microstructures possible and the ability to tune their electrical properties. Polymer materials applied to solar chemical generation could open up an innovative route to artificial fuels, with the option to control light harvesting and charge separation through structural control. Polymer materials applied to mixed (electronic \/ ionic) conduction provide a route to lower cost electrochemical storage, as well as to biocompatible devices and sensors. Stimulated by recent experimental breakthroughs in the application of polymers as photocatalysts and ion transport media I will exploit my expertise in multi-scale modelling and functional characterization of molecular electronic materials and devices to develop a design framework for energy conversion and storage in conjugated polymer materials. This proposal aims to disentangle the parameters that govern the performance of conjugated polymer based photocatalysts and ion transport media to discover the underlying functional mechanisms.

{"text":"Title: RELEVANCE - Regulation of red cell life-span, erythropoiesis, survival, senescence and clearance Abstract: Anaemia is the most common pathological condition affecting 1.6 billion individuals worldwide. It thus presents a serious health care problem and an economic burden. Reduction in red blood cell (RBC) number can be caused by blood loss, diet, stress conditions including endurance sport, and pathologies which are caused by primary genetic aberrations or are secondary to the malfunction of other cell types.  Transfusion of RBC, which is often the only cure for severe cases of anaemia, is associated with risks such as thrombosis and transfusion reactions due to allo-immunisation. There is an unmet need to improve treatment of anaemia through early and accurate diagnosis, targeted treatment, and increased safety and effectiveness of RBC transfusion. The aim of RELEVANCE is to improve fast and cost-effective diagnosis of the underlying cause of primary anaemia, and to improve treatment options for both general and personalised medicine. We defined five key objectives: (1) to improve diagnostics of anaemia, particularly for hereditary rare forms of anaemia (RA); (2) to find novel treatments for anaemia that target RBC production, ageing and clearance; (3) to reduce premature loss of RBC following transfusion; (4) to produce cultured RBC for transfusion; (5) to monitor and optimise RBC function during sport and exercise. RELEVANCE will train 15 early stage researchers (ESR) at four SMEs and eight academic partners, two of whom are at blood supply centres and two are diagnostic centres for RA. The continuous interactions between the clinic, blood supply centers, basic research, and industry will select for the most relevant unmet medical needs, and will stimulate innovative procedures that are immediately probed for applicability and validity both in a research and a clinical setting. RELEVANCE will organize three open access summer schools, extending training beyond the ESR of the ITN sustaining the critical number of young talented professionals in the field.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: p-TYPE - Transparent p-type semiconductors for efficient solar energy capture, conversion and storage. Abstract: This proposal will develop new transparent p-type semiconductors that will make dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) a vastly more efficient and a realistic prospect for carbon-free energy generation worldwide. Two key challenges will be addressed: (1) a means of converting NIR radiation to increase the amount of sunlight utilised from 35% to over 70%; (2) a means of storing the energy. Almost all the research in the field is based on dye or \u201cperovskite\u201d sensitized TiO2 (n-type) solar cells, which are limited by their poor spectral response in the red-NIR. pTYPE approaches the problem differently: tandem DSCs will be developed which combine a n-type and a p-type DSC in a single p\/n device. This increases the theoretical efficiency from 33% to 43% by extending the spectral response without sacrificing the voltage. The device will be modified with catalysts to convert H2O or CO2 and sunlight into fuel without using sacrificial reagents that limit the efficiency of current systems. An efficient tandem DSC has not yet been developed because p-type DSCs are much less efficient than n-type cells. As an independent Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin fellow I increased the photocurrent by developing new dyes. This project will exploit this breakthrough by increasing the voltage, which is currently limited by the NiO semiconductor conventionally used. I will rapidly synthesise libraries of alternative p-type semiconductors; select promising candidates based on key criteria which can be measured on a single sample within minutes: transparency and dye adsorption (for high light harvesting efficiency by the dye), conductivity (for high charge collection efficiency) and valence band potential (for high voltage); assemble the new materials in tandem DSCs. As one of the few researchers experienced in preparing, characterising and optimising each aspect of this photoelectrochemical system, I aim to match the efficiency from TiO2 with p-type DSCs to obtain tandem efficiencies above 20%.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

This will be achieved, without distracting users from safe driving, through a multidisciplinary approach aiming at the development of a user friendly, unobtrusive multi-player gaming environment, where the users will not only play collaboratively\/competitively using their mobile device but also using the car itself and their own bodies, thus turning eco-driving into an immersive and highly motivating experience. The sensing infrastructure of GamECAR will not only acquire data related to driving from an OBD sensor that will capture a complex set of parameters related to eco-driving, but will also sense environmental and physiological parameters of the driver, so as to better position the state of the system (car) in context (environment, user). The use of virtual user models and cognitive modeling of the users, will further boost personalization and adaptation of the game itself with respect to the needs of the individual driver.\nThe GamECAR system will be quantified and evaluated in test campaigns with drivers in three different sites. Quantification campaigns serve system development and evaluation campaigns demonstrate usefulness and exploitation potential. Finally, the project has a clear exploitation plan through a balanced and highly complementary composition of SMEs that have specific roles in the development of the integrated GamECAR system.\nThe impact of such a holistic and innovative approach is huge and the foundations laid here are expected to result in a widespread adoption of sensor-based gamification platforms in areas going far beyond eco-driving.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

Current norms on valuation, such as RICS', recognise Energy Effiency (EE) as a potential source of value, but do not require taking this into account in appraisals, nor provide clear guidance on how to do so. As a result, investors are not provided with the formal basis to invest in or to provide financing (eg through mortgages) for EE components\n\nFor a standard renovation of a residential unit, up to 10k Euro in EE could be made ' bankable'  if valuation norms and standards would better reflect long term EE value. At EU level, this could potentially unlock 20Bn Euro per year in financing of EE measures. Since 26% of EUs energy is consumed in homes, increasing investment on EE could significantly contribute to H2020 targets\n\nSpecific ReValue objectives are:\n1 develop and propose a set of norms and policies in the valuation of residential property that recognise EE\n2 align valuation techniques with such norms\n3 validate the framework in 4 pilot projects across Europe\n4 Stimulate uptake of the framework through widely recognised norms and support from key industry stakeholders\n\nReValue's consortium is industry-lead, including RICS, one of the globally recognised standardisation bodies, and Savills, a leading valuer, and academic and professional experts in accounting, economics and EE design.

{"text":"Title: StressEBOV - Ebola virus manipulation of the cellular stress responses Abstract: Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly pathogenic filovirus that causes severe haemorraghic fever and killed over 11,000 people during the recent epidemic in Western Africa. Although potential vaccines and drugs are being tested, no treatment has been approved. Therefore, understanding the cellular regulation of EBOV replication is fundamental to develop novel treatments. \nEBOV is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus for which research is limited to BSL4 laboratories. However, a recent reverse genetic system using tetracistronic transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) allows modelling of the entire EBOV life cycle under BSL2 conditions. \nThe EBOV genome is transcribed and replicated by the viral polymerase complex but the regulation of these processes remains poorly characterised. EBOV RNAs can also trigger antiviral responses via cytoplasmic RNA-sensors RIG-I and PKR, the latter also promoting stress granule (SG) formation. While EBOV inhibits RNA-sensing, the impact of SGs on EBOV is unknown. \nTherefore, I will investigate the role of cellular stress responses on EBOV replication and their potential counteraction by the EBOV VP35 protein using the trVLP system. Firstly, I will analyse the impact of SGs on EBOV replication by overexpression and CRISPR\/Cas9 depletion of SG proteins. Using a panel of VP35 mutants, I will also investigate its potential to counteract SGs by automated flow cytometric image acquisition (Imagestream). Secondly, I will identify the EBOV polymerase complex interactome during infection using two distinct proteomic approaches: co-purification with a VP35-GFP fusion protein(GFP-trap) and VP35biotin-ligase proximity tagging (BioID2). Candidate VP35 cofactors will be validated by biochemical interaction, CRISPR-knockout and live cell microscopy to determine their role in EBOV replication. In summary, this project will increase the understanding of EBOV replication and identify new therapeutic targets.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

Direct heat exchangers (e.g. geothermal brine to district heating) and ORC HXs such as superheater, preheater, evaporator are in direct contact with the geothermal brine, causing scaling and corrosion at different extent based on the thermophysical condition and chemical composition of the geofluid. To handle corrosion, expensive materials are recommended, but due to lower thermal conductivity and degraded performance over time compel to increases the size of the HXs. Hence, improvements in the antiscaling and anticorrosion properties as well as heat transfer performance of the HX material will lead to smaller, more efficient and less costly systems.\n\nGeoHex will rely on the use low cost carbon steel as base material for HX. Through modifying the surface with nano porous coating and controlling the surface chemistry (along with the surface structure), GeoHex will significantly improve the heat transfer performance of single phase and phase change heat transfer process respectively. To attribute the antiscaling and anticorrosion properties, the brine side of the surface will be Ni-P\/Ni-P-PTFE duplex coated by electroless method.\n\nGeoHex will significantly reduce the cost of ORC plant while lowering the environmental impact.

Widely regarded as a death sentence, the 5-year survival rate is only 3% in the UK and this figure has not changed over the past four decades due to lack of specific therapies and inability to detect it early. Several years often elapses from the beginning of the disease to the patient\u2019s diagnosis, suggesting a window of opportunity for early detection. Recently, tiny nanometre-sized vesicles (exosomes) shed by the tumour in the bloodstream, have emerged as powerful circulating biomarkers possessing extremely high sensitivity and specificity, thus paving the way for a new era of non-invasive cancer diagnostics. However, currently the process of exosome isolation and detection is not only highly inefficient, but also technically challenging and inaccessible to hospital laboratories, clinical facilities and resource-poor settings. \nTo address technological constraints of exosome utilisation, we are developing a microfluidic device that leverages cutting-edge microfabrication technology to enable isolation and detection of tumour exosomes from the blood for screening and detecting early-stage pancreatic cancer with unprecedented precision. This chip will have two components, a separation module where exosomes will be isolated from all other blood particles, and a detection chamber that will incorporate technology to achieve ultralow resolution.  The first stage of development will be concerned with the fabrication of all components necessary to harness the sensitivity of the exosome biomarker.

One of the most important conjectures within Model Theory is Zilber's Trichotomy Conjecture, which suggested a classification of so-called strongly minimal structures - the building bricks of large classes of first order structures. Even though having been refuted quickly after its formulation, this conjecture and its counter example by Hrushovski have shaped the research in model theory and ultimately led Hrushovski to his outstanding proofs of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture, originating in the area of Number Theory. \n\nThe notion of AMPLENESS was developed in order to classify the geometries left out in the Trichotomy Conjecture. Even though studied by many after its introduction, there is a plethora of open questions around this notion, witnessing that a thorough understanding is still missing. Answers to these questions have the potential to reshape the view on the classification of first order structures. The ER managed in her PhD thesis to solve one of the main open problems in this area, by combining tools from the field of TITS BUILDINGS, which was developed to classify simple algebraic groups and groups of Lie type. \n\nTogether with the project Supervisor, who is a leading expert in the area of ampleness, the ER will establish a full understanding of the notion of ampleness, using its close connections to the theory of Tits Buildings.

To extract the significant amounts of valuable compounds contained in these wastes, AgriMax will combine affordable and flexible processing technologies (ultrasound assisted and solvent extraction, filtration, thermal and enzymatic treatments) for the valorization of side streams from the horticultural culture and food processing industry to be used in a cooperative approach by local stakeholders.\nThrough the selection of case-scenarios previously developed to a pilot scale by the participating RTOs and their industrial transfer in new applications as food additives, packaging and agricultural materials among others, the project will disclose the holistic potential of four new agro-value chains (residues and by products from the culture and processing of tomato, cereals, olives, potato). Any by-product generated along the production cycle will be valorized in a cascade manner to reach over 40% of high value use of the waste. This will lead to additional production of active ingredients in lower concentration, but also fibres, biogas and fertilizers from the left biomass (the latter with the aim of being used in closed loop in the culture of the crops used in the project to prevent soil impoverishing). An LCA and LCC will also study the best approach to minimize the environmental impact of the new value chains without jeopardizing the cost effectiveness of the operations. The pilot multi-feedstock bio-refinery processes will be validated in two demonstration sites in Spain and Italy. Societal, ethical, safety, techno-feasibility and regulatory aspects will be studied. Last but not least, a business model and platform for communication between the potential raw materials suppliers will be set up to maximize the use of the cooperative treatment plants throughout the year.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

{"text":"Title: WISDOM - The autonomous floral pathway: a WIndow to Study the tight link between non-coDing RNA and chrOMatin regulation Abstract: My Fellowship will explore the interconnection between non-coding RNA and chromatin regulation. Building on a detailed mechanistic base, I will capitalize on the recent proteomic identification of a stable complex FLD\/SDG26 by my host lab, which plays a central role in the co-transcriptional silencing of the Arabidopsis floral repressor locus FLC. This protein complex is central to a mechanism determining the quantitative expression level of FLC, and thus the reproductive strategy of the plant. However, these activities also regulate many other targets in the Arabidopsis genome and the conserved nature of the components suggests the deeper understanding gained from this study will be important generally across all eukaryotes. FLD is a histone demethylase with specificity for H3K4; SDG26 is a SET domain protein likely to methylate histones and other proteins, but whose specificity is currently unknown. The splicing and alternative processing of FLC antisense non-coding transcript, COOLAIR, is essential for the repression of FLC transcription. However, how the processing of COOLAIR controls sense transcription remains elusive. My proposal aims to: 1) test the hypothesis that the FLD\/SDG26 complex, triggered by FCA\/FY-mediated proximal polyadenylation of COOLAIR, delivers a specific chromatin environment, which represses transcriptional output: and 2) explore the missing link between FCA\/FY-mediated proximal polyadenylation of COOLAIR and chromatin regulation by FLD\/SDG26 complex. My proposal involves interconnections between genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology, enabling me to develop a broader experimental skillset. It directly contributes to the action\u2019s goals to: improve my creative potential and competences through international mobility and advanced training in technical and transferable skills; enhance collaborative and contact networks for both myself and my host lab through academic and public engagement; and drive substantial career development.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

This long awaited discovery increased our understanding of the world, providing an explanation for the mechanism from which all elementary particles acquire mass. However, there are still fundamental questions awaiting a clear answer: which model better describes nature when all observed properties of this new particle are taken into consideration? Will these new models help to solve other outstanding problems in elementary particle physics? The goal of this project is to look for answers to these crucial questions regarding our understanding of nature.\nIn order to address the problem we have gathered a group of people with complementary expertises that range from model builders to high-energy tool developers who will finally make the connection to the LHC's experimental collaborations. We expect that this interaction between the different nodes of this international collaboration will result in a database together with high-energy tools where a number of models will be readily available for testing by the experimental groups at the LHC and future colliders.\nThe staff exchange will be planned according to the needs of the project. There have been collaborations in the past between some of the nodes. We now expect that the proposed staff exchange will enhance this Higgs physics network, with an effective skills development both for experienced and early stage researchers.

The newly implemented technology is a ground-breaking innovation providing up to four times increased lifetime with greatly increased efficiency, the energy consumption reduced by 80%. Thus, this technology provides a lower carbon footprint, much improved energy use and hence greatly reduced lifetime costs. Additionally, the innovative technology will be introduced with a mercury-free configuration, removing the need to handle with this hazardous substance in manufacture and disposal, hence providing a sustainable and eco-innovative technology. The project will prove the lamp technology by demonstration in real applications with full characterisation in terms of long-term stability, ageing effects and dose-response-relationship. Furthermore, the UV lamps are integrated in reactors and the performance of the whole UV system is evaluated at a test centre for drinking water. A new testing protocol for different end-users applications will furthermore be derived, which will be the basis for a future standardised validation of industrial UV applications. The technology will be installed at three demonstration sites for an extended running period. At each, the treatment performance of the UV systems will be evaluated according to the inactivation of micro organisms and the reduction of application specific chemicals, e. g. antibiotics and pesticides.

{"text":"Title: ImagePlanetFormDiscs - Imaging the Dynamical Imprints of Planet Formation in Protoplanetary Discs Abstract: The gas and dust discs around young stars are thought to be the birthplace of planetary systems and are a key area to study if further progress is to be made on understanding the history of our solar system and our own origins. Once planets have formed in these discs, they dynamically sculpt their environment, for instance by opening tidally-cleared gaps or triggering spiral arms and disc warps. The late stages of this process are likely observed in the \u201ctransitional\u201d discs, where regions spanning tens of astronomical units (AU) have been cleared. The aim of this project is to image the planet formation signatures both during the transitional disc and the earlier T Tauri or Herbig Ae\/Be stars phase, where the protoplanetary bodies are just starting to carve gaps in the optically thick disc. For this purpose, we will employ the latest generation of near-infrared, mid-infrared, and sub-millimeter interferometric instruments that will allow us to trace a wide range of stellocentric radii, disc scale heights, and dust opacities. We will make use of recent revolutionary advancements in infrared detector technology and equip the CHARA\/MIRC 6-telescope beam combiner with a low-read noise camera that will significantly increase the sensitivity of this instrument and enable us to image protoplanetary discs with 2.5 times higher resolution and much higher efficiency than ever before. These quick-look imaging capabilities will enable us to trace time-variable structures in the inner few AU and to investigate their relation to the commonly observed photometric and spectroscopic variability. Our interferometric observations in spectral lines aim to detect the accretion signatures of the young protoplanets themselves.

{"text":"Title: EXO-EYE - Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes for the treatment of Traumatic and Degenerative Eye Disease Abstract: The death and dysfunction of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) is a major cause of blindness in traumatic and degenerative ocular disease. For example, 60M people are affected by glaucoma with 4.5M becoming blind in both eyes, whilst optic neuritis affects 5\/100,000 people and represents a significant problem for sufferers. RGC are the sole projection neurons and their axons make up the optic nerve, making them exquisitely sensitive to injury. As CNS neurons are irreplaceable, neuroprotective strategies are paramount to therapies aimed at preserving vision but as of yet, no such therapy exists. Current research has demonstrated significant neuroprotection by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) including those from the bone marrow (BMSC), acting not as replacements for RGC but rather, as paracrine-mediated support cells. Clinical trials are already ongoing to test their efficacy in patients. Despite this, the exact mechanism behind their neuroprotective potential is not well understood. Recent studies have shown that exosomes, extracellular vesicles containing proteins, mRNA and miRNA may mediate much of the paracrine support offered by MSC and thus act as an easily purifiable cell-free alternative therapy for RGC neuroprotection. This proposal aims to assess the therapeutic efficacy of BMSC-derived exosomes, their characterisation and that of their RNA cargo. We will test these exosomes in animal models of traumatic (optic nerve crush) and degenerative (glaucoma) eye disease. Specifically, this proposal employs a novel strategy to promote RGC survival (relevant to ONC and glaucoma) and axon regeneration (relevant to optic nerve crush) through the use of exosomal delivery of mRNA\/miRNA into injured RGC utilizing in vitro and in vivo injury models, RNAseq and CRISPR technology.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: PhyMeBa - The Physical  Mechanics of Swimming Bacteria Abstract: Bacteria play a critical role in the life of higher organisms. Their behavior is constrained by the physical properties of their habitat: first and foremost, the presence of a surrounding fluid. Most bacteria are motile, and most motile bacteria swim in fluids using slender helical appendages called flagella rotated by specialized motors. While many bacteria have only one flagellum, most well-studied pathogenic bacteria possess multiple flagella. Why have some bacteria evolved to use many flagella when others survive with one? In order to answer this question, one needs to understand quantitatively how multiple flagella provide a fitness advantage to a cell exploring its environment. The principal difficulty in deriving rigorous models for swimming bacteria lies in the {nonlinear} nature of the underlying external physics, which involves nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between flagella, short-range steric and electrostatic interactions, and elastic deformations of the flagella, which not only bend and twist but also undergo conformational changes. In this project, we will develop novel experimentally-testable theoretical modeling of the configurations and regimes relevant to swimming bacteria with multiple flagella with a focus on the mechanical forces at play. As a fundamental departure with past work, we will seek to exploit the slenderness and relative proximity of the flagella to incorporate all nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between flagella analytically and to simplify the determination of elastic stresses. This will allow us, in turn, to determine precisely the distribution of flagellar forces and derive a predictive framework for the stochastic behavior of swimming cells. The project will provide first-principle understanding of the external forces at play in one of the most important processes in biology and will help answer a number of outstanding physical questions on the behavior of swimming bacteria and the interactions with their environment.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

A drug that modulates macrophage function, suppressing the pro-inflammatory response while maintaining pro-repair function would represent a major breakthrough in the treatment of multiple degenerative diseases.\nOur host group very recently identified a biased agonist of an immunometabolic receptor, GPR84, which failed to induce chemotaxis (pro-inflammatory response) while stimulating phagocytosis (pro-repair response) in both murine and human macrophage (ACS Chem.

Abstract: Light-addressable potentiometric sensors (LAPS) have great potential as a tool for functional electrochemical imaging of the attachment area of cells, providing information such as ion concentration, extracellular potentials and ion channel activity. The technique is particularly attractive for analysing cell responses of cells with planar polarisation as the cell-surface attachment area is not accessible to conventional electrophysiological measurements. However, current systems suffer either from poor resolution or slow scanning speed. In this project, we propose to develop a novel LAPS setup with high spatiotemporal resolution combined with two-photon fluorescence microscopy that allows imaging of physiological processes with submicron resolution and in real time. Novel zinc sensitive surfaces will be developed and used in conjunction with the new high-resolution and high-speed LAPS setup to investigate the role of zinc in age related macular degeneration (AMD). The retina and the underlying retinal pigment epithelium contain high concentrations of zinc. Several eye disorders are associated with altered zinc balance, and zinc supplementation has become a choice of treatment for diseases like agerelated macular degeneration. Despite its importance in health and diseases of the eye, it is still not well understood how zinc participates in cellular and molecular events and how zinc supplementation might be beneficial. We will investigate zinc fluxes at the basal side of the retinal pigment epithelium where zinc is suspected to play a key role in the formation of deposits and the initiation of AMD. The results of the study may lead to new treatments to prevent, forestall, or reverse the effects of the disease and may also help to elucidate zinc's role in other diseases including type 2 diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and Alzheimer disease and are therefore expected to impact the pharmaceutical industry and increase the quality of life for an ageing population.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}

The SuperEMFL design study aims to add through the development of the HTS technology an entirely new dimension to the EMFL that go beyond the commercial offer, providing the European high field user community with much higher SC fields and novel SC magnet geometries, like large-bore-high-flux magnets or radial access magnets.\nThe development of SC magnets that can partly replace current high-field resistive magnets will result in a significant reduction of the energy consumption of the static field EMFL facilities. This will strongly improve EMFL\u2019s financial and ecological sustainability and at the same time boost its scientific performance and impact.\n The high field values, the very low noise and vibration levels, and the possibility to run very long duration experiments will make high SC magnetic fields attractive to scientific communities that so far have rarely used the EMFL facilities (NMR, scanning probe, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, ultra-low temperature physics,  electro-chemistry \u2026). \nAll these new research possibilities will strengthen the scientific performance, efficiency and attractiveness of the EMFL and thereby of the European Research Area (ERA).

{"text":"Title: TASAB - TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE ALGAL BIOREFINERY Abstract: Algal-based biofuels are increasingly attracting attention as they have the capacity to serve both as a source of renewable carbon fuels and as a powerful tool for carbon sequestration. However, algal biofuel production remains outside the realm of economic feasibility due to the energy-intensive extraction techniques and limitations in algal cultivation which requires large amounts of fertilizer. Existing commercial algal biomass production technologies are prohibitively expensive for fuel generation which represents a commercial constraint to developing competitive European algal biofuel companies. The proposed Fellowship \u2013 TASAB - is a novel algal biorefinery concept, offering an environmentally-sustainable closed system integrating both thermal and biochemical conversion pathways. This concept will be able to maximize energy production from algae for achieving a net positive energy balance and to almost fully recycle nutrients to support algal large scale production and reduce the economic and environmental impacts associated with synthetic fertilizer use.

{"text":"Title: BIONICO - BIOgas membrane reformer for deceNtralIzed hydrogen produCtiOn Abstract: BIONICO will develop, build and demonstrate at a real biogas plant (TRL6) a novel reactor concept integrating H2 production and separation in a single vessel. The hydrogen production capacity will be of 100 kg\/day.\nBy using the novel intensified reactor, direct conversion of biogas to pure hydrogen is achieved in a single step, which results in an increase of the overall efficiency and strong decrease of volumes and auxiliary heat management units. The BIONICO process will demonstrate to achieve an overall efficiency up to 72% thanks to the process intensification. \nIn particular, by integrating the separation of hydrogen in situ during the reforming reaction, the methane in the biogas will be converted to hydrogen at a much lower temperature compared with a conventional system, due to the shifting effect on the equilibrium conversion.\nThe fluidization of the catalyst makes also possible to (i) overcome problems with temperature control (formation of hotspots or too low temperature), (ii) to operate with smaller particles while still maintaining very low pressure drops and (iii) to overcome any concentration polarization issue associated with more conventional fixed bed membrane reactors. Dedicated tests with different biogas composition will be carried out to show the flexibility of the process with respect to the feedstock type.\nCompared with any other membrane reactor project in the past, BIONICO will demonstrate the membrane reactor at a much larger scale, so that more than 100 membranes will be implemented in a single fluidized bed membrane reactor, making BIONICO\u2019s\nIn this way a more easy operation can be carried out so that a stable pure hydrogen production can be achieved. BIONICO project is based upon knowledge and experience directly gained in three granted projects: ReforCELL, FERRET and FluidCELL.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: HiFi-ELEMENTS - High Fidelity Electric Modelling and Testing Abstract: Within the automotive product development cycle virtual and heterogeneous testing is becoming increasingly established through component, module and vehicle-level simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop test-beds\u2014enabled by ever increasing computing power and communications bandwidth available.\nThough a number of standards in this field have been established (FMI, ASAM XiL API), models are still mostly created in a fragmented manner: using domain-specific tools to create, manage and execute simulations; no standardisation of the content of the functional interfaces (FMI does standardise the format); limited scalability. This fragmentation leads to a lot of redundant effort as models of the same component or system are re-created several times.\nHiFi-ELEMENTS will address this fragmentation through two main mechanisms: Firstly, we will develop, validate and publish a recommendation for standardisation of model interfaces for common e-drive components (e-machine, inverter, battery, DC\/DC converter, thermal management system), and will implement compliant versions of existing models. Secondly, we will implement a seamless workflow linking extended versions of existing tools\u2014a model\/data management tool and a co-simulation tool for MiL and HiL environments\u2014augmented with effort-saving automated methods for model parameterisation and test case generation.\n Validation of standardised models and workflow will be done in 4 industrially relevant use cases depicting 4 common scenarios in e-drivetrain and EV development. On project conclusion, the interface recommendations and workflow methods will be disseminated in order to gain widespread EV-industry adoption. Consortium partners are very intensive users of virtual testing and will directly use the project results, while tool vendor partners will exploit the results by bringing extended software tools to market.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}

{"text":"Title: MYCONEUTROPHILS - Elucidating the involvement of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis using a zebrafish model Abstract: Tuberculosis has afflicted humans for about 70,000 years and continues to take a huge toll on human health. The increase of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the limited effectiveness of the existing treatments make urgent a deeper understanding of its immunopathogenesis. The role of macrophages in the disease has been intensively studied, but little is known about the involvement of neutrophils. Recent findings indicate that neutrophils play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis that are unknown until the present. Thus, in this project I will use the recognized zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model, available in the host lab, to study the role played by neutrophils in mycobacterial infection. I propose to use this infection model combined with in vivo imaging of the interactions host-pathogen, gain and loss of gene function strategies, the use of zebrafish transgenic and mutant lines, gene expression analysis, and multitude of other techniques available in the host lab to study (1) how mycobacteria can evade neutrophil recruitment and phagocytosis, (2) what is the origin of the two functionally different neutrophil populations observed in mycobacterial infection, (3) how neutrophils can kill mycobacteria in the absence of macrophages and without any physical interaction, and (4) why neutrophils act as macrophage scavengers. The elucidation of all these questions never studied before will allow me to shed light on the involvement of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, and will represent a relevant improvement in the field with biomedical implications. Moreover, it will be a crucial step in my scientific career thinking of becoming a group leader in the field of immunology and infectious diseases, since I will have the opportunity to work in a relevant biomedical question, with the support of the main experts in the field, in an unsurpassable scientific environment, and with the best facilities.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: Mag-ID - Magnetic identification Abstract: The project consortium consisting of BOGEN (project coordinator, SME), INESC-MN (research), and INSPECTRON (SME) will bring the novel identification solution for track & trace, anti-counterfeiting and product verification to market. INSPECTRON has recently developed a magnetic ink barcode reader and has implemented this in a mailer project. BOGEN has developed with INESC-MN a new technology to read magnetic ink with TMR sensing technology. Combining these approaches results in a disruption for the identification and authentication\/anti-counterfeiting markets with Mag-ID, the magnetic readable barcode based on ink. The objective of this action is to introduce Mag-ID as a cost-efficient alternative for high volume tracking & tracing, brand protection and inspection and to replace passive RFID as a cheap solution for high volume applications. Since magnetic barcodes are dirt resistant, the technology will replace some barcodes with a more reliable read. The technology allows for distance reading, which means that the information can be read through coatings, e.g. parts before and after a paint booth can be identified automatically with the same technology. This can be used for tracking and tracing of components in a subassembly e.g. in identification documents to ensure that personal data and pictures are matched in the process and after assembly. Together with a verification as a service platform, SMEs can provide authentication and validation services world-wide. Magnetic barcodes can replace many RFID solutions as they are environment-friendly without separate electronic device disposal. Within Mag-ID, the SME partners will demonstrate the results manifold: BOGEN Mag-ID one-shot reader in a volume application, INSPECTRON with evaluation modules for the Mag-ID brand protection, tracking and inspection solutions. INSPECTRON will move into a service-based business model, while BOGEN will create a separate business for a project-based model.","gt":false,"conf":0.6}
{"text":"Title: PRECIOUS - Scaling-up biodegradable nanomedicines for multimodal for multimodal precision cancer immunotherapy Abstract: PRECIOUS aims at scaling-up biodegradable nanomedicines for multimodal precision cancer immunotherapy.\nWith 3.5 million cancer patients in Europe every year, new cancer medicines are eagerly awaited, notably for prostate and ovarian cancer.\nSystemically applied new immunotherapies are promising, but their toxicity is a hurdle. Vaccination against cancer is safe but rather the efficacy can be disappointing, i.e. the microenvironment shuts down anti-tumour immunity.\n\nPRECIOUS will tackle 2 bottlenecks:\n1.\tProduction of non toxic multimodal nanomedicines, which induce vigorous immune responses, and at the same time reverse immunosuppression\n2.\tLarge scale GMP production of nanomedicines, and initiate a multimodal immunotherapy Phase I trial. \n\nWe want to solve these bottlenecks by:\nObjective 1: Two types of GMP biodegradable nanoparticles: 1) a nanovaccine, containing tumour antigens and immune activators, and 2) a nanoparticle composed of compounds, which reverses the suppression and reactivates immunity in the tumour.\nObjective 2: Clinical Phase I trial to show efficacy. Nanomedicines will be used by 1) injection of vaccines to evoke immune responses and 2) injection of nanoparticles in the tumour microenvironment, which slowly release compounds that reverse suppression.\n\nTo achieve this, a platform is formed with 6 leading industrial partners to produce large scale GMP nanomedicines and an excellent immunomodulator track record, together with 5 renowned academic partners to perform clinical studies. \nRelevance to call: Large scale GMP production, industrial leadership, nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing KET technologies, translation to the clinic, marketing development.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: LIQUISWITCH - External Control of Liquid Nanofilms for Switchable Friction and Adhesion Abstract: The overall vision of the project is to demonstrate methods for switching friction and adhesion \u2013 such as \u201cswitch off friction\u201d or \u201cswitch on adhesion\u201d \u2013 reversibly and with remote control. My hypothesis is that fluids confined to nanofilms between solid objects can be designed to dramatically alter their surface properties under the influence of applied fields, and so can be used to switch friction, lubrication or adhesion in a controlled and reversible way. The emphasis of the project is on creating well-defined model experiments, with high resolution in both film thickness and interaction forces, in order to reach a fundamental understanding of the new concepts and mechanisms involved. The novelty lies in both the newly-proposed mechanisms of switching friction and adhesion interactions, and the new instrumentation constructed to detect and analyse the forces. The new methodologies necessary for these pioneering experiments involve two new versions of a Surface Force Balance (SFB) providing molecular-resolution (0.1nm) control and measurement of interfacial liquid films, controlled application of electric and magnetic fields, and ultra-sensitive measurement of friction and adhesion. Notably, one of these new instruments will have macroscopic graphene electrodes for confinement of liquid nanofilms (0 \u2013 100nm) between atomically smooth electrodes. The wide range of \u2018switchable\u2019 liquids studied will include polyelectrolytes, magnetic fluids, ionic liquids and self-assembled systems. Ultimately, this project will change the way we think about surface interactions into something we can \u2018switch and control\u2019.","gt":false,"conf":0.2}
{"text":"Title: Keep Control - Industrial Academic Initial Training Network towards specific diagnosis and treatment of age-related gait and balance deficits Abstract: Balance and gait deficits are ubiquitous among the older population, and lead to enormous personal, occupational and health care burden. Emerging pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to date have only small to moderate effects on these deficits. This is likely due to remaining fundamental questions on underlying mechanisms and treatment. The present project Keep Control consists of a rare EU-wide combination of experts from clinical, biomechanic and neuroscience research, along with experts from the industry, who all aim at gaining a better understanding and treatment of balance and gait deficits in older adults. We aim to scrutinize aspects such as: (1) comparability of balance and gait assessment in the clinic and the home environment, (2) gait and balance deficits as prodromal markers of neurodegeneration, and as markers to differentiate between Parkinsonian syndromes, (3) association between freezing of gait and balance, and (iv) gait and balance deficits in patients with sarcopenia. Tools such as sophisticated lab-based gait and balance assessment devices, perturbation treadmill, wearable devices, electrophysiology and blood and tissue investigations will be implemented. We will further employ promising therapeutic strategies for specific gait and balance deficits in older adults, including both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies. An entire work package will be dedicated to a novel harmonization and integration approach across the whole network: It will (i) harmonize assessment protocols based on the WHO definition of health and disability, to pave the way for an exhaustive meta-analysis of all data collected, and (ii) foster the active involvement of all study participants by implementation of a participant-controlled medical record. In summary, Keep control will cover the entire range of expertise necessary and utilize cutting edge technology to educate fellows in the area of gait and balance deficits in older adults.","gt":false,"conf":0.0}
{"text":"Title: DICE - Developing Data-Intensive Cloud Applications with Iterative Quality Enhancements Abstract: The rapid increase in demand for data-intensive applications capable of exploiting Big Data technologies such as Hadoop\/MapReduce, NoSQL, cloud-based storage, and stream processing is creating massive growth opportunities for European independent software vendors (ISVs). However, developing software that meets the high-quality standards expected for business-critical cloud applications remains a barrier to this market for many small and medium ISVs, which often lack resources and expertise for advanced quality engineering.\n\nDICE will tackle this challenge by defining a quality-driven development methodology and related tools that will markedly accelerate the development of business-critical data-intensive applications running on public or private clouds. Building on the principles of model-driven development (MDD) and on popular standards such as UML, MARTE and TOSCA, the project will first define a novel MDD methodology that can describe data and data-intensive technologies in cloud applications. A quality engineering toolchain offering simulation, verification, and numerical optimisation will leverage these extensions to drive the early design stages of the application development and guide software quality evolution.\n\nDevOps-inspired methods for deployment, testing, continuous integration and monitoring feedback analysis will be used to accelerate the incorporation of quality in data-intensive cloud application both in public and private deployments, enhancing the capability of small and medium European ISVs to enter the Big Data market.","gt":false,"conf":0.6}
