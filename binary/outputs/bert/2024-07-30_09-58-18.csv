"Title: HiFi-ELEMENTS - High Fidelity Electric Modelling and Testing Abstract: Within the automotive product development cycle virtual and heterogeneous testing is becoming increasingly established through component, module and vehicle-level simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop test-beds—enabled by ever increasing computing power and communications bandwidth available.
Though a number of standards in this field have been established (FMI, ASAM XiL API), models are still mostly created in a fragmented manner: using domain-specific tools to create, manage and execute simulations; no standardisation of the content of the functional interfaces (FMI does standardise the format); limited scalability. This fragmentation leads to a lot of redundant effort as models of the same component or system are re-created several times.
HiFi-ELEMENTS will address this fragmentation through two main mechanisms: Firstly, we will develop, validate and publish a recommendation for standardisation of model interfaces for common e-drive components (e-machine, inverter, battery, DC/DC converter, thermal management system), and will implement compliant versions of existing models. Secondly, we will implement a seamless workflow linking extended versions of existing tools—a model/data management tool and a co-simulation tool for MiL and HiL environments—augmented with effort-saving automated methods for model parameterisation and test case generation.
 Validation of standardised models and workflow will be done in 4 industrially relevant use cases depicting 4 common scenarios in e-drivetrain and EV development. On project conclusion, the interface recommendations and workflow methods will be disseminated in order to gain widespread EV-industry adoption. Consortium partners are very intensive users of virtual testing and will directly use the project results, while tool vendor partners will exploit the results by bringing extended software tools to market.",1
"Title: PreventIT - Early risk detection and prevention in ageing people by self-administered ICT-supported assessment and a behavioural change intervention delivered by use of smartphones and smartwatches Abstract: Lifestyle, disease and biology put older people at risk of functional decline, leading to falls, cognitive impairment, frailty, and negative consequences for quality of life. PreventIT will develop and test an ICT based mHealth System (iPAS) for the consumer market that 1) enables early identification of risk of age-related functional decline, and 2) engenders behavioural change in younger older adults in order to adopt a healthy, active lifestyle. We will use an integrated system of a smartphone/watch as frontend technology and a protected cloud-based solution for handling of personal data as backend technology. We will develop online instruments for risk-screening, complexity metrics, motivation for behavioural change, and a method for personalise exercise by phenotype, based on currently available big data sets. The ICT based intervention we develop is unique, delivered on a smartphone/watch with exercise integrated in daily life and a behaviour change programme. We will evaluate the role of technology and behavioural change theories in risk prevention by performing a multinational feasibility RCT to compare with the same intervention without use of technology and with practice as usual. Usability and feasibility will be in focus, and ageing people will be included in all phases of the project. At the end of the project all assessment and intervention components will be integrated into a personalised self-administered activity system, designed to empower ageing people to control their own health and function. A microsimulation health economics model will be developed to predict effects of our risk prevention intervention on carers and the health care system. PreventIT will be performed by a strong interdisciplinary team with previous impact in the field of ageing and ICT, and commercial partners who are strong on technology development and exploitation are included to increase the chances for iPAS to become a first choice mHealth system for the ageing generation.",1
"Title: XMOS - Multimodal context and voice recognition for seamless voice control technology interfaces with low upfront cost Abstract: The “Internet of Things” is adding intelligent capabilities and connectivity to all kinds of objects in our environments. With potentially hundreds of smart devices surrounding us in our everyday, we need easier, more natural ways to interact with these technologies – which free our hands from controls, and help us put down our smartphones with their endless apps and distractions. While voice control is becoming a widely accepted alternative, it is not yet sufficiently robust and reliable for use in many situations.
XMOS are playing a fundamental role in the development of a next generation of human-machine interfaces – using natural language, the highly-developed systems of speech and gestures etc. used when people communicate. Embedded within their customers’ consumer electronics, this will enable devices to recognise and understand us, reading context and quickly interacting like another person would – but anonymously and securely, using sound and radar. XMOS’ capabilities will drive new classes of voice controlled devices, with low upfront cost allowing ubiquitous deployment of voice control, and higher quality user experience.
The experienced XMOS team has successfully commercialised their flexible XCore microprocessor, and is now focussed on voice interfaces as a high-growth sector. XMOS is already a leading provider of far-field voice interface technology, capable of separating a distant voice from noise in our living spaces, and has the most comprehensive portfolio of far-field voice interfaces.
The H2020 project will enable the realisation of the next-generation in XMOS voice control technologies, including a reconfigured architecture with disruptively low upfront cost, and new context recognition capabilities. XMOS will target a serviceable addressable market for IoT devices of $4 billion (CAGR of 32%), including smart TVs and audio equipment, consumer appliances and automotive applications, growing revenue by 20-fold and creating over 200 jobs by 2024.",1
"Title: ERIGrid - European Research Infrastructure supporting Smart Grid Systems Technology Development, Validation and Roll Out Abstract: Renewable energy sources are key enablers to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and to cope with the anthropogenic global warming. The intermittent behaviour of them and their limited storage capabilities present new challenges to power system operators in maintaining power quality and reliability. However, the increased availability of advanced automation and communication technologies has also provided new intelligent solutions to these challenges. Previous work has presented various new methods to operate highly interconnected power grids with corresponding components in a more effective way. As a consequence of these developments the traditional power system is transformed into a cyber-physical system, a Smart Grid. Previous and ongoing research activities have mainly focused on validating certain aspects of Smart Grids, but until now no integrated approach for analysing and evaluating complex configurations in a cyber-physical systems manner is available. 

The lack of system validation approaches for Smart Grids is especially addressed by ERIGrid. By providing a Pan-European research infrastructure ERIGrid supports the technology development as well as the roll out of Smart Grid solutions and concepts in Europe. It tackles a holistic, cyber-physical systems based approach by integrating 18 European research centres and institutions with outstanding research infrastructures and jointly develops common methods, concepts, and procedures. ERIGrid also integrates and enhances the necessary research services for analysing, validating and testing Smart Grid configurations. System level support and education for industrial and academic researchers in is provided as well to foster future innovation. 

ERIGrid addresses these challenging aims by providing a single entry point to the provided research infrastructure and offering a broad spectrum of services to researchers active in Smart Grids. This will strengthen the technical leadership of Europe in the energy domain.",0
"Title: PestNu - Field -testing and demonstration of digital and space based technologies with  agro-ecological and organic practices in systemic innovation Abstract: PestNu targets the field -testing and demonstration of digital and space based technologies (DST) and agro-ecological and organic practices (AOP) under a systemic approach to reduce the pesticides and fertilisers use, and loss of nutrients. The consortium brings novel DST including: AI robotic traps for real time pest monitoring; Autonomous mobile robots for pesticide monitoring and 3D spot spraying; Earth Observation missions with robust Agroradar AI algorithms to map soil/plant nutrients and pest plant inputs using Copernicus data/services; and in-situ and real-time nutrient analysers. All the DST will be interconnected to a user-centric cloud-based Farm Management System, which features a robust Decision Support System integrated with a blockchain based system for DST data evidence, integrity and AI models verification and with a cybersecurity platform to prevent cyber-attacks and IoT vulnerabilities. The AOP include: on-site production of biofertilisers from agricultural waste-waters through a robust automated drainage recycling system via an innovative enzymatic hydrolysis procedure; a novel foliar biopesticide formulated by circular bioeconomy operations, targeting fungal diseases with biostimulant effect; and advanced nutritional programs for organic farming. The showcase systemic DST & AOP solutions will be demonstrated and tested in aquaponic and hydroponic greenhouse and open-field vegetable cultivation in Greece and Spain. A Pesticide Reduction Program will evaluate the Maximum Residue and the Acceptable Daily Intake levels to ensure vegetable's food safety and LCA activities will be performed. All these systemic approaches will be performed under a strong collaboration among all the Farm to Fork stakeholders and European Commission services.",0
"Title: ACORN - Nanoparticle-Based Therapeutic Applications and Detection of Carbon Monoxide Releasing Molecules Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) has gathered increasing attention because of its role as a gasotransmitter with therapeutic and cell-protective effects. It is also recognised as a cell-signalling molecule where recent developments in the area of CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) and materials for controlled CO application have shown their importance with respect to delivery of such agents to their respective targets. However, despite their promise, their remains two major bottlenecks that may prevent these compounds from reaching the clinic. Firstly, the precise spatial-temporal CO release of CORMs is not target-specific. The CO molecule is highly diffusive and binds to haemoproteins, which are ubiquitous. Secondly, CORMs are made of metal carbonyl complexes and as organometallic compounds, there is the potential of heavy metal toxicity. Moreover, since CORMs are water-soluble they are distributed throughout the body, which can lead to further increased toxicities against healthy tissues. Our project aims to alleviate some of the problems of CORMs by a) developing a method to monitor CO release by MRI and optical imaging; b) reformulate CORMs by encapsulating inside nanomaterials (specifically the FDA approved PLGA as a nanocarrier) and c) provide targeting of the CORMs to their site of delivery by conjugating peptide targeting moieties to the surface of the PLGA nanoparticle. Through the completion of these activities, I;;, supported by its twinning partners, is in the best position to achieve an improved capability to compete for internationally competitive research funding and to access business stakeholders. By claiming its position in research and innovation networks IMM will effectively contribute to research excellence and value creation in health at European level.",0
"Title: ICT4CART - ICT Infrastructure for Connected and Automated Road Transport Abstract: ICT4CART, totally aligned with the work programme, is providing an ICT infrastructure to enable the transition towards road transport automation. To meet this high level objective ICT4CART is bringing together, adapting and improving technological advances from different industries, mainly telecom, automotive and IT. It adopts a hybrid communication approach where all the major wireless technologies, i.e. cellular, ITS G5 and LTE-V, are integrated under a flexible “sliced” network architecture. This architecture will ensure performance and resilience for different groups of applications according to the needs of higher levels of automation (L3 & L4). On top of that, a distributed IT environment for data aggregation and analytics will be implemented. This offers seamless integration and exchange of data and services between all the different actors, allowing 3rd parties to develop, deliver and provide innovative services, thus creating new business opportunities. Cyber-security and data privacy aspects will be duly considered throughout the whole ICT infrastructure. In addition, novel accurate localisation services, exploiting the cellular network and information from other sources, such as on-board sensors, especially in complex areas (e.g. urban), will be addressed. Standardisation and interoperability are of high interest within ICT4CART in order to ensure the impact of the project towards enabling the transition to higher levels of automation. In this context issues related to the frequency spectrum will be investigated, while through the organisation of relevant workshops the engagement of policy makers and public authorities is ensured. To achieve its objectives ICT4CART, instead of working in generic solutions with questionable impact, it builds on four specific high-value use cases (urban and highway) which will be demonstrated and validated under real-life conditions at the test sites in Austria, Germany, Italy and across the Italian-Austrian border.",1
"Title: ExoplANETS A - Exoplanet Athmosphere New Emission Transmission Spectra Analysis Abstract: The last twenty years have witnessed an exceptionally fast development in the field of the extra solar planets. The known exoplanets, 3500 to date, already show how diverse the planets in our galaxy can be. While the detection of exoplanets is an important ongoing field of activity, the characterization of their atmospheres has just begun and it is developing very rapidly. A lot can be learnt from spectroscopic observations of an exoplanet atmosphere; the molecular composition of giant exoplanet atmospheres can trace the planet's formation and evolution; the atmosphere of rocky exoplanets can host biosignature gases... However, the observations are challenging because the signal is often embedded in instrumental and telescope systematic noise. In the ExoplANETS_A project, we will develop novel data calibration and spectral extraction tools, as well as novel retrieval tools, based on 3D models of exoplanet atmospheres, to exploit archival data from ESA Space Science archives (HST) combined with NASA Space Archives (Spitzer, Kepler) and produce a homogeneous and reliable characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, to model successfully the atmosphere of an exoplanet, it is necessary to have a sound knowledge of the host star. To this end, we will collect a coherent and uniform database of the relevant properties of host stars from ESA Space Science archives (XMM, Gaia), combined with international space mission and ground-based data. These exoplanet and host star catalogues will be accompanied/interpreted with models to assess the importance of star – planet interactions. The knowledge gained from this project will be disseminated through peer-review publications and modelling tools will be publicly released.
In addition to the delivery of high level data products, state of the art tools, models and scientific publications, the project the project will ready us to rapidly exploit data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which is a highly competitive.",0
"Title: ROLEDS - Highly Efficient Photoemitters for Light-Emitting Diodes Based on Intramolecular Rotation Abstract: ""We have discovered a new class of photo- and electroluminescent complexes which are suitable for incorporation into organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and which give up to 100% internal quantum yield. The new compounds are particularly suitable for the fabrication of OLEDs via cheap solution-processing techniques and have so far reached 27% external quantum efficiency, a record for any solution-processed device. The new complexes have a linear, rotationally flexible structure, and it is this rotation that allows 100% of the excitation energy to be harvested, by a new emission mechanism (“rotationally accessed spin-state inversion”, RASI). OLEDs are widely used as flat-screen displays (TVs, smartphones), a multi-billion dollar market worldwide. The industry-leading emitters are based on complexes of iridium, one of the rarest elements on earth. Our emitters are compounds of copper, silver and gold, suitable as “slot-in” replacements of iridium. IPR is protected by two UK and one PCT World patent applications. The key discovery is that in certain types of coordination complexes based on carbene ligands the excited singlet state sinks below the excited triplet state during molecular rotation. To our knowledge this is the first realization of """"spin-state inverted"""" materials, until now discussed only as a theoretical concept. The result is efficient, very fast light harvesting with highly desirable short (sub-microsecond) excitation lifetimes, leading to high display brightness (in prototypes 20 times brighter than a HD TV screen), with potential lighting applications.""",1
"Title: TAPAS - TArgeting Platelet Adhesion receptors in thrombosiS Abstract: TAPAS will position Europe at the forefront of innovative research to prevent thrombosis and thromboinflammation, and will train a uniquely-qualified cohort of ESRs in a highly intersectorial and multi-disciplinary programme that will equip them with the knowledge and transferable skills required in the broad biomedical sector. The research will focus on platelets which are small cells in the blood that play a critical role in prevention of excessive bleeding following injury (haemostasis). Activation of platelets in diseased vessels gives rise to thrombotic disorders such as heart attack and stroke, two of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Patients at risk of thrombosis are treated with medicines that inhibit platelets for life, but many patients still undergo thrombotic episodes or encounter serious bleeds through diminished haemostasis. There is thus an urgent need for novel and safe anti-platelet medicines that powerfully target thrombosis but preserve haemostasis.  In TAPAS, an original and innovative approach will be undertaken to find new ways to target thrombosis through co-operation of academic experts in distinct disciplines with key skills from the private sector. TAPAS will generate and integrate knowledge from analytical complex ‘omics’, advanced microscopy, cell biology, microfluidics, in vivo models, contemporary systems biology and high throughput screens to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention and novel lead compounds or biologics. The research skills developed in this programme are applicable to other complex diseases and represent essential training in modern day research for the next cohort of academic and private sector scientists that are able to convert complex biological understanding into new medicines. The shared knowledge and close interaction between beneficiaries and partners makes this programme ideally suited to an EJD and will deliver 15 ESRs in 21st century biomedical research.",0
"Title: WIPE - Wafer scale Integration of Photonics and Electronics Abstract: The WIPE project aims at developing hybrid electronic-photonic chips as a key enabling technology for data transmission purposes. It aims at bringing photonics to a new level by developing a concept that can be well industrialised. This sustains EU leadership in photonics, as is the ambition of the work program.   

A new wafer-scale technology will thus be developed for direct and intimate attachment of III-V Indium-Phosphide (InP) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and BiCMOS electronic chips (ICs). The ICs contain the driver, receiver andcontrol electronics for the PIC and enable direct connection to polymer optical waveguides. This technology of ‘wafer scale heterogeneous integration’ enables high-performance and high-density photonic-electronic (photronic) modules are created having a lower energy consumption, lower packaging complexity and lower cost compared to modules using more traditional interconnection techniques like wire bonding and laser welding of fibre connections. 

Next to the new bonding technology, an integrated module design technology is developed for efficient co-design of hybrid photonic and electronic modules. A library consisting of photonic/electronic standard modules, is created leveraging the process design kits (PDKs) of the most important European foundries of photonic chips in combination with a powerful BiCMOS. These tools are of significantimportance to industry, since they offer photronic module designers a standardised approach that highly facilitates the module design for SMEs and affordable manufacturing by photonic and electronic foundries. The WIPE approach will be proven by showing the feasibility of a 400Gb/s transceiver for data centre application.",1

"Title: 5G-ACE - Beyond 5G: 3D Network Modelling for THz-based Ultra-Fast Small Cells Abstract: 5G-ACE is engineered to be a two year Standard European Fellowship (EF) that aims to strengthen the ER (Experience Researcher)’s repository of scientific and transferable skills to place him in a strong position towards professional maturity, either at the host (University of South Wales) by targeting an “Academic Position by Research”, or as an independent researcher at leading international research centres and universities in Europe. The personalized training will identify key use cases and frequency bands for THz-based mobile communications, develop new 3D network models that take into account spatial coupling by re-examining legacy engineering tools such as stochastic geometry through interdisciplinary design, and involve practical experimentation that will be implemented as scheduled secondments at Nokia Bell Labs (Belgium), and Sigint Solutions Ltd (Cyprus). To complement the scientific training, the ER’s skill set will be enriched through a tailor-made Personal Career Development Plan (PCDP) that not only includes the core transferable skills (e.g, academic teaching, IPR management, research commercialization), but will identify other relevant complementary skills to provide a well-rounded research personality ready to embark on his 5G legacy and beyond.",1
"Title: TopoLight - SOFT MATTER PLATFORM FOR OPTICAL DEVICES VIA ENGINEERING OF NON-LINEAR TOPOLOGICAL STATES OF LIGHT Abstract: Liquid crystals (LC) are advanced materials known for their anisotropic optical properties allowing to control the polarisation of light and are used in various optical devices. Now the time has come to push the LC applications further by implementing them into novel polariton devices to control topological properties of light. TopoLight deals for the first time with non-linear effects in room temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and topological states of light uncovering astonishing possibilities of external electrical control over spin-orbit interaction due to artificially engineered fields acting on photons. With a two main technological approaches: originating from solid-state physics and developing molecular control of LC devices, we aim to demonstrate novel systems of tunable topological emitters based on room temperature BEC substantial in topological photonics and information encoding.

We will design, fabricate and investigate photonic structures to start an innovative integrated hybrid organic/liquid-crystal system for room temperature BEC research and applications. Our disruptive innovation is based on the idea of external electrical control over spin-orbit coupling due to artificially engineered fields acting on photons, which has never been realised in photonics. We will create topologically protected states of light: unidirectional flow robust against backscattering and vortex states carrying quantised angular momentum. We will utilise the strong non-linearities observed in organic microcavities and SOC in liquid-crystal cavities to the demonstrate single photon polarisation switches capable for ternary logic. Our OLC microcavities (MCs) platform will combine a strong emissivity with the ease of fabrication, low costs, and scalability and room temperature operation.",0
"Title: ACASIAS - Advanced Concepts for Aero-Structures with Integrated Antennas and Sensors Abstract: The overall objective of ACASIAS is to contribute to the reduction of energy consumption of future aircraft by improving aerodynamic performance and by facilitating the integration of novel efficient propulsion systems such as contra-rotating open rotor (CROR) engines.

The aerodynamic performance is improved by the conformal and structural integration of antennas. The installation of CROR engines is facilitated by installation of an Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) system in the fuselage. The integration of such a system in fuselage panels will annoying noise in the cabin caused by multi-harmonic sound pressure level which is radiated by CROR engines. CROR engines are able to realize up to 25% fuel and CO2 savings compared to equivalent-technology turbofan engines (http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890003194.pdf).

The ACASIAS project focuses on challenges posed by the development of aero- structures with multifunctional capabilities. The following concepts structural concepts are considered:
• A composite stiffened ortho-grid fuselage panel for integrating Ku-band SATCOM antenna tiles.
• A fuselage panel with integrated sensors and wiring for reduction of CROR cabin noise.
• A smart winglet with integrated blade antenna (integrated substrates into special foam, partly covered by a 1 mm glass/quartz epoxy layer).
• A Fibre Metal Laminate GLARE panel with integrated VHF communication slot antenna.

The 36 months action with a project cost of 5.8 MEuros will bring together 11 partners from 6 countries covering the three main disciplines required: (composite) structures, advanced antennas and miniaturized sensors in a multi-disciplinary project. The project innovations facilitated by integration of these disciplines, as well as resulting in operational cost reduction and decreased emissions for airlines, will also lead to a more competitive supply chain in the aviation sector, which increasingly uses composite structures.",1
"Title: PEDIGREE - Pluralistic Economics for Development in Green Economic Enhancement Abstract: The question of which economic framework (or sets of frameworks) is (are) appropriate for providing policy prescriptions
conducive to ecological sustainable has gained renewed interest within the community of ecological economists and
political economists. To help answer this question I propose to investigate the suitability of four economic frameworks —
neoclassical environmental economics, non-Walrasian neoclassical environmental economics, institutional ecological
economics, and ecological Marxian political economy, for providing effective and coherent policy prescriptions for renewable
and sustainable energy resources, specifically for electricity generation.
The inquiry will be both philosophical/methodological and empirical. The four frameworks will be interrogated against case
studies of the UK, Germany, Norway, France, Canada, and the US. The case studies will be comprised of analyses of the
socio-economic, historical, political, and cultural backdrop of energy resources in each country. The results of this
interrogation will then be used to assess the suitability of the four frameworks for providing policy prescriptions conducive to
ecological sustainability with regards to their respective methodologies including ontology, epistemology, methodology (to
include methods as well), and ideology. The case for methodological pluralism will be assessed and a notion of pluralism
developed for economic frameworks concerned with ecological sustainability.
The benefits that will be gained from undertaking this research program at the ERA level will accrue to economists and
social scientists first by giving them better analytical and conceptual tools, and all those, including policy makers, politicians,
and business leaders who depend on those tools afterwards through better results.",0
"Title: ESPRIT - Easily diStributed Personal RapId Transit Abstract: Today, transportation both to/from city-centres and within peri-urban areas, is unsatisfactory in terms of congestion, environmental and societal aspects. To answer identified needs, the Easily diStributed Personal RapId Transit (ESPRIT) project aims to develop a purpose-built, light weight L6 category electric vehicle that can be stacked together to gain space. Thanks to pioneering coupling systems, up to 8 ESPRIT vehicles can be nested together in a road train, 7 being towed for an efficient redistribution of fleets and a smartly-balanced and cost efficient transport system. Within the project, 2 user scenarios are foreseen: a one-way carsharing system within city centres and a last-kilometre personal mobility system to existing public transport infrastructures in peri-urban areas. These will be tested through 3 different geographical use cases (Glasgow, Lyon and L’ L’Hospitalet de LLobregat near Barcelona).
This innovative transport system concept will be demonstrated to TRL5 though state-of-the-art developments of diverse technological bricks (including vehicle and road train architecture, coupling and guiding systems, kinetic and dynamic behaviour management systems, efficient energy supply and rapid charge battery strategies). To prove the ESPRIT concept, the project will also work on modelling and simulation tools to predict, once ESPRIT vehicles are deployed, the economic, social and environmental benefits as well as key operating strategies.
This concept will incite citizens to use public transport and carsharing solutions rather than their private vehicles leading to seamless intermodal transport, decongestion, significant reduction of noise and air pollution. To reach all stakeholders, the ESPRIT project will not only rely on its technical expertise but also on the knowledge and network of its end user community represented by several partners as well as the Advisor Board which includes carsharing organisations, public authorities and transport operators.",1
"Title: EBiSC2 - EBiSC2 – A sustainable European Bank for induced pluripotent Stem Cells Abstract: EBiSC2 builds on the achievements of the European Bank for iPSCs (EBiSC1) in centralising existing capacities across Europe in a unique banking and distribution infrastructure for research use in response to the increasing demand for human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Significant progress towards this aim has been made by EBiSC1; further resources, however, are required to ensure self-sustainability. Key partners of EBiSC1 who have delivered major assets of the current bank, join efforts to establish EBiSC2 as self-sustainable, central bank. 
Based on a gap analysis of the EBiSC1 endeavours towards sustainability, and focussing on user demand, scientific excellence and productivity, EBiSC2 will deploy a business strategy for a sustainable, non-for-profit bank providing access to disease-relevant and quality-controlled iPSCs, along with comprehensive data and freedom to operate for academic and commercial use. To meet evolving requirements from industry and academia, the cell catalogue will be constantly enriched through on-demand generation of new iPSC lines, including gene-edited lines and isogenic controls, iPSC-derived and progenitor cells. EBiSC2 will distribute cell lines and develop a range of additional cell services (incl. screening panels of disease-relevant iPSC and control lines in ready-to-use-formats) to extend its offer, while reducing operational costs through state-of-the-art upscaling and automation enabling bulk production of standardised high-quality cells. Proof-of-concept studies performed jointly by academia and industry will demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the lines for disease modelling and screening and enrich the EBiSC2 catalogue with extensive data. 
To bundle resources, EBiSC2 focuses on collaboration with iPSC programmes and aims to serve as central hub for EU-funded projects to bank their iPSC lines, and thus, enable long-term access by the research community to the results of European investments.",0
"Title: FrEQuMP - Frequency-encoded quantum multi-photon interference devices Abstract: Optical quantum computing and quantum simulation rely on multi-photon interference effects, between many photons in a larger number of optical paths or modes. In particular in Gaussian Boson Sampling protocols, single-mode squeezed states are input to an optical circuit implementing a transformation on the modes, which creates a complex multi-mode squeezed state. Sampling from such a state with single photon detectors is thought to be an intractable problem to simulate with classical computers, and has useful applications, for instance in calculating molecular vibronic spectra and in identifying densely connected sub-graphs of a network. This motivates building quantum-optical devices to implement Gaussian Boson Sampling. However, it is resource intensive to create a usefully large state using many separate squeezed sources and a circuit, and very technically challenging to avoid photon loss and to maintain interferometric stability. Here, I propose to carry out Gaussian Boson Sampling and related experiments by directly generating multi-mode squeezed states encoded in frequency, from a single source with reconfigurable frequency correlations. Using frequency channels to represent the modes is very compact because they can all propagate along the same spatial path, and this also ensures interferometric stability. Directly generating the desired state will avoid having the photons propagate through a lossy circuit, allowing scaling to higher photon numbers, and frequency encoding will make large numbers of modes readily available, surpassing the state-of-the-art in spatially-encoded circuits.",1
"Title: FreeATPOC - Towards an instrument-free future of molecular diagnostics at the point-of-care Abstract: Molecular diagnostics is still primarily a lab-based method. Emerging technologies for application at the point of care (POC) or need, i.e., where a patient or a sample is, have started gaining a big part of the molecular diagnostics market. Interestingly, available methods are divided in two groups: sophisticated instruments for ultra-sensitive temperature-regulated enzymatic amplification of nucleic acids and extremely simple paper-based immuno-diagnostic kits. Complexity, the main disadvantage of the former, results in their poor translation to several applications at the POC. Simplicity, often accompanied by failures, of the latter is the reason for their slow adoption even in resource limited areas. Our vision is an instrument-free approach that combines the advantages of both groups, i.e., a method that does not use heaters or modules that require electricity, infrastructure and maintenance, but, still, takes advantage of enzymatically-amplified nucleic acids detection. To achieve the above, novel diagnostic tools for genetic amplification based on ligases, polymerases and restriction enzymes operating at ambient temperature will be developed, combined with quantitative smartphone colorimetric/UV detection. The global applicability of the new approach will be demonstrated during infectious disease (Influenza and HIV) testing in human samples (blood and swabs) and plant pathogens (Xylella fastidiosa) in plant-tissues. In all cases, we aim for a time-to-result of less than 60 min, demonstrated sensitivities down to the clinically/field relevant values and a final cost in the order of $1 per assay. Combination of Free@POC concept with newly developed predictive models will expand its utility to monitoring disease outbreaks and their spreading. This new generation of instrument-free molecular diagnostics is expected to revolutionize nucleic acid analysis at the POC but also in applications beyond resulting in substantial societal as well as economic benefits.",1
"Title: METHID - Observation and Modelling of Radiocarbon in Atmospheric Methane for Methane Source Identification Abstract: Observation and Modelling of Radiocarbon in Atmospheric Methane for Methane Source Identification

Greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global climate change, and methane (CH4) is the second most important contributor after carbon dioxide (CO2). Major sources of methane are both natural (wetlands) and anthropogenic (agriculture, landfills and fossil fuels). Current efforts to assess the anthropogenic CH4 influence on climate change and the effectiveness of mitigation policies for CH4 are limited by large uncertainties in estimates of total methane emissions and their attribution to various sources by accounting-based techniques. This project will pioneer and apply innovative techniques for atmospheric observation and modelling of radiocarbon in CH4 that will enable unique quantification of fossil fuel vs. biogenic CH4 sources at regional and global scales, thereby improving the estimation and attribution of CH4 emissions of different types. The proposed work will significantly advance the frontier of current research on atmospheric methane and the characterization of anthropogenic sources on policy-relevant scales, and it has the potential to influence climate policy and industrial practices over the next 10-20 years.",0
"Title: RIV-ESCAPE - RIVEr emissions of greenhouse gases from warming landSCAPEs Abstract: Rivers around the world release large quantities of greenhouse gas, with an estimated 1.8 ± 0.3 PgC yr-1 released as carbon dioxide (CO2), and ~20-25 TgC yr-1 as methane (CH4). These fluxes are equivalent to half of the annual increase in CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere due to human activities. However, we cannot yet quantify how river CO2 and CH4 emissions will change, nor assess their potential to amplify future climate warming. There are two main challenges: i) the main drivers of CO2 and CH4 release from rivers (supply of carbon and the dynamics of river flow) change simultaneously, and their relative importance is obscured in existing data, limiting our ability to build and test predictive models; ii) the age of river CO2 and CH4 is poorly constrained, meaning that we cannot determine whether this is anthropogenic carbon that is leaking out from prior storage on land, or whether it derives from ancient carbon stores in the landscape. 

RIV-ESCAPE will transform our understanding by recognising the need for direct measurements that combine river CO2 and CH4 flux, river flow dynamics and C supply at high temporal resolution (minutes to hours) over seasonal timescales, across nested scales in river catchments. Such novel field installations could be used anywhere to improve our understanding: we will focus on Arctic rivers that are experiencing pronounced warming and hold large stores of ancient carbon in soils. In parallel, we will use cutting-edge isotope geochemistry methods for river gases, waters and sediments to quantify the controls on the age and source of CO2 and CH4 in rivers around the world. The new empirical data will combine with physical and numerical experiments to provide a step-change in our knowledge of how changes in temperature and precipitation set river greenhouse gas source and the rate of release, allowing us to assess for the first time the sensitivity of river CO2 and CH4 emissions to future warming.",0
"Title: FUTURE-MOBILE - Distributed Massive MIMO for Next Generation Wireless Communications Abstract: In view of the rapid increase in demand for mobile data services, next generation wireless communication systems will have
to provide greatly increased capacity density and high data rates greater than 50Gbps. However, satisfying these
requirements for increasing numbers of users and connected devices, and increasingly bandwidth, processing power and
energy-hungry applications will require a transformation in the way in which current mobile and wireless networks perform.
Recently, massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology, where each base station (BS) is equipped with a large
number of antenna elements (typically tens or even hundreds) has emerged as a key enabler to achieve a 1000 times data
rate and enormous spectral and energy efficiency. In order for massive MIMO to become a reality, the proposed work aims
to explore transformative methods for the design of innovative techniques in 3 key challenging areas of massive MIMO
communication systems: (i) fundamental limits; (ii), (ii) transmission strategy; and (iii) caching mechanisms. The solution is
achieved with small remote antenna units equipped with compact massive MIMO arrays deployed over certain coverage
regions, and developing practical signalling schemes, network coordination, and management protocols.",1
"Title: 5GZORRO - Zero-touch security and trust for ubiquitous computing and connectivity in 5G networks. Abstract: Despite the progress of last years, 5G today is not yet at a stage of complete achievement of the promised performances and functions: different application profiles (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) do not easily coexist in network slices; slicing is casted in various different forms; network analytics are not at end-to-end scope; services do not span multiple operator domains yet. 

5GZORRO consortium envisions the evolution of 5G to achieve truly production-level support of diverse Vertical applications, which coexist on a highly pervasive shared network infrastructure, through automated end-to-end network slicing, across multiple operators and infrastructure/resource providers, who can share heterogeneous types of resources (spectrum, virtualized radio access, virtualized edge/core). 

5GZORRO uses distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to implement cognitive network orchestration and management with minimal manual intervention (Zero-Touch Automation). Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are adopted to implement flexible and efficient distributed security and trust across the various parties involved in a 5G end-to-end service chain. With these, we can implement an evolved 5G Service Layer for Smart Contracts among multiple non-trusted parties, to allow SLA monitoring, spectrum sharing, intelligent and automated data-driven resource discovery and management. Our cross domain security & trust orchestration coupled with service lifecycle automation can enforce security policies in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments. 

Three use cases validate our research in 5GBarcelona and 5TONIC/Madrid test facilities: Smart Contracts for Ubiquitous Computing/Connectivity, Dynamic Spectrum Allocation, Pervasive virtual CDNs over 3rd-party edge resources. 

5GZORRO target stakeholders are telecom operators, vertical slice owners/operators, spectrum owners, regulators, passive/ active facility owners, many of which are in our consortium of 13 top 5G players from 7 different EU countries.",1
"Title: NanoCuI - Nano-Copper Iodide: A New Material for High Performance P-Type Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Abstract: p-Type dye-sensitized photocathodes (p-DSSCs) are a new type of solar energy device.  They promise to increase the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by enabling tandem cells that absorb light at both electrodes, in similar fashion to multi-junction semiconductor PV.  However, no component of the p-DSSC is fully optimised, and the nickel oxide (NiO) substrates used as the p-type semiconductor appear to be a particular weak point, due to their inefficient charge transport.  In this project, we will develop new copper(I) halide electrodes which transport charge much better, and will potentially form the heart of new, efficient p-DSSCs.",0
"Title: IoT4Industry - Towards smarter means of production in European manufacturing SMEs through the use of the Internet of Things technologies Abstract: The proportion of the manufacturing industry is currently decreasing in developed European countries’ GDP. Industry 4.0 - also called smart manufacturing, digital industry or industry of the future – provides several technological responses to the challenging competitive market. Indeed, the integration of the Internet of Things and related components - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Security, Cloud Computing and Big Data - in manufacturing SMEs will improve efficiency and flexibility in production and consumption. However, it requires a more integrated and cooperative approach due to the high interdisciplinarity which has been introduced. Above all, not all manufacturing companies, and in particular SMEs, have access to smarter means of production, due to costs and efforts in the integration and implementation, possible aversion or readiness to ICT technologies, and other obstacles related to cyber and physical security. The IoT4Industry project connects 3 Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) clusters having strong competences in IoT with 4 Advanced Manufacturing clusters having access to tool manufacturers and manufacturing SMEs in order to encourage cross-border and cross-sectorial collaboration between SMEs from these two sectors. Starting from the analysis of needs in manufacturing SMEs from diverse sectors in Europe (aerospace, automotive, medicine, ...) on the one hand, and the IoT technology offer on the other hand, the project will put in place favourable framework conditions to enable matchmaking and encourage the creation of smarter manufacturing tools and their integration in manufacturing SMEs. A hundred of support cases involving SMEs corresponding to different development stages (feasibility, prototyping, demonstration) will be selected through a call for proposals to receive funding and support, in view of further developing this new industrial value chain in European SMEs and improve their competitiveness on the global stage.",1
"Title: ACTiCLOUD - ACTivating resource efficiency and large databases in the CLOUD Abstract: Despite their proliferation as a dominant computing paradigm, cloud computing systems lack effective mechanisms to manage their vast amounts of resources efficiently, leading to severe resource waste and ultimately limiting their applicability to large classes of critical applications that pose non-moderate resource demands. This creates a significant need to lift existing technological barriers of actual fluidity and scalability of cloud resources towards promoting cloud computing as a critical cornerstone for digital economy.

ACTiCLOUD proposes a novel cloud computing architecture for drastically improved management of cloud resources, targeting 1.5x increase in resource efficiency and more than 10x in scalability. By utilizing modest investments on hardware intelligence that enables true resource disaggregation between multiple servers, we will progress current state-of-the-art in hypervisors and cloud management systems promoting holistic resource management at the rack scale and across distributed cloud sites. On top of this, we will evolve the ecosystem around in-memory databases, a core component for extremely demanding and highly critical classes of applications that up to now have faced severe difficulties in matching their resource requirements with state-of-the-art cloud offerings, with a final goal to provide cost-efficient and highly performant DataBase-as-a-Service (DBaaS) cloud platforms.

ACTiCLOUD builds on top of cutting-edge European technologies for cloud servers brought into the project by Numascale and Kaleao, and extends OnApp's MicroVisor, an innovative hypervisor to virtualize resources at the rack-scale. Furthermore it joins the forces of highly acclaimed academic institutions to address key research challenges and extend the capabilities of OpenStack and JVM. Finally, it applies the foreseen innovation to MonetDB, the column-store database pioneer, and Neo4j, the world-leader in graph databases.",1
"Title: AfricanBioServices - Linking biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services in the Great Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem (GSME) - drivers of change, causalities and sustainable management strategies Abstract: The direct dependence of humans on ecosystem services is by far strongest in developing regions where poverty restricts access to resources. This dependency also makes people in developing countries more sensitive to climate change than their developed counterparts. Increasing human populations deteriorates natural habitat, biodiversity and ecosystems services which spiral into poverty and low human welfare. This calls for innovative solutions that encompass the entire socio-ecological-economic system, as recognized on a global scale in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. However, innovative and practical solutions require downscaling to regional levels for identifying concrete sets of drivers of change. For Africa specifically, the interplay of human population growth, land use change, climate change and human well-being is a major challenge. This project focuses on the Serengeti-Maasai Mara Ecosystem and associated agricultural areas, a region in East Africa that encompasses parts of Kenya and Tanzania. The ecosystem is world-famous for key aspects of its biodiversity, such as the migration of 1.3 million wildebeest. This ‘flagship ecosystem’ role will enhance the international interest in the project. In this project, internationally leading researchers from Norway, the Netherlands, Scotland, Denmark and Germany are teaming up with strong local partners in Tanzania and Kenya. The research will be organised in seven interlinked work packages: 1) assemble and integrate the so far separate Kenyan and Tanzanian relevant data on the region; 2) quantify the connections between human population growth, land use change, climate change and biodiversity change; 3) test how biodiversity change leads to changes in key ecosystem services; 4) quantify the dependence of human livelihoods on these ecosystem services. We will implement innovative ways for communication and dissemination of the results of ‘continuous engagement’ by local stakeholders.",0
"Title: MATCH - The Alliance for Materials way to the creation of the MATerials Common House - MATCH Abstract: ""With this proposal, a qualified and assorted representative group of the European Materials community, intend to propose an activity for further boosting and reinforcing a  concept launched by Alliance for Materials (A4M): the creation of a strong, sustainable, inclusive network where any European Materials players (from Industry, Research, University) could feel comfortable and can gain real value for her/his own interest and expectations as far as Materials R&D&I is concerned. 
This partnership promotes the integration of concerted and strategic challenges of national,  regional and European needs in the field. 

The MATCH proposal is focused in 4 main targets, crucial for the promotion of  European sustainable development and innovation actions, as  anticipated by future challenges to: 
• the enlargement and effective improvement  within the existing Materials  network at EU level;
• the multidisciplinary connection of Materials to a large number of fields relevant for European growth and where concerted management actions are needed;
• the integration with existing and/or  promotion of new Materials networks at National and Inter/Regional levels;
• the integration of  EU and  national and regional networks in a sustainable (long-lasting) effectively aligned  network hubs.

MATCH foresees the establishment of comprehensive networks focusing on complementary stakeholder areas  to enable  promotion  of connections between the scientific creativity  represented by academia and the enterprises to focus on market needs.

As a result of the MATCH project any organisation interested in materials research in Europe will have a single reference network through which to obtain information, contacts and guidance in an efficient and transparent way. Established and well-connected material research stakeholders will be able to intensify their activities and extend their collaborative activities at European level, realising the A4M concept for the ”The Materials Common House"""".""",0
"Title: ARIA-VALUSPA - Artificial Retrieval of Information Assistants - Virtual Agents with Linguistic Understanding, Social skills, and Personalised Aspects Abstract: The ARIA-VALUSPA project will create a ground-breaking new framework that will allow easy creation of Artificial Retrieval of Information Assistants (ARIAs) that are capable of holding multi-modal social interactions in challenging and unexpected situations. The system can generate search queries and return the information requested by interacting with humans through virtual characters. These virtual humans will be able to sustain an interaction with a user for some time, and react appropriately to the user's verbal and non-verbal behaviour when presenting the requested information and refining search results. Using audio and video signals as input, both verbal and non-verbal components of human communication are captured. Together with a rich and realistic emotive personality model, a sophisticated dialogue management system decides how to respond to a user's input, be it a spoken sentence, a head nod, or a smile. The ARIA uses special speech synthesisers to create emotionally coloured speech and a fully expressive 3D face to create the chosen response. Back-channelling, indicating that the ARIA understood what the user meant, or returning a smile are but a few of the many ways in which it can employ emotionally coloured social signals to improve communication.  
As part of the project, the consortium will develop two specific implementations of ARIAs for two different industrial applications. A ‘speaking book’ application will create an ARIA with a rich personality capturing the essence of a novel, whom users can ask novel-related questions. An ‘artificial travel agent’ web-based ARIA will be developed to help users find their perfect holiday – something that is difficult to do with existing web interfaces such as those created by booking.com or tripadvisor.",1
"Title: KREDs in GSBs - Directed evolution of ketoreductases in gel-shell beads Abstract: Optically pure secondary alcohols are required in the manufacture of many pharmaceutical products. Ketoreductases (KREDs) capable of reduction of ketones to the corresponding secondary alcohol have been improved through classical directed evolution campaigns but a limiting factor has always been the challenge of matching selection conditions to the final scaled-up reaction. Here we propose a solution to that problem.  The Host group previously described the formation of gel-shell beads, agarose beads surrounded by a size-selective shell (Nature Chemistry 2014, 6:791). The beads allow screening of individual members of an enzyme library using flow cytometry.  As small molecules can be readily exchanged, while enzymes are retained, the process not only affords precise control over selection conditions but also makes it ideal for continuous flow processes. To support this endeavour, sensitive assays for the high throughput detection of ketoreductase activity and enantioselectivity will be developed. Directed evolution will then be performed with selection for the efficient use of macromolecular derivatives of the NAD(P)H cofactor and improved tolerance to high substrate /solvent concentrations. Throughout the project, intensive contact will be maintained with Industrial Partner GlaxoSmithKline, leading up to flow bed reactor trials during a secondment. This project will provide the Beneficiary with an excellent training in biocatalysis, broadening his skill set and opening up new career opportunities in Europe’s growing Green Chemistry Sector. The Host laboratory is at the forefront of directed evolution of enzymes. Through the secondment at GSK, the Beneficiary will be able to transfer this technology to industry. Excellent training courses offered by the University of Cambridge will further aid his professional development. This project seeks to help Europe meet Part 12 of Horizon 2020, which is to be communicated through a well-planned series of Public Engagements.",0
"Title: iPIM - Development of an Intelligent Onshore Pipeline Integrity Monitoring System Abstract: In iPIM a developed prototype of sophisticated non-destructive technique (NDT) for structural health monitoring system (SHM) of oil and gas (O&G) pipelines will be further modified so that the system can be made available for commercialization. iPIM will continuously monitor the pipeline for cracks, corrosion and other faults and send the information over a wireless communication system to the network monitoring centre where the fault will be displayed over a 3D map of the pipeline. This will help the pipeline operators to take preventive and corrective measures before any accident stemmed from pipeline failure occurs.  A low profile wireless Acoustic Emission (AE) and Long Range Ultrasonic (LRU) dual mode sensors will be permanently attached on the pipeline with a collar installed 100m apart from each other that can monitor 50m of pipeline in either side. The sensors will act in passive AE mode in normal operation and on detection of an anomaly will switch to LRU mode to locate and determine the characteristics of the anomaly. An artificial neural network (ANN) and data fusion system will intelligently manage data acquisition and analysis functions based on data received from the installed sensor nodes. An energy harvesting system will be developed to power the onsite electronics. A new software will be developed that will enable advanced signal processing with improved signal/noise separation in handling sensor data, thus supporting more sensitive measurement and more effective analysis.
iPIM will ensure onshore pipeline safety and reduce cost due to pipeline failure in the Europe. The expected profit to the SMEs generated through the exploitation of the iPIM system is in the order of €56 Million, representing a return on investment (RoI) of 612%. With revenue per capita in the sector of €100,000 per employee, the creation of some 600 new, high-skilled, high-technology jobs in Europe has been anticipated.",1
"Title: MovAiD - Movement Assisting Devices: Manufacturing of personalized Kineto-Dynamics parts and products for workers, elderly and children Abstract: I - Over forty million workers in the EU are affected by work-place related musculoskeletal disorders, as a result of working in painful or tiring positions and handling heavy loads with repetitive hand or arm movements.
II - The aging population is growing fast and approaching the mean age where loss of function and hence loss of mobility is to begin. In addition to diabetic and obesity, in 5 years’ time, there will be significant increase in number of elderly people who require mobility aids or orthoses which need to be fitted in order to enable population to live at their home independently.
III - A number of neuromuscular disorders, along with other pathologies such as arthrogryposis, affect children motor patterns in the limbs causing motion deficits.

To achieve long term benefits for the European society, the proposal addresses those three groups with the development of a next generation of Movement Assistive Devices (MADs): innovative, “passive” and highly customized kineto-dynamic equipment, built to provide natural compensation of human movements (both upper and lower limbs). MADs will be conceived and developed exploiting a generative design approach (capable to combine unique morphological characteristics with personalized kinematics) coupled with an innovative additive multi-material technology ( capable to deliver specific mechanical properties),

By delivering products for mobility enhancement of the older persons, the project directly contributes in dealing with familiar ageing society issues by decreasing the need of care sector and enhancing a reduction of falls with an overall consequent saved costs. In workplace safety, the MAD fosters correct kinesis, injury prevention and improved productivity. Meanwhile, placing focus on the last, third group, MovAiD promotes the final stage of a modern sustainable society by augmenting the quality of life of its youngest members with difficulties in mobility.",0
"Title: KoolZone - KoolZone- refrigeration control technology to minimise food waste, avoid food poisoning and minimise energy consumption Abstract: The respected environmentalist David Hawken recently assessed that better refrigerant management could reduce global CO2 emissions by 96t globally by 2050. Demand for refrigeration is growing, driven by developing countries and implementation of food safety legislation, e.g. HACCP. Better management of refrigeration is a clear part of better refrigerant management. Increased refrigeration and legislation is a proportionate response to the million food poisoning cases diagnosed annually in the UK, 500 of which result in death. Food temperature monitoring in commercial sectors is mandatory in the UK, EU, US, Far East & Australia, where HACCP compliance is used to safeguard food safety. The majority of food producers, handlers, caterers and retailerls uses manual records due to the high cost (€600 hardware only)  and complication of retrofitting automated logging or more efficient control. Many businesses over-cool to avoid bad press & litigation from ill customers, needlessly increasing energy consumption. The lack of 24/7 monitoring also leads to stock loss for food businesses. If a refrigeration unit fails out of hours, the operator will not know for several hours, meaning that stock is no longer fit for consumption.   
Our focus is to create a disruptive, very low cost (€7.50/month) complete refrigeration monitor and reporting system (inc. SaaS) for only €110 up front hardware cost. We have solved technical challenges around battery life, low-power electronics, enclosure design and antenna design. Our prototypes are genuine plug-and-play with zero on-site integration costs. They enable 24/7 refrigerator montiroing, plus a user portal with functionality to generate reports to satisfy HACCP inspections. This project seeks to scale-up our innovation, enhancing manufacturability and porting to scalable, secure communication and network protocols.",1
"Title: iNTACT - Commercialisation of the world’s first iNTelligent Access Cover Technology for the protection of ALL underground infrastructure. Abstract: All infrastructure that underpins life as we know it runs underground in some form whether it be telecoms, water, gas or electricity. All underground infrastructure is only accessible through one method – inspection chambers. These inspection chambers are common and 100s can exist within a small area. To prevent criminal damage to infrastructure and ensure safety, all of these chambers are covered with access covers. There have been no major innovations of access covers in recent times and most remain completely unsecure and vulnerable. Requests to increase security has resulted in simple measures taken in the form of padlocks and key-locks, which still leave significant vulnerabilities. Alongside these vulnerabilities, covers in strategic sites need daily monitoring. This is currently done manually with physical inspections. There is a significant cost incurred for this.

We are Hugslock Systems and have developed a solution that will secure all underground infrastructure. We have created iNTelligent Access Cover Technology ‘iNTACT’ that will truly revolutionize the security of underground critical infrastructures. iNTACT is the world’s first remote lockable access cover. It is secure, impenetrable and intelligent. Intelligence is embedded within the cover in the form of sensors that can offer various monitoring capabilities such as gas, heat, water sensors, Infrared CCTV, motion, bio-hazard and seismic.

iNTACT completely removes the need for any physical inspections, as the remote-operated locks can be remotely monitored from a central control room. We have strong market-pull from utility providers such as SITEL of the Czech Republic and organizations such the Ministry of Defence. Based on early interest we have built bottom-up 5 year forecasts to generate cumulative turnover of €28.9m to generate €15.1m PBIT. Based on total investments of €1.85m, this will achieve a ROI of 7.2:1 and payback on investment in 29.8 months.",1
"Title: 5G-TRANSFORMER - 5G-TRANSFORMER: 5G Mobile Transport Platform for Verticals Abstract: The vision of the 5G-TRANSFORMER project is that Mobile Transport Networks shall transform from today’s rigid interconnection solutions into an SDN/NFV-based 5G Mobile Transport and Computing Platform (MTP) able of simultaneously supporting an extremely diverse range of networking and computing requirements to meet in particular the specific needs of vertical industries. A new networking paradigm known as Network Slicing has emerged for 5G as the most promising approach to address this challenge by enabling per slice management of virtualized resources. 5G-TRANSFORMER aims to bring the “Network Slicing” paradigm into mobile transport networks by provisioning and managing MTP slices tailored to the needs of vertical industries. Specifically: automotive, healthcare and media. The technical approach is twofold: (1) Enable Vertical Industries to meet their service requirements within customised MTP slices; and (2) Aggregate and Federate transport networking and computing fabric, from the edge up to the core and cloud, to create and manage MTP slices throughout a federated virtualized infrastructure. The proposed solution defines three novel building blocks that will be developed and demonstrated integrating the aforementioned three vertical industries:
(1) Vertical Slicer as the logical entry point (i.e., one stop shop) for verticals to support the creation of their respective transport slices in a short time-scale (in the order of minutes).
(2) Service Orchestrator to orchestrate the federation of transport networking and computing resources from multiple domains and manage their allocation to slices.
(3) Mobile Transport and Computing Platform as the underlying unified transport stratum for integrated fronthaul and backhaul networks.
The 5G-TRANSFORMER project addresses “ICT 07–2017: 5G PPP Research and Validation of critical technologies and systems” with a special focus on the TA11: Converged 5G FlexHaul Network objectives of the pre-structuring model.",1
"Title: 1D-Engine - 1D-electrons coupled to dissipation: a novel approach for understanding and engineering superconducting materials and devices Abstract: Correlated electrons are at the forefront of condensed matter theory. Interacting quasi-1D electrons have seen vast progress in analytical and numerical theory, and thus in fundamental understanding and quantitative prediction. Yet, in the 1D limit fluctuations preclude important technological use, particularly of superconductors. In contrast, high-Tc superconductors in 2D/3D are not precluded by fluctuations, but lack a fundamental theory, making prediction and engineering of their properties, a major goal in physics, very difficult. This project aims to combine the advantages of both areas by making major progress in the theory of quasi-1D electrons coupled to an electron bath, in part building on recent breakthroughs (with the PIs extensive involvement) in simulating 1D and 2D electrons with parallelized density matrix renormalization group (pDMRG) numerics. Such theory will fundamentally advance the study of open electron systems, and show how to use 1D materials as elements of new superconducting (SC) devices and materials: 1) It will enable a new state of matter, 1D electrons with true SC order. Fluctuations from the electronic liquid, such as graphene, could also enable nanoscale wires to appear SC at high temperatures. 2) A new approach for the deliberate engineering of a high-Tc superconductor. In 1D, how electrons pair by repulsive interactions is understood and can be predicted. Stabilization by reservoir - formed by a parallel array of many such 1D systems - offers a superconductor for which all factors setting Tc are known and can be optimized. 3) Many existing superconductors with repulsive electron pairing, all presently not understood, can be cast as 1D electrons coupled to a bath. Developing chain-DMFT theory based on pDMRG will allow these materials SC properties to be simulated and understood for the first time. 4) The insights gained will be translated to 2D superconductors to study how they could be enhanced by contact with electronic liquids.",0
"Title: ADENEAS - Advanced Data and power Electrical NEtwork Architectures and Systems Abstract: More Electric and Connected Aircraft (MECA) is one of the most promising enablers to reach Flightpath 2050. But MECA asks for more electrical systems, which exchange more data which can be safety critical, and consume more electrical power leading to higher thermal dissipation. This leads to complexity, weight penalty and increased exposure to intended (cybersecurity) and unintended (ElectroMagnetic Compatibility) interference. Overcoming these barriers requires an interdisciplinary cooperation and, in this context, the ADENEAS project emerged, aiming at paving the way for a safe, light, self-configuring, autonomous and modular power and data distribution network that is scalable to all aircraft sizes. To achieve this long-term objective, ADENEAS will define new architecture concepts, develop advanced Artificial Intelligence-based design tools, enabling technologies for intra-aircraft data communication and for power network and a cooling system. The project will also demonstrate the integration of the data and power network and cooling system, initiate standardisation activities and ensure commercial viability.
To achieve these objectives, ADENEAS will start from solid foundation of partner’s background, previous and ongoing R&D activities and will implement a stepwise approach from the definition of requirements and reference case (for small, medium and large aircraft) up to the assessment and evaluation of the developed, tested and demonstrated technologies. This includes strong involvement of an Industrial Advisory Board as well as standardisation perspective.
The ADENEAS future proof power and data network, scalable to all aircraft size, will support the Flightpath 2050 objective by allowing to save 0.7% block fuel burn and >156,000 kg of CO2 emitted per aircraft per year and secondary by optimizing maintenance and providing novel technologies to be deployed for increased passenger experience.",1
"Title: RELEVANCE - Regulation of red cell life-span, erythropoiesis, survival, senescence and clearance Abstract: Anaemia is the most common pathological condition affecting 1.6 billion individuals worldwide. It thus presents a serious health care problem and an economic burden. Reduction in red blood cell (RBC) number can be caused by blood loss, diet, stress conditions including endurance sport, and pathologies which are caused by primary genetic aberrations or are secondary to the malfunction of other cell types.  Transfusion of RBC, which is often the only cure for severe cases of anaemia, is associated with risks such as thrombosis and transfusion reactions due to allo-immunisation. There is an unmet need to improve treatment of anaemia through early and accurate diagnosis, targeted treatment, and increased safety and effectiveness of RBC transfusion. The aim of RELEVANCE is to improve fast and cost-effective diagnosis of the underlying cause of primary anaemia, and to improve treatment options for both general and personalised medicine. We defined five key objectives: (1) to improve diagnostics of anaemia, particularly for hereditary rare forms of anaemia (RA); (2) to find novel treatments for anaemia that target RBC production, ageing and clearance; (3) to reduce premature loss of RBC following transfusion; (4) to produce cultured RBC for transfusion; (5) to monitor and optimise RBC function during sport and exercise. RELEVANCE will train 15 early stage researchers (ESR) at four SMEs and eight academic partners, two of whom are at blood supply centres and two are diagnostic centres for RA. The continuous interactions between the clinic, blood supply centers, basic research, and industry will select for the most relevant unmet medical needs, and will stimulate innovative procedures that are immediately probed for applicability and validity both in a research and a clinical setting. RELEVANCE will organize three open access summer schools, extending training beyond the ESR of the ITN sustaining the critical number of young talented professionals in the field.",0
"Title: SeagateSail - 20% fuel saving for commercial vessels through a hybrid wind plus motor cruise mode. Abstract: Seagate is developing an innovative collapsible-automatic-retrofittable delta wing sail that can be applied to commercial vessels. Seagate Sail and cruise control aims to provide an adoptable and beneficial solution for commercial ship owners to reduce their fuel bills and cut emissions by 20%. The system is able to offer a solution to both problems whilst at the same time being suited to the needs of commercial ships, which makes the solution unique and highly desirable.  The Seagate Sail, installed on the vessel’s deck, will convert wind into driving force.  The Seagate Cruise Control will convert the driving force into fuel saving, by proportionally reducing the engine power. With the Seagate solution, the vessel will cruise at the original speed (and therefore keep to the Estimated Time of Arrival) using 20% less fuel.
The solution is at a mature stage of development and therefore the feasibility assessment will focus on the development of the industrial chain to set-up and validate the scale-up production of Seagate Sail, a sound IP management strategy, solid financial projections and the sale agreements for the commercialisation. The sails will be developed in Europe involving different industrial partners, managed by a British and Italian team. Once commercialised, Seagate will maintain its headquarters and manufacturing activities in Europe offering new job opportunities across the continent. Seagate aims to set a commercial partnership with a top European engine supplier to speed up the commercial growth of its products in Europe and Worldwide.",0
"Title: NeuPheMi - Neurophenomenology of Mental Imagery Abstract: The NeuPheMi project presents a novel approach in the neuroscientific study of mental imagery. Mechanisms of mental imagery are not yet well understood and while traditional approaches investigated their neural correlates based mostly on problem-solving tasks, NeuPheMi proposes to shed the light on the neural correlates of experiencing mental imagery. By taking into account the subjective experience and using electroencephalography and brain stimulation techniques to investigate the dynamic of neuronal activity during mental imagery in an original neurophenomenological approach, NeuPheMi is expected to bring a better understanding of the neuronal basis of mental imagery and extend our comprehension of human consciousness. 
Conjointly investigating the subjective experience and cerebral activity during mental imagery is a considerable research challenge, with tremendous benefits to both applied and basic science – directly in line with the European research priorities, as underlined in the Horizon2020 Future and Emerging Technologies initiative Knowing, doing and being: cognition beyond problem solving.",0
"Title: ZapGoCharger - Rapid charging of cordless appliances using graphene-based supercapacitors Abstract: Zap&Go has developed a fast charging solution to appliances, devices and vehicles. In contrast to Lithium-ion batteries, the dominant solution in these markets today, Zap&Go’s supercapacitors charge in 5 minutes or less and are proven to be safe to handle without fire risk. Zap&Go has raised 2m EUR in seed funding in 2015 and a ~7m EUR Round A in 2016 from private investors to invest in its pilot production line. 

The IP was partly developed at Oxford University, exclusively licensed to Zap&Go and is now being advanced by in-house scientists. Zap&Go is expanding its patent portfolio to secure a sustainable competitive advantage in the markets it is addressing. Core to the technology is the use of carbon nano-materials, including graphene that allow the design of rechargeable pouches or flat cells. 

In this Phase II project Zap&Go will develop 1) supercapacitor power modules and electronics specifically integrating with cordless tools such as cordless vacuum cleaners and power drills and 2) build trial units to conduct customer trials. At the end of the project Zap&Go expects to have at least one pre-contract signed with a European high volume manufacturer. In Phase III, Zap&Go will aim to become the leading supplier to the cordless appliance market before entering other global markets such as electric scooters and autonomous passenger transportation vehicles. 

In its self-funded Phase I feasibility study Zap&Go established consumers’ willingness via a crowdfunding campaign, pre-selling 1,200 units.

"Title: QCALL - Quantum Communications for ALL Abstract: Quantum Communications for ALL (QCALL) endeavors to take the next necessary steps to bring the developing quantum
technologies closer to the doorsteps of end users. Quantum communications (QC) is well-known for its offering ultra-secure
cryptographic key-exchange schemes—resilient to any future technological advancement. QCALL will empower a nucleus of
researchers in this area to provide secure communications in our continent and, in the long run, to our connections
worldwide. With the large scale violations of privacy in the EU exchange of information, this is a crucial moment to pursue
this objective. By covering a range of projects, with short, mid, and long-term visions, and using a balanced and multifaceted
training programme, QCALL trains a cadre of highly qualified interdisciplinary workforce capable of shaping the R&D section
of the field, hence accelerating its widespread adoption. This will ensure that EU will remain at the frontier of research on
secure communications and advanced QC systems and devices. In QCALL, we explore the challenges of integrating
quantum and classical communication networks; this will be essential in providing cost-efficient services. We experimentally
examine and theoretically study new protocols by which network users can exchange secure keys with each other. We
investigate disruptive technologies that enable wireless access to such quantum networks, and develop new
devices and protocols that enable multi-party QC. Our meticulously planned training programme includes components from
shared taught courses through to scientific schools and complementary-skill workshops, supplemented by secondment
opportunities and innovative outreach and dissemination activities. This will create a structured model for doctoral training in
EU that will last beyond the life of the project, so will the industry-academic collaborations that are essential to the
development of the disruptive technologies that will make QC available to ALL.",1
"Title: OCRE - Access to Commercial Services Through the EOSC-hub Abstract: The Open Cloud for Research Environments consortium combines the expertise of four partners to enable access and drive the adoption and use of commercial digital services by the European research community. Essential for interdisciplinary research, these services include:
• Commodity type commercial digital services, such as: 
     •	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), providing compute, storage, network and related services, and a 
        platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications as a public cloud service. 
     •	Software as a Service (SaaS), an on-demand software licensing and delivery model in which software is used by the customer on a 
        subscription basis and is hosted by the supplier as a public cloud service. File storage (sync and share), online collaboration, 
        simulation and virtualisation tools are example services.

• Secure Earth Observation commercial services, which make use of the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS).

After gathering user requirements, the OCRE will manage the adoption funds and buy resources from the selected suppliers (OCRE will act as customer) and make cloud resources available to institutions. Such a delivery vehicle is effective and efficient for the supply as well as the demand side.

Service adoption is the key focus of this work. A legal and technical mechanism (The OCRE Business Management Platform) will be created to integrate a range of these commercial services into the EOSC hub in order to make them more easily available to researchers.",1
"Title: NoLiMiTs - Novel Lifesaving Magnetic Tentacles Abstract: The aim of this project is to characterize fundamental principles at the intersection of robotics, magnetics, manufacturing and medicine, which will enable intelligent tentacle-like robots to augment the capabilities of surgeons in reaching deep into the human anatomy through complex winding pathways and treat inoperable diseases.
Magnetic tentacle robots, proposed here for the first time, have the potential to be thin, extremely soft and scalable, and to conform to curvilinear trajectories by leveraging magnetic control over their entire length. The surgeon needing to access difficult to reach targets such as peripheral nodules in the lungs, small diseased blood vessels and regions deep inside the brain, will be able to design personalised tentacles and fabricate them on demand.
My world-leading research team in surgical robotics–to be further consolidated by this grant–will define and explore new robotic architectures, as well as the design and fabrication processes integral to this novel concept. Proprioceptive sensing, combined with mathematical models, will enable intelligent robotic control. Robotic assistance will be context dependent, ranging from joystick-based operation to autonomous control along pre-planned trajectories. An integrated design environment will help systematise and streamline implementation.
The research programme consists of four work packages: 1) Robotic architectures and models; 2) Intelligence and control; 3) Rapid design, simulation and synthesis; and 4) Multi-scale experimental evaluation, embracing different scenarios where control over the entire body of the robot is crucial: lung biopsy, cardiovascular interventions and neurosurgery.
This interdisciplinary research will strengthen Europe’s position in medical robotics and improve public health by reducing patient recovery times, complication rates, and treatment costs, and ultimately saving the lives of patients suffering diseases that are inoperable—and often terminal—today.",0
"Title: Wi-5 - What to do With the Wi-Fi Wild West Abstract: The last few years have witnessed a significant increase in the use of portable devices, especially smartphones and tablets thanks to their functionality, user-friendly interface, and affordable price. Most of these devices use Wi-Fi Access Points (AP) where possible, in addition to 3G/4G, to connect to the Internet due to its speed, maturity and efficiency. 

Given this demand, Wi-Fi is facing mounting issues of spectrum efficiency due to its utilisation of non-licensed frequency bands, so improvements continue to be added to standards in order to improve performance and adapt it to new demands. For example, as Wi-Fi saturation increases in areas, such as business centres, malls, campuses or even whole European cities, interference between these competing APs can begin to negatively impact users’ experience. At the same time, real-time interactive services have grown in popularity and are now used across a range of mobile devices. These share the same connection with “traditional” applications, such as e-mail and Web browsing, but are far more bandwidth intensive and require consistent network capacity to meet user Quality of Experience demands. 

In this context, Wi-5 Project (What to do With the Wi-Fi Wild West) proposes an architecture based on an integrated and coordinated set of smart solutions able to efficiently reduce interference between neighbouring APs and provide optimised connectivity for new and emerging services. Cooperating mechanisms will be integrated into Wi-Fi equipment at different layers of the protocol stack with the aim of meeting a demanding set of goals:

• Support seamless hand-over to improve user experience with real-time interactive services
• Develop new business models to optimise available Wi-Fi spectrum in urban areas, public spaces, and offices
• Integrate novel smart functionalities into APs to address radio spectrum congestion and current usage inefficiency, thus increasing global throughput and achieving energy savings",1
"Title: DynAMic - Dynamic adaptive microscopy for label-free multi-parametric imaging in biology and medicine Abstract: Optical microscopy constitutes one of the most fundamental paradigms in biological and medical imaging. However, significant challenges remain in regard to the application of optical microscopy to in vivo interrogations. First, the diffusing nature of light propagation in tissue due to random variations of the refractive index, limits in vivo microscopy to superficial depths; within only a few mean free paths (<1mm). Second the invasive nature of fluorescent proteins and probes, allows monitoring of only 1-5 events by spectrally multiplexing different fluorochromes; i.e. performance that is highly incompatible with the targets of functional genomics and proteomics.
This proposal aims to develop the next step in optical visualization by addressing these two fundamental limitations of optical imaging, i.e. Depth and Contrast. To achieve this, DynAMic proposes a radically new concept for optical imaging of tissue based on ❶ developing real-time wavefront-shaping adaptive optics for making the performance of any optical system ideal and for the first time in Raman microscopy ❷ reaching tenfold deeper in tissue than conventional optical microscopy by compensating for the refractive index variations using  phase and polarization retrieval for inversing light diffusion and ❸ utilize advance image formation to improve the sensitivity and utilization of stimulated Raman scattering for multi-parametric label-free contrast that radically expands at least tenfold the number of labels concurrently retrieved from living systems, linking optical observation to functional proteomic requirements. 
The new optical imaging ability delivered in DynAMic will be applied to a first target application of ophthalmic imaging, also used as a window to the brain and devastating nervous disease detection, defining the next generation ophthalmology and neurology sensing, disrupting the modus operandi of retinal imaging  without disturbing the modus agendi of the end users.",0
"Title: WhoLoDancE - Whole-Body Interaction Learning for Dance Education Abstract: Whole-Body Interaction Learning for Dance Education

WhoLoDance will create and deliver the proof-of-concept of a motion capture repository of dance motions built in a method allowing interpolations, extrapolations and synthesis through similarity search to enable new and powerful dance teaching paradigms. 

Finally WhoLoDance aim is to create a digital environment that will provide dance educators and students, as well as creators (choreographers) the opportunity for capacity building and networking, bringing together practitioners from different physical spaces, and will allow them to communicate chorographical ideas and movement concepts online and work collaboratively.",0
"Title: BEACON - Hybrid Digital-Analog Networking under Extreme Energy and Latency Constraints Abstract: The objective of the BEACON project is to (re-)introduce analog communications into the design of modern wireless networks. We argue that the extreme energy and latency constraints imposed by the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm can only be met within a hybrid digital-analog communications framework. Current network architectures separate source and channel coding, orthogonalize users, and employ long block-length digital source and channel codes, which are either suboptimal or not applicable under the aforementioned constraints. BEACON questions these well-established design principles, and proposes to replace them with a hybrid digital-analog communications framework, which will meet the required energy and latency constraints while simplifying the encoding and decoding processes. BEACON pushes the performance of the IoE to its theoretical limits by i) exploiting signal correlations that are abundant in IoE applications, given the foreseen density of deployed sensing devices, ii) taking into account the limited and stochastic nature of energy availability due to, for example, energy harvesting capabilities, iii) using feedback resources to improve the end-to-end signal distortion, and iv) deriving novel converse results to identify fundamental performance benchmarks.

The results of BEACON will not only shed light on the fundamental limits on the performance any coding scheme can achieve, but will also lead to the development of unconventional codes and communication protocols that can approach these limits, combining digital and analog communication techniques. The ultimate challenge for this project is to exploit the developed hybrid digital-analog networking theory for a complete overhaul of the physical layer design for emerging IoE applications, such as smart grids, tele-robotics and smart homes. For this purpose, a proof-of-concept implementation test-bed will also be built using software defined radios and sensor nodes.",1
"Title: ExPaNDS - EOSC Photon and Neutron Data Services Abstract: The ambition of EOSC Photon and Neutron Data Services (ExPaNDS) is to enrich the EOSC with data management services and to coordinate activities to enable national Photon and Neutron (PaN) RIs to make the majority of their data ‘open’ following FAIR principles and to harmonise their efforts to make their data catalogues and data analysis services accessible through the EOSC, thereby enabling them to be shared in a uniform way.
EOSC currently provides a range of services that needs to be adapted to the ever-increasing requirements of scientific experiments held at various PaN RIs. It is essential that these services become standardised, interoperable and integrated to fully exploit the scientific opportunities at PaN RIs.
ExPaNDS therefore seeks to: Enable EOSC services and to provide coherent FAIR data services to the scientific users of PaN RIs; connect PaN RIs through a platform of data catalogues and analysis services through the EOSC for users from RIs, universities, industry etc.; gather feedback and cooperate with the EOSC governance bodies to improve the EOSC and develop standard relationships and interconnections between scientific publications, PaN scientific datasets, experimental reports, instruments and authors (via ORCID).
Concretely ExPaNDS proposes to standardise and link all the relevant PaN RI catalogues to ensure that the user community has access to both the raw data they collect, which is linked to their research session at the various national RIs, and relevant peer review articles produced as a direct result of their usage. It is paramount that we develop a common ontology to fully integrate all the elements of the catalogues as well as a roadmap for the back-end architecture and functionalities. We also propose to develop a powerful taxonomy strategy in line with the requirement of the EOSC user community. The proposed activity will feed into the OpenAIRE infrastructure integrating and linking entities from a wide range of scholarly resources.",0
"Title: MONICA - Management Of Networked IoT Wearables – Very Large Scale Demonstration of Cultural  Societal Applications Abstract: The SoundCity Project MONICA aims to provide a very large scale demonstration of multiple existing and new Internet of Things technologies for Smarter Living. The solution will be deployed in 6 major cities in Europe.
MONICA demonstrates a large scale IoT ecosystem  that uses innovative wearable and portable IoT sensors and actuators with closed-loop back-end services integrated into an interoperable, cloud-based platform capable of offering a multitude of simultaneous, targeted applications.
All ecosystems will be demonstrated in the scope of large scale city events, but have general applicability for dynamically deploying Smart City applications in many fixed locations such as airports, main traffic arterials, and construction sites. Moreover, it is inherent in the MONICA approach to identify the official standardisation potential areas in all stages of the project.
MONICA will demonstrate an IoT platform in massive scale operating conditions; capable of handling at least 10.000 simultaneous real end-users with wearable and portable sensors using existing and emerging technologies (TRL 5-6) and based upon open standards and architectures. 
It will design, develop and deploy a platform capable of integrating large amounts of heterogeneous, interoperable IoT enabled sensors with different data capabilities (video, audio, data), resource constraints (wearables, Smartphones, Smartwatches), bandwidth (UWB, M2M), costs (professional, consumer), and deployment (wearable, mobile, fixed, airborne) as well as actuators (lights, LED, cameras, alarms, drones, loudspeakers).
It will demo end-to-end, closed loop solutions covering everything from devices and middleware with semantic annotations through a multitude of wireless communication channels to cloud based applications and back to actuation networks. Humans-in-the-Loop is demonstrated through integrating Situational Awareness and Decision Support tools for organisers, security staff and sound engineers situation rooms.",1
"Title: IMPACT - Impact of Cultural aspects in the management of emergencies in public Transport Abstract: The objective of the IMPACT project is to investigate the essential role played by cultural factors in managing safety- and security-issues related to emergencies in public transport systems.
The IMPACT Coordination and Supporting Action is aimed at analysing the different cultural behaviours for the prevention of emergencies  with particular emphasis on risk and situational awareness perception of the different cultural groups; information to passengers with different socio-cultural backgrounds; cooperation towards prevention of security threats; security checks.

"Title: ELIOT - Enhance Lighting for the Internet of Things Abstract: So far, the Internet of Things (IoT) is narrowband with no latency constraints. A wider range of applications is envisioned for industrial manufacturing, augmented reality and autonomous cars. It makes use of artificial intelligence, where compute functions will be offloaded from devices into the cloud. Accordingly, future IoT will need wireless links with high data rates, low latency and reliable connectivity despite the limited radio spectrum. Connected lighting is an interesting infrastructure for IoT services because it enables visible light communication (VLC), i.e. a wireless communication using unlicensed light spectrum. LED luminaires have enough modulation bandwidth for high data rates and each luminaire can be used as a wireless access point. Networked VLC-enhanced luminaires will add new features to build a wireless network for the IoT. ELIOT will start from existing prototypes and develop the support for IoT services. The project will integrate the lighting infrastructure with VLC and add positioning, multicast communications and enhanced security. ELIOT will demonstrate the new infrastructure in real environments at TRL ≥6 and mobile IoT devices at TRL ≥ 4. Main project goals are to provide an open reference architecture for the support of IoT in the lighting infrastructure, build consensus reflecting the best architectural choices, contribute to standardization of lighting and telecom infrastructures in IEC, IETF, IEEE and ITU-T and provide a roadmap for IoT until 2022 and beyond. ELIOT brings together Europe’s key players that cover the whole value chain, i.e. OSRAM, Philips Lighting and Tridonic as major component and luminaire makers, Maxlinear as chipmaker, NOKIA as a leading network vendor and integrator, BMW, Weidmüller and Thyssen Krupp working on industrial IoT, Deutsche Telekom and KPN as innovative operators, together with Fraunhofer HHI as a leading research institute and two top universities from Eindhoven and Oxford.",1
"Title: EXFILES - Extract Forensic Information for LEAs from Encrypted SmartPhones Abstract: ""Technological advances and development of sophisticated functions in mobile devices led to new usages and dependencies. Mobile phones are often a key factor in criminal cases, intrusions, intellectual property theft, security threats, and more. The data stored in these devices may contain critical evidence associated with the above-mentioned crimes. 
The latest generation of devices incorporate new security features and encryption schemes to """"protect"""" the device and its associated user data. The other side of the coin is that the rapid processing of critical evidence by various information retrieval techniques is slowed down, if not made impossible. The mobile device forensics field is a challenging area for forensic analysts, particularly given the increasing number of data encryption mechanisms.
The EXFILES project aims to provide law enforcement agencies (LEAs) with new tools to extract data and associated evidence from these devices in strict legal contexts. A unique consortium of five LEAs, universities and cyber security companies from the EU have joined forces to address these challenges. Together, they defined three areas of work on technical data extraction techniques, namely software exploitation, hardware methods and combined methods. In addition, tools and methods inspired by other areas of information security (e.g. security assessments based on common criteria) will lead to new judicial methods of accessing data for lawful investigations. Another unique dimension of EXFILES is the clear focus on the ethical and legal aspects of research and exploitation as well as dissemination and training activities for the next generation of forensic experts.
The main objective of EXFILES project is to improve Law Enforcement Agencies techniques and methods, to extract digital evidence from modern encrypted smartphones used by criminals based on holistic approach (both software and hardware).

"Title: HyStorIES - Hydrogen Storage In European Subsurface Abstract: Renewable hydrogen combined with large scale underground storage enables transportation of energy through time, balancing out the impacts of variable renewable energy production. While storing pure hydrogen in salt caverns has been practiced since the 70s in Europe, it has never been carried out anywhere in depleted fields or aquifers.

Technical developments are needed to validate these two solutions. As subsurface technical feasibility studies for a future hydrogen storage in depleted field or aquifer will be site-specific, as for other geology related activities, HyStories will provide developments applicable to a wide range of  possible future sites: the addition of H2-storage relevant characteristics in reservoir databases at European scale; reservoir and geochemical modelling for cases representative of European subsurface, and tests of this representativeness by comparing it with results obtained with real storage sites models; and lastly an extensive sampling and microbiological lab experiment programme to cover a variety of possible conditions.

Complementarily, techno-economic feasibility studies will provide insights into underground hydrogen storage for decision makers in government and industry. Modelling of the European energy system will first define the demand for hydrogen storage. Environmental and Societal impact studies will be developed. For a given location and hydrogen storage demand, a high-level cost assessment for development of each of the competing geological storage options at that location will be estimated, and the sites will be ranked based on techno-economic criteria developed within the project. Finally, several case studies will enable consideration of the implementation of potential projects, notably by considering their economic interest.

This will provide substantial insight into the suitability for implementing such storage across EU and enable the proposition of an implementation plan.",0
"Title: ReadingMachine - Molecular machine for information reading and catalysis Abstract: The conversion of chemical energy into translational and rotational movement at the molecular level enables biological motors to perform and control a wide variety of complex functions. ‘Read-out’ tasks are essential for life as these processes can translate information from DNA to RNA and from RNA to encode proteins. 
The ‘ReadingMachine’ project aims to design, construct and investigate chemically fuelled linear molecular machines capable of active transport of cargo, the read-out information and other sophisticated tasks. Specifically, I will develop [2]rotaxane-based molecular machines for information storage and read-out. I will first investigate the rational design of an orthogonal gating system on the track to allow for the unidirectional transportation of a macrocycle through the track by fuelled acid-base oscillations. By recognition of the chiral information of each station it docks at, the macrocycle will be able to report its position through a unique CD signal output. Harnessing the unidirectional motion of the macrocycle on the track, sequential information of the track will be non-destructive read-out by a series of CD outputs. Furthermore, the information that the macrocycle is reading will change the conformation of the macrocycle. As a result, the reading process will enable the molecular machine to be a 'smart' catalyst for enantioselective synthesis according to the signal it reads. 
The controlled information storage and read-out process on molecular-level through a fuelled non-destructive reading machine is a tremendous challenge that could lead us towards the dawn of an era of useful molecular nanotechnology, for example ‘re-storage’ and ‘replication’ of stored information, and ultimately point the way for the use of such molecular machines to write (i.e. synthesize) sequence information as it is reading from the track.",0
"Title: WAVECOMBE - mmWave Communications in the Built Environments Abstract: The foreseen exponential growth of mobile data traffic will not be uniform across geographical areas, but is mainly concentrated in hot spots that are usually located in the built environments (BEs) such as central business districts, stations, airports, stadiums, dense urban environments, etc. This poses considerable challenges that we believe can be solved by ultra dense deployment of millimetre-wave (mmW) small-cells (SCs) in conjunction with massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) in 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks. However, there are a number of research challenges that need to be addressed for a successful deployment of 5G/B5G wireless networks: even if the theoretical background of massive MIMO is by now rather complete, the actual performance characterization and measurements of mmW antenna arrays has not yet been fully addressed at either the component or system level; mmW radio channel measurements have
been performed but with limited time delay resolution, single antennas and over single radio links; and mmW bands have been considered for mobile communications, but the level of detail and diversity of BEs necessary for meaningful mmW SC deployment has not been fully exploited. Therefore, we propose here a research approach that combines the three disruptive key enabling technologies for 5G/B5G with the aim to answer fundamental questions that are still not well understood. 

Hence, the research objectives of the project are as follows: 
• Develop and test mmW MIMO and massive MIMO antennas.
• Characterize and model radio propagation channel at mmW bands for typical BEs (offices, homes, stations, airports).
• Theoretically analyse and optimise massive MIMO mmW SC performance in the BEs.
• Integrate massive MIMO mmW SC networks with their operating environments.
• Develop methods to retrofit existing buildings and to design new buildings for efficient high-capacity wireless communications in the BEs.",1

The objective will be to strengthen connectivity to Latin America ensuring very high capacity, cost benefits and the shortest possible route, whilst stimulating diversity over the transatlantic segment. The objective will be met in two phases: phase one will procure an indefeasible right of use for a portion of the spectrum of a direct submarine telecommunications cable between Europe and Latin America; phase two will deploy one or more wavelengths, as required, on the spectrum procured to interconnect the GÉANT and RedCLARA networks, and provide for the intercontinental connectivity needs of the European and Latin American research and education communities.",1
"Title: MAGicSky - Magnetic Skyrmions for Future Nanospintronic Devices Abstract: Challenges facing technology for power efficient, high density, high speed information processing and storage are well recognised, and strategies for meeting them in the short term define the shape of industry roadmaps. As a consequence, in the next ten years, radically new approaches will be implemented and will transform how data is stored and manipulated. Skyrmion-based devices are newcomers to this global race for the next generations of information technology. Skyrmions were discovered in magnetic crystals only a few years ago, but we already have within reach a possibility to create them in nanoscale devices that can be made compatible with conventional integrated circuit technology. Our work in MAGicSky will substantiate this possibility.
The potential benefits are enormous. Skyrmions are magnetic solitons that carry information, and are remarkably robust against defects that can trap or destroy them due to the topology of their magnetic texture. Topology also appears to further underlie other of their technologically important features: mobility with small continuous currents and singular dynamics under radio-frequency. MAGicSky will engage some of the most advanced materials fabrication, characterisation and microscopic imaging facilities in Europe together with leading theoretical and computational modelling capabilities, to create the first proof-of-concept room temperature spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions.",1
"Title: SCAVENGE - Sustainable CellulAr networks harVEstiNG ambient Energy Abstract: Energy sustainability is key to future mobile networks due to their foreseen capacity upsurge. The objective of the ETN SCAVENGE (Sustainable CellulAr networks harVEstiNG ambient Energy) is to create a training network for early-stage
researchers (ESRs) who will contribute to the design and implementation of eco-friendly and sustainable next-generation (5G) networks and become leaders in the related scientific, technological, and industrial initiatives. Sustainable networks are
based on the premise that environmental energy can be scavenged through dedicated harvesting hardware so as to power 5G base stations (BSs) and the end devices (mobile terminals, sensors and machines). To realise this vision, the project will take a complete approach, encompassing the characterisation of intermittent and/or erratic energy sources, the development of theoretical models, and the design, optimisation and proof-of-concept implementation of core network, BS and mobile elements as well as their integration with the smart electrical grid. 
The consortium is composed of world-class research centres and companies that are in the forefront of mobile communication and renewable energy research and technology development. The attitude of the industrial partners towards the strong investment in R&D and their strategic vision are fully aligned with the mission of this project, making them perfectly fit for this consortium. This grants a well-balanced project with genuine and strong technical interactions. The ESRs will have a unique opportunity towards professional growth in light of dedicated cross-partner training activities and through the interaction with the Partner Organisations, which also include relevant stakeholders in the envisioned market. All of this will ensure that the trained researchers will be successfully employed at the end of the research program.",1
"Title: WISDOM - The autonomous floral pathway: a WIndow to Study the tight link between non-coDing RNA and chrOMatin regulation Abstract: My Fellowship will explore the interconnection between non-coding RNA and chromatin regulation. Building on a detailed mechanistic base, I will capitalize on the recent proteomic identification of a stable complex FLD/SDG26 by my host lab, which plays a central role in the co-transcriptional silencing of the Arabidopsis floral repressor locus FLC. This protein complex is central to a mechanism determining the quantitative expression level of FLC, and thus the reproductive strategy of the plant. However, these activities also regulate many other targets in the Arabidopsis genome and the conserved nature of the components suggests the deeper understanding gained from this study will be important generally across all eukaryotes. FLD is a histone demethylase with specificity for H3K4; SDG26 is a SET domain protein likely to methylate histones and other proteins, but whose specificity is currently unknown. The splicing and alternative processing of FLC antisense non-coding transcript, COOLAIR, is essential for the repression of FLC transcription. However, how the processing of COOLAIR controls sense transcription remains elusive. My proposal aims to: 1) test the hypothesis that the FLD/SDG26 complex, triggered by FCA/FY-mediated proximal polyadenylation of COOLAIR, delivers a specific chromatin environment, which represses transcriptional output: and 2) explore the missing link between FCA/FY-mediated proximal polyadenylation of COOLAIR and chromatin regulation by FLD/SDG26 complex. My proposal involves interconnections between genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology, enabling me to develop a broader experimental skillset. It directly contributes to the action’s goals to: improve my creative potential and competences through international mobility and advanced training in technical and transferable skills; enhance collaborative and contact networks for both myself and my host lab through academic and public engagement; and drive substantial career development.",0
"Title: EuroCirCol - European Circular Energy-Frontier Collider Study Abstract: The award of the 2013 Nobel Prize for Physics acknowledged the leading role of Europe in particle physics, which has a global community of over 10,000 scientists. To reinforce its pole position throughout the 21st century, Europe must be ready to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project by 2018/19. This is one of the main recommendations of the updated European Strategy for Particle Physics, adopted by the CERN Council in May 2013.
The EuroCirCol conceptual design study is a direct response to this recommendation, initiating a study for a 100 TeV energy-frontier circular collider through a collaboration of institutes and universities worldwide.

A new research infrastructure of such scale depends on the feasibility of key technologies pushed beyond current state of the art. Innovative designs for accelerator magnets to achieve high-quality fields up to 16 T and for a cryogenic beam vacuum system to cope with unprecedented synchrotron light power are required. The effects of colliding two 50 TeV beams must be mastered to meet the physics research requirements. Advanced energy efficiency, reliability and cost effectiveness are key factors to build and operate such an accelerator within realistic time scale and cost.

This proposal is part of the Future Circular Collider study under European leadership, federating resources worldwide to assess the merits of different post-LHC accelerator scenarios. It forms the core of a globally coordinated strategy of converging activities, involving participants from the ERA and beyond. Organisations joining this study from Japan and the USA are expected to take part in a global implementation project and a suitable governance model will be drawn-up accordingly.

The main outcome of EuroCirCol will be laying the foundation of subsequent infrastructure development actions that will strengthen the ERA as a focal point of global research cooperation and as a leader in frontier knowledge and technologies over the next decades.",0
"Title: iNEXT-Discovery - Infrastructure for transnational access and discovery in structural biology Abstract: Structural biology reveals the molecular architecture of life; the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules and how they interact to form complex machineries and cells. Structural biology is key to innovations in chemistry, biotechnology and medicine: new drugs, advanced vaccines, novel biomaterials, engineered enzymes for food production, a cleaner environment, and efficient biofuels. iNEXT-Discovery takes on the challenge of proactively supporting the uptake of existing tools, and the innovation of new tools, to promote scientific Discovery and translation in a range of disciplines, building on the success of the H2020 project iNEXT (infrastructure for NMR, EM and X-rays for Translational research).

iNEXT-Discovery brings together a strong network of leading structural biology facilities in partnership with regional experts and ESFRI communities in medicinal chemistry, translational medicine, biological imaging, and food research, to disseminate knowledge and services. We aim to stimulate the wider uptake of structural biology across Europe, across scientific disciplines and research sectors. Significant hardware and software advances allow targeting transnational access to advanced instrumentation also to scientists without previous expertise in structural biology: uptake will be facilitated by training and thematic calls focused on new communities.

All our activities support innovative research of both academic and industrial users.",0
"Title: MUSMICRO - Causes and consequences of variation in the mammalian microbiota Abstract: The mammalian gut teems with a particularly dense and diverse microbial community, the composition of which varies widely among hosts. A large body of laboratory work suggests these communities provide important functions for the host – including nutrition, pathogen protection and immune development – but we know very little about what shapes the mammalian gut microbiota, and how it affects the host, in natural populations. 
A major barrier to progress is a lack of powerful investigative tools for most wild animal species. I will overcome this by studying a natural population of the species that has the best laboratory tools, and knowledge, for the mammalian microbiome: the house mouse. Specifically, I will set up a new wild house mouse system and use it to address three broad questions: 1) what drives natural variation in the gut microbiota? 2) does microbiota variation predict fitness traits in the wild? and, critically, 3) does microbiota variation causally affect fitness-relevant traits? To do this, I will pair detailed, longitudinal studies of wild mice with controlled experiments in the lab, making use of state-of-the-art tools for this species, including: (i) faecal transplant experiments with germ-free animals, to test the phenotypic impact of different wild mouse microbiotas (ii) high resolution genotyping methods and (iii) new radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology we have recently developed for monitoring wild rodent survival and behaviour.
By doing so, this project will directly tackle the key unanswered question: does the composition of the mammalian gut microbiota actually matter in nature?",1
"Title: 5G-DIVE - 5G-DIVE: eDge Intelligence for Vertical Experimentation Abstract: Abstract: 5G-DIVE targets end-to-end 5G trials aimed at proving the technical merits and business value proposition of 5G technologies in two vertical pilots, namely (i) Industry 4.0 and (ii) Autonomous Drone Scout. These trials will put in action a bespoke end-to-end 5G design tailored to the requirements of the applications targeted in each vertical pilot, such as digital twinning and drone fleet navigation applications. 5G-DIVE’s bespoke design is built around two main pillars, namely (1) end-to-end 5G connectivity including 5G New Radio, Crosshaul transport and 5G Core, and (2) distributed edge and fog computing integrating intelligence located closely to the user. The latter pillar extends significantly beyond the EU- TW-Phase-I 5G-CORAL solution framework by adding support for automation based on artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technologies. The targeted intelligent tailored design is envisioned to achieve optimized performance and thus boost significantly the business value proposition of 5G in each targeted vertical application. 5G-DIVE trials target pilots running for several weeks on the premises of the vertical applications in real-life testbeds in Europe and Taiwan, leveraging noticeably the European 5G end- to-end facilities from ICT-17 call and Taiwan’s testbed facilities.",1
"Title: DIOR - DIOR: Deep Intelligent Optical and Radio  Communication Networks Abstract: Communication networks play a vital role in the technological infrastructure underpinning Internet traffic applications. Service providers and researchers worldwide are sparing no effort to increase the information capacity and security of telecommunication networks to support the demands of high-speed, reliable and secure emerging internet, data centre, cloud computing, 5G new radio and IoT systems, especially since the outbreak of Coronavirus. Applications such as intelligent transportation, signal processing ubiquitous low-latency connectivity and massive connected objects, have raised challenges for backbone and access networks that are often underpinned by optical, radio or hybrid networks. Artificial intelligent (AI) technologies appear an innovative and promising solution to cope with emerging challenges in optical/wireless/hybrid networks, in which the underlying physics, mathematics and optimisation of problems are non-deterministic to analyse or impossible to describe explicitly. In this proposed research, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques such as neural networks, clustering and regression will be exploited in optical/wireless/hybrid networks to mitigate stochastic distortions, to predict network conditions and to maximise network capacity. This DIOR proposal aims to unite optical/radio network research and AI technologies for tackling emerging challenges. This project aims to carry out world-leading research on building a machine learning-based communication platform to accelerate secure, intelligent and high-capacity communication networks.",1
"Title: 5G-PICTURE - 5G Programmable Infrastructure Converging disaggregated neTwork and compUte REsources Abstract: The explosive growth of mobile internet traffic introduces the need to transform traditional closed, static and inelastic network infrastructures into open, scalable and elastic ecosystems supporting new types of connectivity, high mobility and new mission-critical services for operators, vendors and vertical industries.
5G-PICTURE will develop and demonstrate a converged fronthaul and backhaul infrastructure integrating advanced wireless and novel optical network solutions. Τo address the limitations of the current D-RAN and C-RAN approaches, 5G-PICTURE will exploit flexible functional splits that can be dynamically selected, to optimise resource and energy efficiency.
This results in a paradigm shift, from RAN and C-RAN to ʽDis-Aggregated RANʼ (DA-RAN). DA-RAN is a novel concept where HW and SW components are disaggregated across the wireless, optical and compute/storage domains. ʽResource disaggregationʼ allows decoupling these components, creating a common “pool of resources” that can be independently selected and allocated on demand to compose any infrastructure service. Key enablers for DA-RAN are 1) network ʽsoftwarizationʼ, migrating from the conventional closed networking model to an open reference platform, supported through 2) HW programmability, where HW is configured directly by network functions, to provide the required performance. This will enable provisioning of any service by flexibly mixing-and-matching network, compute and storage resources without sacrificing performance and efficiency as is the case in today’s NFV-based solutions.
To validate these capabilities, 5G-PICTURE will demonstrate converged fronthaul and backhaul services in: a) a smart city environment, b) a 5G railway experimental testbed showcasing seamless service provisioning and mobility management in high-speed moving environments and c) a stadium with ultra-high user density, supporting media services.
The project results will be widely promoted for adoption and standardization",1
"Title: ALC - Aircraft Light Communication Abstract: The ambition of ALC is to show evidence that LiFi connection solutions can successfully address current RF transmission drawbacks and are mature enough to successfully operate connected devices in the highly demanding environment of a cockpit. The targeted breakthroughs to be reached are:
- Interfacing an existing LiFi module to the aircraft server
- Implementing the currently existing secure and robust LiFi connection used for offices into the severe environmental conditions of an aircraft
- Reducing current consumption of the connected devices, to save battery and increase autonomy.

As compared to currently implemented solutions (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth), ALC will demonstrate that LiFi is:
- Fully secure for data transmission with no possible threat of malevolent action
- Fully reliable with no risk of interference or propagation effects, fully compliant with normal conditions (e.g. sun or artificial lights, obstacles) and abnormal conditions (e.g. smoke) as well as  DO160-G compliant for power management 

The project will therefore deliver, test and validate up to TRL5 applications integrating LiFi communication with: 
1/ A flight crew wireless audio headset integrating LiFi connection
2/ An EFB tablet integrating LiFi connection to the A/C
3/ A connected headset, gathering health monitoring and behaviour/motion signals
4/ One or several other LiFi applications, to be identified by FACTEM, PURELIFI and XLIM, replacing existing wired connections, or providing new services or functions

For each application, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the proposed solution versus legacy wireless technology will be performed and quantitative and qualitative indicators will be used as TRL5 pass/fail criteria. 
The solutions will be standard solutions, i.e. not LiFi proprietary.",1
"Title: QBAS - A Quantum Boost for Atomic Sensors Abstract: Atom interferometry provides extremely sensitive measurements of quantities such as rotations and accelerations. This project will theoretically investigate how quantum entanglement between atoms and photons can enhance the sensitivity of atom-interferometry. The aim of this project is to drastically enhance the sensitivity of atom interferometers, to deliver practical sensing devices of unprecedented sensitivity.

"Title: FiTTeR - Developing a Fibrosis Targeting and Tissue Reparative (FiTTeR) Therapy for the Infarcted Myocardium via an Injectable Functionalized Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel Abstract: As a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow, I will develop, characterize, and determine the efficacy of a biomaterial platform to target pathologic fibrosis and promote tissue repair following myocardial infarction (MI). I have an ideal background and will perform well in this project based on my expertise in extracellular matrix (ECM) derived biomaterials, characterizing the immune response to biomaterials, and evaluating in vivo outcomes. The proposed system will consist of a protein fragment tethered to an injectable hydrogel. The hydrogel carrier will be composed of ECM, which has been shown to facilitate tissue repair processes by local modulation of immune cell phenotype . The cryptic protein fragment, recently isolated and recombinantly produced by the Stevens Group , has gained attention for its ability to regulate the onset of fibrosis by interfacing with cells to abrogate the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). No therapies currently exist to prevent or mitigate fibrosis. Developing a sophisticated delivery system for a cryptic protein fragment will enable the broad potential of targeting pathologic fibrosis to be realized. This system will be advantageous in simultaneously providing localized delivery, combined immunomodulatory and regulatory properties of the ECM and recombinant protein fragment, and sustained release of the protein fragment during degradation of the ECM hydrogel. The combination of my expertise (in ECM hydrogels, characterizing the host response to biomaterials, and translating technologies) and Prof Molly Stevens’s supervision and world-class interdisciplinary biomaterials-focused group, the 2014 Research Group of the Year (European Life Science Awards), at Imperial College London (ICL), together make this project ideally suited for success.",0

"Title: SUPERFLUIDITY - Superfluidity: a super-fluid, cloud-native, converged edge system Abstract: Superfluidity is “a state in which matter behaves like a fluid with zero viscosity”. Our project aims at achieving superfluidity in the network: the ability to instantiate services on-the-fly, run them anywhere in the network (core, aggregation, edge) and shift them transparently to different locations.
The SUPERFLUIDITY project tackles crucial shortcomings in today’s networks: long provisioning times, with wasteful over-provisioning used to meet variable demand; reliance on rigid and cost-ineffective hardware devices; daunting complexity emerging from three forms of heterogeneity: heterogeneous traffic and sources; heterogeneous services and needs; and heterogeneous access technologies, with multi-vendor network components.
The SUPERFLUIDITY solution is based on: a decomposition of network components and services into elementary and reusable primitives; a native, converged cloud-based architecture; the virtualization of radio and network processing tasks; platform-independent abstractions, permitting reuse of network functions across heterogeneous hardware platforms, while catering to the vendors’ need for closed platforms/implementations; and high performance software optimizations along with leveraging of hardware accelerators.
As a result, the 5G network will benefit from: i) location-independence: network services deployable in heterogeneous networks; ii) time-independence: near instantaneous deployment and migration of services; iii) scale-independence: transparent service scalability; and iv) hardware-independence: development and deployment of services with high performance irrespective of the underlying hardware.
Through these properties, SUPERFLUIDITY will provide a converged cloud-based 5G concept that will enable innovative use cases in the mobile edge, empower new business models, and reduce investment and operational costs.
The SUPERFLUIDITY consortium gathers an impressive and uncommon blend of Telco and IT players that can make its vision a reality.",1

"Title: GN4-3 - Horizon 2020: H2020-SGA-INFRA-GEANT-2018 (Topic [a] Research and Education Networking) Abstract: The GN4-3 is the proposed project for the third Specific Grant Agreement under the 68-month Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) established between the GÉANT Consortium and the European Commission in April 2015. This third phase of implementing the FPA is proposed to last 48 months and is a natural continuation of the work in GN4-2, building on the results and maintaining the overall objective of helping to raise European research to the next level, promoting scientific excellence, access and re-use of research data. 
GÉANT’s world-class, high-speed backbone provides seamless and secure connectivity with 42 National Research and Education Networks (NRENs), reaching over 50 million users in 10,000 institutions across Europe, and more than 100 countries worldwide through links with other regions. The core backbone is capable of multiple 100 Gbps transmission over each fibre link, and Terabit connectivity can be achieved by a single node. The safe and rapid connection of users to each other, to the increasing amounts of data generated by research, and to the high-performance computing capacity required by collaborative research form the foundation of the GÉANT partnership.
GÉANT services offer convenient, fast and reliable access to European High Performance Computing facilities, cloud services for the research and education community, access to scientific data and publications and other services from the European e-infrastructure providers, whenever and wherever needed. 
The structure of the present proposal emphasises updating existing services in line with requirements of the user community. This complements the proposed companion project GN4-3N, an ambitious programme increasing the footprint of the backbone network at the same time as improving its capacity, resilience and flexibility with the aim of offering 100Gbps network access to many more GÉANT partners and significantly diminish the digital divide.",1
"Title: UVMWREACT - Design, fabrication and optimization of a novel integrated UV-microwave assisted catalytic reactor for the continuous flow treatment of wastewater Abstract: UVMICROCAT uses an innovative catalytic mesh assisted by a combination of UV and microwave technology for fast and effective treatment of large volumes of wastewater for water re-use.

The project proposes an environmentally-friendly, totally innovative method for the treatment of toxic and recalcitrant contaminants in wastewater by enhancing the rate of a novel heterogeneous catalytic treatment process using microwave energy and ultraviolet radiation. The modified PAN catalysts developed at DMU has eliminated the need for iron removal post treatment and has broadened the pH range of application, whilst enabling continuous flow processes favoured by industry. In recent years, several reports have demonstrated the use of microwave and ultraviolet radiation to promote the oxidative degradation of bio-refractory wastes due to their advantages of speeding up the reaction, high-efficiency with no pollution to the environment. Nevertheless the use of microwaves in catalysis and in the water and wastewater industry remains at laboratory scale and therefore requires further in depth research. The major challenges in the water/wastewater industries are centered on the poor penetration depth of microwaves. In the project, we propose to design a UV and microwave assisted reactor which overcomes this scale-up problem. The design of the scalable microwave reactor will not only add new knowledge to the sector but open up new areas of industrial application for microwaves.",1
"Title: OPT-PCC - Optimized Dynamic Point Cloud Compression Abstract: 3D point clouds are receiving increased attention due to their potential for many important applications, such as real-time 3D immersive telepresence. Compared to traditional video technology, 3D point cloud systems allow free viewpoint rendering, as well as mixing of natural and synthetic objects. However, this improved user experience comes at the cost of increased storage and bandwidth requirements as point clouds are typically represented by the geometry and colour of millions up to billions of 3D points. For this reason, major efforts are being made to develop efficient point cloud compression schemes. The task, however, is very challenging due to the irregular structure of point clouds. To standardize these efforts, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) launched in January 2017 a call for proposals for 3D point cloud compression technology. In October 2017, the responses were evaluated and the first test model for lossy compression of dynamic point clouds (TMC2) was established. This test model defines a first “common core” algorithm for collaborative work towards the final standard. The aim of OPT-PCC is to contribute to these efforts by developing algorithms that optimize the rate-distortion performance of the test model. OPT-PCC’s objectives are to: 

1.	O1: build analytical models that accurately describe the effect of the geometry and colour quantization of a 3D point cloud on the bit rate and distortion; 
2.	O2: develop fast search algorithms that optimize the allocation of the available bit budget between the geometry information and colour information; 
3.	O3: implement a compression scheme for dynamic 3D point clouds that outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of rate-distortion performance. The target is to reduce the bit rate by at least 20% for the same reconstruction quality;  
4.	O4: provide multi-disciplinary training to the researcher in algorithm design, metaheuristic optimisation, computer graphics, and leadership and management skills.",1
"Title: AstroModulation - Astroglial control of axonal excitability, adaptation and  analogue signalling Abstract: Evidence has been emerging for astrocytes to play an important role in neuronal cooperation and information processing in the brain. Recent work has suggested that their activity may even regulate the shape of action potentials in the axon and thus the efficacy of synaptic transmission. However, the underlying physiological machinery remains poorly understood. We propose here that astrocytes play an active role in the analogue-digital regulation of presynaptic signalling. To decipher the role of astroglia in presynaptic signalling, in particular analogue-digital axonal information transfer, we focus on the giant mossy-fibre-CA3 synapse, well characterized in the host laboratory. Our working hypothesis is that astrocytes regulate spike generation and propagation in axons by modulating local extracellular potassium and possibly by releasing glutamate. To test this hypothesis, an innovative set of technique will be used: i) direct recordings of astrocytes and either presynaptic or postsynaptic elements of the synapse in the mossy-fibre to CA3 synapse; ii) genetic tools allowing specific targeting and stimulation of either astrocytes or neurons; iii) pioneering imaging tools, such as FLIM, to directly measure the calcium entry and glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter to reveal glutamate release by the astrocytes. The proposed project should unravel the mechanisms by which astrocytes control axonal information transfer in neural networks axonal excitability while shedding light on poorly understood features of astrocyte physiology.",0
"Title: INNOTARGETS - Innvative approaches to identification  of metabolic Targets for antimicrobials Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a challenge to human health and health-systems, and we need novel antimicrobials or drugs that can re-sensitize multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria to existing antimicrobials. Metabolic enzymes have largely been ignored in the search for antimicrobial targets, and they are an untapped resource. The aim of INNOTARGETS is to train ESRs in highly innovative approaches to identify metabolic drug targets in pathogenic bacteria. The training will deliver ESRs that can become creative, future research team leaders within industry or academia. The network joins 7 academic and 3 non-academic organisations, including two antibiotic discovery companies. The training is multi-disciplinary and trans-sectoral and provides 432 person-months of training to 12 ESRs. The types of targets foreseen are: 1) Metabolic enzymes that are essential for infection, Such enzymes will be identified by use of transposon libraries 2) Redundant enzymes, which can be blocked in parallel. Relevant pairs of enzymes will be identified by use of metabolic models, and a search for bioactive molecules, with affinity for more than one target will be carried out using a novel screening platform. 3) Metabolic enzymes which are essential for expression of resistance mechanisms or spread of resistance plasmids in MDR bacteria. Putative targets for all three types of reactions will be validated using cell culture and animal models.  

INNOTARGETS will establish a joint training syllabus designed to widen the career prospects of the ESRs and to optimize their professional competences. It includes training through research, including secondments, network wide training courses and summer schools, self-directed learning, workshops and training through interaction with external partners and visiting scientists.",0
"Title: SilentBorder - Cosmic Ray Tomograph for Identification of Hazardous and Illegal Goods hidden in Trucks and Sea Containers Abstract: Everyday our customs workers need to tackle counterfeit goods and piracy to protect the health and safety of our citizens, yet it is estimated that only a small fraction of cargo is inspected and even smaller fraction of illegal goods are detected. Today, the most widely used technology for scanning vehicles, ranging from vans and trucks to railcars, is gamma-ray and X-ray radiography. But new technologies are required for overcoming current technological shortcomings like inability to detect the materials, usage of radioactive and harmful source, low throughput to name some.
Cosmic-ray tomography (CRT) is considered as beyond the state-of-the-art technology in cargo screening. Cosmic-ray muons are highly penetrating, their average energy is about 10,000 times the energy of a typical X-ray and they are practically non-absorbable. They are suitable to identify materials hidden inside of shielded material, too thick or deep for other imaging methods. The CRT is completely passive, exploiting naturally occurring secondary cosmic radiation. Contrary to conventional X-ray or gamma-based imaging techniques it allows to distinguish between different materials and localizes it inside the cargo or vehicle by providing visualised 3D image.
We will bridge the major security gap for fast and safe inspection of large number of cargos by developing the Multi-Functional Passive Detection System. The detection capability is based on using high accuracy sensors for particle tracking in combination with beyond state-of-the art tomographic reconstruction and material classification algorithms.
The main objective of SilentBorder is to develop and validate a new high-technology CRT scanner for border guard, customs and LEAs that enables safe and fast screening, detection and identification of hazardous and illegal goods (e.g. SNM), contraband (e.g. tobacco or explosive) as well as hidden persons in up to 20’ iso containers.",1
"Title: GeoFodder - The scale and significance of early animal husbandry in SW Europe: development of an interdisciplinary high-resolution approach to the investigation of livestock diets and herding practices. Abstract: In the history of early farming, the absolute scale and relative importance of livestock and crop husbandry, their degree of
integration, and their landscape impact are largely obscure. To address this issue, GeoFodder will develop for the first time
an interdisciplinary methodology that integrates geoarchaeological and archaeobotanical techniques for archaeological
recognition of leafy browse and leafy fodder (currently not directly detectable) and for assessing the preservation of different
plant resource types, with the ultimate aim of reconstructing early livestock diet and herding practices. To achieve these
objectives, an innovative ethnoarchaeological and experimental programme will study present-day livestock penning
deposits (for which herding practices, animal diets and depositional processes are known) to determine how dietary and
other plant components are altered and partly preserved through ingestion, organic decay and (to sterilize pens) burning.
This will generate a suite of geoarchaeological and archaeobotanical proxies, for different plant types (taxa, anatomical
parts, seasons) with different preservation histories (ingested, decayed, burnt), that will then be applied to analysis of
prehistoric penning deposits in Iberian caves and rock-shelters. The resulting semi-quantitative data on livestock diet in
particular contexts will underpin modelling of the qualitative and temporal dimensions of early livestock grazing/
browsing and foddering at intra- and inter-site levels to enable assessment of the potential scale of herding and thus of the
likely mobility of livestock and relative importance of crops and livestock in early farming. Geofodder will thus advance our
understanding of early livestock husbandry in the SW Mediterranean, contribute to assessment of the long-term landscape
impact and sustainability of herding, and establish methodological standards for investigating such questions in other regions
and periods.",0
"Title: SICIS - Secure Indoor Communication empowered by Intelligent reflecting Surface Abstract: Due to the broadcast nature of transmission in the air, wireless communications are particularly vulnerable to security threats. Being an emerging wireless communication technology, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is able to achieve fine-grained passive reflect beamforming to constructively enhance the desired signal power at legitimate users and destructively deteriorate the reception at eavesdroppers. Therefore, IRS represents an excellent opportunity to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless communications in indoor environments, where over 80% of wireless traffic takes place. In order to achieve the full potential of IRS for secure indoor communications, breakthroughs in the fundamental theory and key techniques for IRS-aided secure indoor communications are urgently needed, including 1) channel estimation and MIMO channel modelling for indoor environments in presence of IRS; 2) joint beamforming design at both transmit antennas and IRS to maximise the secrecy performance; and 3) performance evaluation and optimisation of key parameters of IRS for secure indoor communications at a system level. In this project, we aim to make breakthroughs in these directions and bring the benefits of secure indoor wireless communications empowered by IRS to billions of users (people and things).",1
"Title: LocationWise - LocationWise Payment Card Validation: A cloud based location verification system that will significantly lower cost of payment card cyber security Abstract: The vision of LocationWise project is to lower fraud costs incurred by banks from €1.03 to €0.55 per transaction and thus saving Europe ca. €456 million annually. Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. €1.44 billion annually and €14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to €13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user’s mobile device to determine his/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%. Among other things, the purpose of Feasibility Study is to better understand the target market, determine optimum platform resources required to handle a given volume of transactions and to further refine IP strategy.",1
"Title: NEPHELE - eNd to End scalable and dynamically reconfigurable oPtical arcHitecture for application-awarE SDN cLoud datacentErs Abstract: Datacentre traffic is experiencing 2-digit growth challenging the scalability of current network architectures. The new concept of disaggregation exacerbates bandwidth and latency demands whereas emerging cloud business opportunities urge for reliable inter-datacenter networking. 
PROJECT will develop an end-to-end solution extending from the datacenter architecture and optical subsystem design to the overlaying control plane and application interfaces. PROJECT hybrid electronic-optical network architecture scales linearly with the number of datacenter hosts, offers Ethernet granularity and saves up to 94% power and 30% cost.  It consolidates compute and storage networks over a single, Ethernet optical TDMA network. Low latency, hardware-level dynamic re-configurability and quasi-deterministic QoS are supported in view of disaggregated datacenter deployment scenarios. A fully functional control plane overlay will be developed comprising an SDN controller along with its interfaces. The southbound interface abstracts physical layer infrastructure and allows dynamic hardware-level network reconfigurability. The northbound interface links the SDN controller with the application requirements through an Application Programming Interface. PROJECT innovative control plane enables Application Defined Networking and merges hardware and software virtualization over the hybrid optical infrastructure. It also integrates SDN modules and functions for inter-datacenter connectivity, enabling dynamic bandwidth allocation based on the needs of migrating VMs as well as on existing Service Level Agreements for transparent networking among telecom and datacenter operator’s domains. 
Fully-functional network subsystems will be prototyped: a 400Gb/s hybrid Top-of-Rack switch, a 50Gb/s electronic-optical smart Network Interface Card and a fast optical pod switch. PROJECT concept will be demonstrated in the lab and in its operational environment for both intra- and inter-datacenter scenario",1
"Title: EYEPOD - The vision-strike conversion: Neural control of the predatory strike behavior in stomatopods Abstract: Controlling how the body is propelled through space is paramount for survival of most animals. Many species, including humans, use feedback from their visual and proprioceptive systems to correct or confirm body movements. However, feedback is limited to events that form part of the past. For many high performance behaviors, such as catching a fast incoming ball, the appropriate movement must be 1. anticipated from a short observation period and 2. actuated without sensory feedback. 
 Understanding how visual information is processed and re-coded in a predictive manner for the purpose of movement implementation is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Such ballistic movements have been studied in predatory species, however previous investigations on the neural basis of such behaviour focus on the early circuits. Much less is known about the sensorimotor conversion of this behaviour. 
 Here I propose to investigate the sensorimotor control of the fastest predatory strike on earth, boasted by stomatopods. This work will yield novel insights and fill the current knowledge gap on the neural basis of anticipatory and ballistic movements. As one of the few world experts in the field of stomatopod visual ecology, I am uniquely qualified to initiate this line of research. 
This project utilizes both my expertise as a stomatopod visual ecologist and the expertise of my host supervisor, Paloma Gonzalez-Bellido, who is a leader in the use of behavioural, histological, and electrophysiological techniques to study sensorimotor conversion in predatory insects. Using a combination of our expertise, I will address three specific questions related to the vision-strike conversion in the stomatopod nervous system:
1.) What are the neural controls for releasing stomatopod ballistic strikes? 
2.) Which dimensions of visual stimuli influence the stomatopod strike decision-making process?
3.) What are common themes among arthropods for the neural control of anticipatory movements?",0
"Title: EmERGE - Evaluating mHealth technology in HIV to improve Empowerment and healthcare utilisation: Research and innovation to Generate Evidence for personalised care Abstract: EmERGE will develop a mHealth platform to enable self-management of HIV in patients with stable disease. The platform will build upon and integrate the existing mHealth solutions operated by pioneering healthcare providers in the UK and Spain and apply a rigorous co-design approach to ensure patient and clinician input to the solution. The platform will provide users with web based and mobile device applications which interface securely with relevant medical data and facilitate remote access to key healthcare providers   EATG, the European HIV patient organisation, will provide a direct and deep interaction with representative patients and clinicians from 5 EU countries. The platform and interfaces will be validated in a large study of 3900 patients using a tailored HTA process, MAST, specifically developed for the assessment of mHealth solutions including translatability as a key factor.  Based on prior work showing a high uptake rate and use of mHealth in HIV patient populations, EmERGE aims to demonstrate the benefits to patients and simultaneous increases in cost-effectiveness for healthcare providers by reducing face-to-face consultations, estimated at 6000 saved per year within this study alone. Patient reported outcomes will be agreed and used in the assessment and development of the system which also aims to increase adherence and enable frailty to be reported using mHealth technology.  Innovation will be given priority from the beginning by developing new business models of care provision, targeting key stakeholders in the EU health provider sector, including policymakers and clinicians, while eliciting demand from patients to highlight and initiate the widespread implementation and compensation of mHealth solutions within the timeframe of the project.  Guidelines and policy briefs will be produced to evidence the benefits and disseminate the lessons learned to support the uptake of mHealth for self-management of other chronic diseases.",1
"Title: 5G-TOURS - SmarT mObility, media and e-health for toURists and citizenS Abstract: 5G-TOURS will deploy full end-to-end trials to bring 5G to real users for thirteen representative use cases. The project will provide efficient and reliable close-to-commercial services for tourists, citizens and patients in three different types of cities: (i) Rennes, the safe city where e-health use cases will be demonstrated; (ii) Turin, the touristic city focused on media and broadcast use cases; and (iii) Athens, the mobility-efficient city that brings 5G to users in motion as well as to transport-related service providers. These services will not only improve the quality of life for citizens and tourists, but also represent an important business opportunity as they address industry segments accounting for more than 50% of the estimated revenues generated by verticals.

The fundamental feature of the 5G-TOURS concept is the dynamic use of the network to seamlessly provide different types of services adapted to the specific needs of individual use cases. 5G-TOURS will enable different capabilities such as network slicing, virtualisation, orchestration or broadcasting as well as additional features developed by the project to bring more flexibility and improved performance. The ambition is to fully demonstrate pre-commercial 5G technologies at a large scale, showing the ability of the 5G network to meet extreme and conflicting KPIs while supporting very diverse requirements on the same infrastructure.

The 5G-TOURS mobile network system will integrate strategic components of the ecosystem, including the network infrastructure, terminals and end-devices, the vertical solutions enabled by 5G, and the vertical customers receiving the services. 5G-TOURS has devised a thorough evaluation plan to scrutinise the viability of the use cases, addressing technical performance by analysing both network service KPIs and application-level KPIs, economic impact by analysing the estimated generated revenues and, ultimately, the satisfaction of the vertical customers.",1
"Title: METRO-HAUL - METRO High bandwidth, 5G Application-aware optical network, with edge storage, compUte and low Latency Abstract: METRO-HAUL is a project proposal addressing the Horizon 2020 ICT-07 5G PPP call; it is an RIA, focusing on strand 2 (high capacity elastic – optical networks) and strand 3 (software networks). The central topic is cost-efficient optical metro networks for 5G backhaul. 
The aim of this project is to design and build a smart, but cost-effective, optical metro infrastructure able to support traffic originating from heterogeneous 5G access networks, addressing the anticipated capacity increase and its specific characteristics such as mobility, low latency, and high bandwidth. This infrastructure will be able to also support a wide variety of 5G applications with special emphasis on services from various industries vertical to the ICT.
This will be achieved by architecting new access-facing and core-facing nodes, complete with storage and compute facilities, interconnected by novel, spectrally efficient, and adaptive optical transmission networks. Advanced concepts, such as hardware disaggregation and virtualisation, will assist in hitting challenging cost targets whilst enabling automation and programmability – all supported by a purpose-designed SDN-based control plane which will interface with client applications, intelligently catering for the wide range of 5G KPIs. 
METRO-HAUL will coordinate the disparate elements of transmission, switching, networking, compute, and storage, orchestrating dynamic solutions for multiple 5G applications. 
METRO-HAUL will carry out Proof of Concept demonstrations of its networking solution involving the interconnection of metro node prototypes, the use of the project's transmission technologies, and the associated control plane and orchestration software. The final project demonstrations will also involve the demonstration of actual 5G and vertical services across the METRO-HAUL test-bed.
Additionally, the project will actively participate in the relevant standardization bodies, promoting METRO-HAUL solutions to the wider community.",1
"Title: REVALUE - Recognising Energy Efficiency Value in Residential Buildings Abstract: ReValue aims to lead the development of appraisal norms and standards that REcorgnise Energy Efficiency Value in social and private residential real estate. 

Financing decisions in real estate are often based on formal appraisals of value. Current norms on valuation, such as RICS', recognise Energy Effiency (EE) as a potential source of value, but do not require taking this into account in appraisals, nor provide clear guidance on how to do so. As a result, investors are not provided with the formal basis to invest in or to provide financing (eg through mortgages) for EE components

For a standard renovation of a residential unit, up to 10k Euro in EE could be made ' bankable'  if valuation norms and standards would better reflect long term EE value. At EU level, this could potentially unlock 20Bn Euro per year in financing of EE measures. Since 26% of EUs energy is consumed in homes, increasing investment on EE could significantly contribute to H2020 targets

Specific ReValue objectives are:
1 develop and propose a set of norms and policies in the valuation of residential property that recognise EE
2 align valuation techniques with such norms
3 validate the framework in 4 pilot projects across Europe
4 Stimulate uptake of the framework through widely recognised norms and support from key industry stakeholders

ReValue's consortium is industry-lead, including RICS, one of the globally recognised standardisation bodies, and Savills, a leading valuer, and academic and professional experts in accounting, economics and EE design. Through observer roles, the project collaborates with building owners across Europe, investors and a range of entities that support exploitation and dissemination of project results
 
In doing so, ReValue will contribute to reaching EE19's expected impact, by aligning valuation norms for optimal levels of investment of energy efficiency, and by increasing trust of investors and financiers in the financial viability of energy efficient measures",0
"Title: Keep Control - Industrial Academic Initial Training Network towards specific diagnosis and treatment of age-related gait and balance deficits Abstract: Balance and gait deficits are ubiquitous among the older population, and lead to enormous personal, occupational and health care burden. Emerging pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to date have only small to moderate effects on these deficits. This is likely due to remaining fundamental questions on underlying mechanisms and treatment. The present project Keep Control consists of a rare EU-wide combination of experts from clinical, biomechanic and neuroscience research, along with experts from the industry, who all aim at gaining a better understanding and treatment of balance and gait deficits in older adults. We aim to scrutinize aspects such as: (1) comparability of balance and gait assessment in the clinic and the home environment, (2) gait and balance deficits as prodromal markers of neurodegeneration, and as markers to differentiate between Parkinsonian syndromes, (3) association between freezing of gait and balance, and (iv) gait and balance deficits in patients with sarcopenia. Tools such as sophisticated lab-based gait and balance assessment devices, perturbation treadmill, wearable devices, electrophysiology and blood and tissue investigations will be implemented. We will further employ promising therapeutic strategies for specific gait and balance deficits in older adults, including both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies. An entire work package will be dedicated to a novel harmonization and integration approach across the whole network: It will (i) harmonize assessment protocols based on the WHO definition of health and disability, to pave the way for an exhaustive meta-analysis of all data collected, and (ii) foster the active involvement of all study participants by implementation of a participant-controlled medical record. In summary, Keep control will cover the entire range of expertise necessary and utilize cutting edge technology to educate fellows in the area of gait and balance deficits in older adults.",0
"Title: AMPWISE - Autonomous Wireless Current Sensor for Aircraft Power Lines Abstract: AMPWISE will develop an energy autonomous wireless smart and low-cost current sensor for remotely monitoring of electric lines in the context of the coming generation of aircraft. 
This includes the definition of a sensor architecture co-designed to achieve an optimal balance between the harvested energy and the consumption of sensor and electronics, while meeting the desirable sensing, latency and sampling specifications. 
The current sensor design will build on an existing product adapted to meet the form-factor, size and sensing requirements. The simulation of the wireless communication system will guide and validate the design and parameters. The wireless communication will operate in the desirable 4.2-4.4 GHz band in compliance with ITU regulations. The protocol will support reliable, secure, low-power and time-bounded communications, and will tolerate interference and co-existing networks, including in metallic environments. The power supply will use inductive power line harvesting and a resonant power management approach to improve power density, dynamically tunable to the line frequency, and employing magnetic field guiding to meet form factor and installation requirements. The developed concept will reach TRL 5. A laboratory testing facility will be used for evaluating the integrated wireless sensor network. 
The consortium includes two industry, SENIS (CH), a sensor manufacturer, and SERMA (FR), an OEM for aeronautical equipment. It also includes CSEM (CH), a RTD with long experience in space and aeronautical projects and Imperial College London (U.K.), a university with significant track record in Energy Harvesting, including prototypes for aircraft. The project will build on existing expertise on aircraft power line harvesting and consortium-level experience, know-how and method in co-designing wireless autonomous aircraft sensors. CSEM, Imperial and Serma have previously worked together on developing such aircraft sensors, within Cleansky.",1
"Title: CARAMEL - Artificial Intelligence based cybersecurity for connected and automated vehicles Abstract: The damaging effects of cyberattacks to an industry like the Cooperative Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) can be tremendous. From the least important to the worst ones, one can mention for example the damage in the reputation of vehicle manufacturers, the increased denial of customers to adopt CCAM, the loss of working hours (having direct impact on the European GDP), material damages, increased environmental pollution due e.g., to traffic jams or malicious modifications in sensors’ firmware, and ultimately, the great danger for human lives, either they are drivers, passengers or pedestrians. CARAMEL’s goal is to proactively address modern vehicle cybersecurity challenges applying advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and also to continuously seek methods to mitigate associated safety risks.

In order to address cybersecurity considerations for the already here autonomous and connected vehicles, well established methodologies coming from the ICT sector will be adopted, allowing to assess vulnerabilities and potential cyberattack impacts. Although past initiatives and cybersecurity projects related to the automotive industry have reached to security assurance frameworks for networked vehicles, several newly introduced technological dimensions like 5G, autopilots, and smart charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) introduce cybersecurity gaps, not addressed satisfactorily yet. Considering the entire supply chain of automotive operations, CARAMEL targets to reach to commercial anti-hacking IDS/IPS products for the European automotive cybersecurity and to demonstrate their value through extensive attack and penetration scenarios.",1
"Title: GLYCOSENSE - Polymer brush sensing arrays for the identification of pathogens Abstract: Surfaces with the capacity for selective recognition of particular pathogens would offer great potential in a number of biomedical applications, including diagnostic devices. Mammalian cells are decorated with a carbohydrate-rich layer, the glycocalyx, which facilitates cellular recognition. Carbohydrate-binding proteins can interact with these sugar motifs to facilitate highly selective recognition, a strategy which is exploited by many viral and bacterial pathogens. Such species have evolved to display recognition units on their surfaces which may interact with considerable affinity with glycan structures displayed on cellular surfaces. This molecular recognition constitutes a key step in the processes of infection or toxicity, and is therefore an attractive target for the development of diagnostic devices. In this project, Dr Clare Mahon proposes to develop surface-tethered polymer brushes which will mimic the glycocalyx in terms of facilitating adhesion of pathogens. Through the incorporation of different fluorophores, the surfaces will be used to construct sensing arrays which will enable the rapid and cost-effective identification of water-borne pathogens and common respiratory pathogens.",0
"Title: 5GASP - 5G Application & Services experimentation and certification Platform Abstract: As 5G approaches a very high maturity level, the testing and validation of the innovations achieved in 5G by integrators and verticals service providers has become of utmost importance. Verticals have very different needs, such as the case of the Automotive industry and Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR). This will therefore require different levels of support in taking their applications and services from concepts, to prototypes and finally to products. However, it is also more and more frequent that services in different verticals need to exchange data, particularly mobility services such as those found in connected automobiles and PPDR.
5GASP aims at shortening the idea-to-market process through the creation of a European testbed for SMEs that is fully automated and self-service, in order to foster rapid development and testing of new and innovative NetApps built using the 5G NFV based reference architecture. Building on top of existing physical infrastructures, 5GASP intends to focus on innovations related to the operation of experiments and tests across several domains, providing software support tools for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) of VNFs in a secure & trusted environment for European SMEs capitalizing in the 5G market. 5GASP targets the creation of an Open Source Software (OSS) repository and of a VNF marketplace targeting SMEs with OSS examples and building blocks, as well as the incubation of a community of NetApp developers assisted with tools and services that can enable an early validation and/or certification of products and services for 5G. We focus on inter-domain use-cases, development of operational tools and procedures (supporting day-to-day testing and validation activities) and security/trust of 3rd party IPR running in our testbeds.",1

"Title: EENVEST - Risk reduction for Building Energy Efficiency investments Abstract: EEnvest aims at supporting investors´ decision making process by translating building’s energy efficiency technical requirements into economic indicators. These indicators are in turn used to evaluate financial risks associated with deep renovation investment and to include non-energy benefits in asset evaluation models. EEnvest will allow the financial sector to match the EE investments demand and offer for commercial office buildings located in Italy and Spain. EEnvest will increase financers’, investors’, owners’ and users’ mutual trust, by identifying, quantifying and mitigating technical risks associated to those investments as well as by reducing the cost of credit for lenders through targeted risk reduction actions.  EEnvest will develop effective evaluation methods for the technical/financial risk correlation by categorising a number of major technical risks and quantifying their impact on investors´ confidence. Those risks 
will be i) evaluated exploiting existing databases on building energy efficiency (e.g. DEEP database of Energy Efficincy Financial Institutions Group), ii) organized into investor friendly bechmark track record and iii) transferred on a web-based platform through secured blockchain networks The investment demand and offer will be supported by the EEnvest - search&match investment evaluation web-based platform, integrating building stock evaluation data, both from the technical and the financial side. EEnvest approach will be replicable in more countries and business cases thanks to the standardization of technical/financial due diligence framework for energy efficiency renovation of buildings and to the search&match web-based platform allowing deep renovation investments to be more appealing on the financial market.",0
"Title: SMARTER-2 - Surveillance of MARiTime surroundings through lasER technology Abstract: Contact and collision incidences are now the most increasing, most frequent and overall the most costly type of accidents in the maritime transport sector, representing 40% of yearly insurance claims and force 1 out of 10 ships to an unplanned dry dock every year costing on average €400,000 per incident. Semi and fully submerged objects are particularly causing havoc to shipping and offshore platforms because they go undetected by state-of-the-art sensors (radars, sonars, optical sensors) presenting an acute need for improved observation capability of the ocean surface layer. A major concern considering the importance of shipping in general (90% of world’s trade), their asset value (up to € 1 Billion cost to build) and the number of people at sea (about 2 Billion transported yearly). Similarly, the maritime security situation is worsening forcing vessels in average to spend €170,000 a year on security related solutions. The project opportunity arises from today’s inability to observe this challenging ocean layer, causing unsatisfying operational risks in a greatly expanding market (with more frequent and more costly security and safety incidents in line with the strong industry expansion). These incidents can be reduced by an appropriate observational sensor like a ladar. It can detect for example drifting growlers (ice floes) or floating containers ahead of a vessel, preventing damaging collisions. The information that the sensor collects can also be directly used for operators to reduce operational cost, for example by accurately observing the sea state as to optimize sail plan models and vessel trim for fuel and emission savings. Such benefits have value for the operators, allowing them to purchase a relatively low cost sensor compared to the costs of an offshore or maritime incident. Moreover, the ladar is complementary to radar, sonar, and other maritime sensors. It would therefore fill a market gap rather than outcompeting existing sensor technologies.",1
"Title: SMARTsurg - SMart weArable Robotic Teleoperated Surgery Abstract: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) offers many advantages when compared to traditional MIS, including improved vision, precision and dexterity. While the popularity of RAMIS is steadily increasing, the potential for improving patient outcomes and penetrating into many procedures is not fully realised, largely because of serious limitations in the current instrumentation, control and feedback to the surgeon. Specifically, restricted access, lack of force feedback, and use of rigid tools in confined spaces filled with organs pose challenges to full adoption. We aim to develop novel technology to overcome barriers to expansion of RAMIS to more procedures, focusing on real-world surgical scenarios of urology, vascular surgery, and soft tissue orthopaedic surgery. A team of highly experienced clinical, academic, and industrial partners will collaborate to develop: i) dexterous anthropomorphic instruments with minimal cognitive demand ii) a range of bespoke end-effectors with embedded surgical tools using additive manufacturing methods for rapid prototyping and testing utilizing a user-centred approach, iii) wearable multi-sensory master for tele-operation to optimise perception and action and iv) wearable smart glasses for augmented reality guidance of the surgeon based on real-time 3D reconstruction of the surgical field, utilising dynamic active constraints and restricting the instruments to safe regions. The demonstration platform will be based on commercial robotic manipulators enhanced with the SMARTsurg advanced hardware and software features. Testing will be performed on laboratory phantoms with surgeons to bring the technology closer to exploitation and to validate acceptance by clinicians. The study will benefit patients, surgeons and health providers, by promoting safety and ergonomics as well as reducing costs. Furthermore, there is a potential to improve complex remote handling procedures in other domains beyond RAMIS.",0
"Title: BacterialCORE - Widespread Bacterial CORE Complex Executes Intra- and Inter-Kingdom  Cytoplasmic Molecular Trade Abstract: The enormous versatility of bacteria enables the formation of multi-species communities that colonize nearly every niche on earth, making them the dominant life form and a major component of the biomass. Exchange of molecular information among neighboring bacteria in such communities, as well as between bacteria and proximal eukaryotic cells, is key for bacterial success. Yet, the principles controlling these multicellular interactions are poorly defined. Here we describe the identification of a bacterial protein complex, herein termed CORE, whose function is to traffic cytoplasmic molecules among different bacterial species, and between pathogenic bacteria and their human host cells. The CORE is composed of five membrane proteins, highly conserved across the entire bacterial kingdom, providing a ubiquitous platform that facilitates both intra- and inter-kingdom crosstalk. Our preliminary data support the idea that the CORE acts as a shared module for the assembly of larger apparatuses, executing this universal molecular flow among organisms. We propose to elucidate components, structure and biogenesis of the CORE machinery, operating during bacteria-bacteria and pathogen-host interactions. We further aim to provide an unbiased-global view of the extent and identity of cytoplasmic molecules traded via CORE including metabolites, proteins and RNA, and to reveal the criteria determining the specificity of the transported cargo. Furthermore, we intend to decipher the impact of CORE-mediated molecular exchange on bacterial physiology and virulence, and devise anti-CORE compounds to combat pathogenic bacteria. This study is expected to transform the way we currently view bacterial communities and host-pathogen interactions. We anticipate these findings to lead to the development of creative strategies to modulate, predict and even design bacterial communities, and lay the foundation for new and innovative approaches to fight bacterial diseases.

"Title: REACH - Renewable Energy and Connectivity Hub Abstract: While in the developed regions availability of electricity power has paved the way of sustainable development, it is still not available to ca. 18% of the world population, living in rural areas in developing countries and refugee camps worldwide. No access to power indicates exhausting effort for covering basic needs, which impedes sustainable social and economic development. Nearly 700 million people worldwide have mobile phone connections but no access to the electricity. In India, people belong to off-grid communities need to travel approximately 15 km to get their mobile phone charged. We have developed a unique solar power based Hub system and remote payment control mechanism by which electronic devices can be charged under the control of a central server to ensure accountability and transparency. This will enable EU companies to enter in €8 to 10 billion untouched market by delivering essential internet-based services (e.g., e-health, e-education, e-governance etc). BuffaloGrid supplies Hubs free of cost to local agents. This will stimulate local enterprise, encourage entrepreneurship and boost economic development. During SMEi Phase – 1 feasibility study, we have identified several technical improvements that are mainly focused on further development of the Hub, PCB and server designs. For commercial feasibility of the project, we have successfully performed market research, environmental impact assessment, partnership establishment, risk analysis and competitor analysis. During this project, we aim to reach from TRL7 to TRL9 and will make the product ready for mass scale deployment. We will focus on technical design improvement of the Hub for cost reduction (60%) and will finalise optimised system for mass scale production. We will also validate Hub functionality and server operations and will trial online services of EU SMEs in the field. Our commercialization plan is to deploy minimum 50,000 hubs across India, Sub-Sahara Africa and Refugee camps by 2021.",1
"Title: WATERPROTECT - Innovative tools enabling drinking WATER PROTECTion in rural and urban environments Abstract: High-quality, safe, and sufficient drinking water is essential for life: we use it for drinking, food preparation and cleaning. Agriculture is the biggest source of pesticides and nitrate pollution in European fresh waters. The overarching objective of WATERPROTECT is to contribute to effective uptake and realisation of management practices and mitigation measures to protect drinking water resources. Therefore WATERPROTECT will create an integrative multi-actor participatory framework including innovative instruments that enable actors to monitor, to finance and to effectively implement management practices and measures for the protection of water sources. We propose seven case studies involving multiple actors in implementing good practices (land management, farming, product stewardship, point source pollution prevention) to ensure safe drinking water supply. The seven case studies cover different pedo-climatic conditions, different types of farming systems, different legal frameworks, larger and smaller water collection areas across the EU. In close cooperation with actors in the field in the case studies (farmers associations, local authorities, water producing companies, private water companies, consumer organisations) and other stakeholders (fertilizer and plant protection industry, environment agencies, nature conservation agencies, agricultural administrations) at local and EU level, WATERPROTECT will develop innovative water governance models investigating alternative pathways from focusing on the ‘costs of water treatment’ to ‘rewarding water quality delivering farming systems’. Water governance structures will be built upon cost-efficiency analysis related to mitigation and cost-benefit analysis for society, and will be supported by spatially explicit GIS analyses and predictive models that account for temporal and spatial scaling issues. The outcome will be improved participatory methods and public policy instruments to protect drinking water resources.",0
"Title: FreeWheel - Lifecycle-reconfigurable Smart Mobility Platform to enable autonomous and cost-effective personalized solutions for social inclusion of disabled and elderly while leveraging AM technologies Abstract: FreeWheel promotes social inclusion of disabled and elderly people through a urban mobility solution consisting of a unit integrating an autonomous “smart active” module, multiple custom interfaces and an app. Such a solution can be either rented (a sharing service available at in-door and out-door urban facilities), or sold; in the latter case the unit includes a fully personalized wheelchair. 

FreeWheel satisfies the need for customization, both on the user and on the vehicle side, through the implementation of a modular concept based on standard reconfigurable, low-cost modules (e.g. engine, gears, control unit, HMI, etc.) and on ultra-customized interfaces (e.g. body-to-vehicle, engine-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, etc.), produced via additive manufacturing. Re-configurability is achieved through an easy exchange of standard modules in different products. 

A further objective is making affordable the lifecycle cost of the above-mentioned mobility service (and/or product) through an innovative business model that offers mobility as a service (independent of vehicle ownership) and by leveraging dematerialization (reduction of manufacturing lead times and investment costs) and product re-configurability. 

The expected impact is:
-	Social inclusion of elderly and disabled citizens: the project will demonstrate affordability and safety in accessing public spaces in urban areas;
-	Short time-to-market: 70% less than the conventional approach. 
-	Significant cost reduction in the manufacturing of a personalised wheelchair unit as a result of the re-usability and adaptability of personalised products components; 
-	Ultra-low environmental impact: re-usability of modules and efficient manufacturing leading to more than 70% in environmental impact reduction regarding primary resources consumed while offering this mobility service.",1
"Title: DIGISILK - Digital Infrastructures Along the New Silk Road: A Mixed-methods Exploration of China's Digital Investments in Its Borderland Regions Abstract: As part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has recently launched the “Digital Silk Road” program, focused on investments in digital technologies and infrastructure in countries that are part of its loosely reimagined Silk Road. This program is seen as having the potential to create a second, China-led internet, which splits from the US-centered one and is ruled by a different set of priorities and values. Are the Digital Silk Road and the global expansion of Chinese tech companies prefiguring a future with two internets: an existing one that is US-led and founded on market-driven ideology, and a new, alternative one that is China-led and characterized by state control, national boundaries, and national governance over what began as a borderless new space? What values and politics are built into the various components of the Digital Silk Road, and is - or how is - the internet they are creating fundamentally different from the current one? 

The project will employ qualitative and ethnographic methods, digital methods, and document analysis to understand the emergence of the Digital Silk Road from the ground-up and from the comparative perspective of business, governments, and ordinary people in four countries: China, where Digital Silk Road policies, finances, devices, online platforms and apps originate; Kazakhstan, a key player in Central Asia; Myanmar, whose economic dependence on China is the cause of considerable ambivalence; and Cambodia, that under Prime Minister Hun Sen has been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Chinese investments.

The project aims at illuminating the deployment of the Digital Silk Road to see what this second internet might consist of; seeks to understand what values and politics are embedded in it; and explores how they are received and negotiated in the countries concerned, thus contributing to the wider debate on values, ethics, and technology.",1
"Title: OPTIYARD - Optimised Real-time Yard and Network Management Abstract: The Commission’s 2011 White Paper states that by 2050, rail should substantially expand its modal share over medium and long distances. This is consistent with the Policy goals of expanding rail capacity, both cited in the Horizon 2020 and Shift2Rail (S2R) calls. Considering the ambitious Horizon 2020 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) calling for a surge in the utilisation of capacity within a range 70-90%, yards, hubs and terminals play a key role in facilitating this step-change by contributing to a competitive, reliable and safe freight transport.  
To meet the needs of S2R and Horizon 2020, OptiYard will design decision support tool for yard managers that will help them to optimise processes and manage their yards more efficiently. It will do this in real-time, with interaction with relevant network. The processes must be performed in real-time, to guarantee on-time delivery and operational efficiency, in particular, for single wagon transport. 
OptiYard addresses critical operational points of the transport chain (both rail marshalling yards or as transfer points to other modes) to improve capacity and reliability. OptiYard will facilitate real-time interaction between yard and relevant network IT systems that allow for software based planning and ultimately optimisation of single wagonload and blocktrain operational processes.
Building on the current state of the art and practice, the ambition of OptiYard is to provide a fully functional software module where real-time yard management, interaction with the network and ad-hoc timetable planning will be simulated in real-time. The optimization module and algorithms will be proven for large and complex freight transport networks, and integrate well with IP5 activities towards automation, e.g. intelligent assets and automated shunting and mainline operations.",1
"Title: OmnImmune - Manufacturing and testing of an allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapy for the treatment of cancer Abstract: Europe is experiencing an unprecedented cancer epidemic, driven by our ageing population. Traditional cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have demonstrated very limited efficacy for patients with late-stage disease and often cause considerable side effects.
Cell therapies are the next breakthrough in oncology, but autologous cells must be harvested from each patient, expanded for several weeks in vitro and re-administered to the same patient while hospitalized. 
TCB, a Scottish SME, brings the first allogeneic gamma delta T cell therapy (OmnImmune) where T cells harvested from healthy donors are used to treat multiple recipients. 
OmnImmune represents a truly disruptive, step-changing approach to the treatment of a wide variety of cancers. It has the potential to be manufactured for large market segments at a lower cost than competitors and provide valuable increases to the quality of life of life.
OmnImmune will provide next generation cancer treatment at 20% of the cost of any other cell therapy, saving €24Bn per year for 60,000 patients treated.
OmnImmune’s unique characteristics make it a truly disruptive treatment solution for patients and clinicians:
Multifunctional treatment solution: available to all cancer patients, regardless of their disease grade or immune status
Predicted high safety profile: minimal side-effects based on clinical data from trials of autologous GDT cells (to be confirmed in dose-escalation clinical trial)
Ease of use and lower cost: frozen dose-ready units available for immediate patient administration.
The SME Instrument funding will accelerate the development of the OmnImmune therapy and reduce its time to market from 10 years to 6 years. This will allow OmnImmune to reach the market by 2024.",0
"Title: PLUG-N-HARVEST - PLUG-N-play passive and active multi-modal energy HARVESTing systems, circular economy by design, with high replicability for Self-sufficient Districts Near-Zero Buildings Abstract: Conventional Retrofitting (CR) can result in high energy use reductions at the expense of high installation costs and, usually, without being able to directly perform harvesting from Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Building Automation (BA) systems, as compared to CR, can result in medium energy use reductions and in low or medium harvesting from RES at the expense of medium installation costs and medium operational costs. Recently, the concept of Adaptable/Dynamic Building Envelopes (ADBE) - such as Multifunctional Façade Modules - has been proposed towards overcoming many of the shortcomings of CR and BA. ADBE systems can result in high energy use reductions and high harvesting from RES at the expense of medium-to-high installation costs and medium operational costs. The main strategic goal of the PLUG-N-HARVEST proposal is to design, develop, demonstrate and exploit a new modular, plug-n-play concept/product for ADBE - deployable to both residential and non-residential buildings - which is able to provide high (maximum possible) energy use reductions and high (maximum possible) energy harvesting from RES both at the single-building and the district scale while requiring medium-to-low installation costs and almost-zero operational costs. Moreover, by appropriately exploiting its attributes, the PLUG-N-HARVEST system will be designed and implemented considering circular economy principles, which will allow implementing new business models based on leasing and renting modes and, by this, leaving the door open to massive implementations. Four different multi-building Pilots – in Germany, Spain, Greece and the U.K. - will be used for demonstrating the use of the integrated PLUG-N-HARVEST system in full-scale, on a 24/7 basis and for a long period. The Pilots involve buildings with all different kinds of energetic, thermal and occupants' interactions, home occupants of highly diverse behaviour and background and include both residential and non-residential buildings.",0
"Title: Hydra - Hybrid power-energy electrodes for next generation  lithium-ion batteries Abstract: The core technological approach of the HYDRA project consists of using hybrid electrode technology to overcome the fundamental limits of current Li-ion battery technology in terms of energy, power, safety and cost to enter the age of generation 3b of Li ion batteries. 

HYDRA, taking its name from the mythological beast, will use a multi-headed integrative approach: In addition to novel material development and scale-up of components and battery cells manufacturing, assisted by modelling, HYDRA will build a synergy with strong investments by the project’s industrial partners and foster reaching and keeping a significant market share for Europe.

The necessary competitiveness will be obtained by hybridizing high energy with high power materials. 
These materials will be implemented at the cell/electrode level, via sustainable, eco-designed scaled-up manufacture and safe electrolyte systems, demonstrated in pilot scale to TRL6, and will be ready for commercialisation 3 years after the project end. 

To reach this target, HYDRA mobilizes a strong industry commitment: the partners include a strong value-chain of suppliers with global competitiveness for xEV batteries and a direct liaison to the market in sectors such as automotive and maritime transport, ensuring a fast-uptake of results, with an added value of 1BN € in the next decade.

Ecological and economical sustainability also keep a strong importance, as HYDRA will be performing life cycle assessments and value-chain analyses on local and global scales. All aspects from raw materials via battery cell production and end-use/market to recycling and 2nd life usage will be evaluated. 

The HYDRA concept uses abundant electrode materials like iron, manganese and silicon, and eliminates the use of the CRMs cobalt and natural graphite, with a net CRM reduction of >85%. The new materials will be produced in an environmentally friendly, energy-efficient manner, and using water in place of organic solvents.",0
"Title: HarvestAll - Development of multi-source micro energy harvesting power management devices Abstract: Many IoT market leaders incl. ARM Holdings (the world's leading semiconductor IP supplier) predict that the IoT will begin to free itself from battery power in 2018.  Without reducing the reliance on battery power, there is a significant roadblock in reaching trillions of devices. Future devices will need to be self-sufficient and operate without any battery swaps or any human intervention for decades. This will be made possible through harvesting of all the available ambient energy in the environment, for example:
Thermal energy associated with static and dynamic temperature differences;
Vibration energy e.g. from vehicles driving over a bridge or oil following through a pipe;
Light energy from indoor artificial lighting. 
For these predictions to be realised, the current roadblock is micro energy harvesting systems that can effectively capture all available energy using just one energy management device. The technical challenge is that these ambient energy sources have widely different electrical characteristics that must be managed e.g: photovoltaic and thermoelectric harvesters are low-voltage DC, resistive, “trickle” sources; electrodynamic harvesters are high-voltage, inductive, “pulsed” sources whilst piezoelectric harvesters are high-voltage AC, capacitive, “bursty” sources.
Trameto is a UK-based fabless semiconductor business that is focusing on bringing ‘HarvestAll’ to market. HarvestAll enables energy harvesting from any-single harvester type, many-identical harvesters and multiple-different harvester types. This functionality is not currently available in the market. This project will help us to: further strengthen our market understanding, formalise existing and build new relationships with partners across the energy harvesting ecosystem to develop our supply chain and routes to market. This project will take us closer to having an exploitable technology that will achieve an ROI of 13.9:1 through sales of our novel energy management chip.",1
"Title: socSMCs - Socialising Sensori-Motor Contingencies Abstract: As robots become more omnipresent in our society, we are facing the challenge of making them more socially competent. However, in order to safely and meaningfully cooperate with humans, robots must be able to interact in ways that humans find intuitive and understandable. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach for understanding and modelling social behaviour and implementing social coupling in robots. Our approach presents a radical departure from the classical view of social cognition as mind-reading, mentalising or maintaining internal rep-resentations of other agents. This project is based on the view that even complex modes of social interaction are grounded in basic sensorimotor interaction patterns. SensoriMotor Contingencies (SMCs) are known to be highly relevant in cognition. Our key hypothesis is that learning and mastery of action-effect contingencies are also critical to enable effective coupling of agents in social contexts. We use “socSMCs” as a shorthand for such socially rele-vant action-effect contingencies. We will investigate socSMCs in human-human and human-robot social interaction scenarios. The main objectives of the project are to elaborate and investigate the concept of socSMCs in terms of information-theoretic and neurocomputational models, to deploy them in the control of humanoid robots (PR2, REEM-C) for social entrainment with humans, to elucidate the mechanisms for sustaining and exercising socSMCs in the human brain, to study their breakdown in patients with autism spectrum disorders, and to benchmark the socSMCs approach in several demonstrator scenarios. Our long term vision is to realize a new socially competent robot technology grounded in novel insights into mechanisms of functional and dysfunctional social behavior, and to test novel aspects and strategies for human-robot interaction and cooperation that can be applied in a multitude of assistive roles relying on highly compact computational solutions.",0
"Title: TANGO - Transparent heterogeneous hardware Architecture deployment for eNergy Gain in Operation Abstract: Computer systems have faced significant power challenges over the past 20 years; these challenges have shifted from the devices and circuits level, to their current position as first-order constraints for system architects and software developers. TANGO’s goal is to characterise factors which affect power consumption in software development and operation for heterogeneous parallel hardware environments. Our main contribution is the combination of requirements engineering and design modelling for self-adaptive software systems, with power consumption awareness in relation to these environments. The energy efficiency and application quality factors are integrated in the application lifecycle (design, implementation, operation). To support this, the key novelty of the project is a reference architecture and its implementation. Moreover, a programming model with built-in support for various hardware architectures including heterogeneous clusters, heterogeneous chips and programmable logic devices will be provided. TANGO will create a new cross-layer programming approach for heterogeneous parallel hardware architectures featuring automatic code generation including software and hardware modelling. This will consider power, performance, data location and time criticality optimization, in addition to security and dependability on the target hardware architecture. These results will be demonstrated in two real-world applications: reconfigurable power optimized connected platform and HPC. In order to improve collaboration and sustainability of TANGO’s and fellow projects results, TANGO considers the foundation of a Research Alliance in which complementary research efforts into novel programming approaches will nucleate, leading to a strong research collaboration and effective integration of project results.",0
"Title: GamECAR - Gamification of EcoDriving Behaviours through Intelligent Management of dynamic car and driver information Abstract: Driving style is seen not only to become a significant cause of greenhouse gas (GHG) and other air pollutant emissions but also a critical parameter regarding road safety, with huge social & financial adverse effects. 
GamECAR aims to develop a highly innovative and interactive Serious Games platform that will empower and guide users to adopt an eco-friendly driving style. This will be achieved, without distracting users from safe driving, through a multidisciplinary approach aiming at the development of a user friendly, unobtrusive multi-player gaming environment, where the users will not only play collaboratively/competitively using their mobile device but also using the car itself and their own bodies, thus turning eco-driving into an immersive and highly motivating experience. The sensing infrastructure of GamECAR will not only acquire data related to driving from an OBD sensor that will capture a complex set of parameters related to eco-driving, but will also sense environmental and physiological parameters of the driver, so as to better position the state of the system (car) in context (environment, user). The use of virtual user models and cognitive modeling of the users, will further boost personalization and adaptation of the game itself with respect to the needs of the individual driver.
The GamECAR system will be quantified and evaluated in test campaigns with drivers in three different sites. Quantification campaigns serve system development and evaluation campaigns demonstrate usefulness and exploitation potential. Finally, the project has a clear exploitation plan through a balanced and highly complementary composition of SMEs that have specific roles in the development of the integrated GamECAR system.
The impact of such a holistic and innovative approach is huge and the foundations laid here are expected to result in a widespread adoption of sensor-based gamification platforms in areas going far beyond eco-driving.",1
"Title: SHEALTHY - Non-Thermal physical technologies to preserve healthiness of fresh and minimally processed fruit and vegetables Abstract: SHEALTHY proposal aims to assess and develop an optimal combination of non-thermal sanitization, preservation and stabilization methods to improve the safety (inactivation of pathogens and spoilage microorganisms), while preserving the nutritional quality (up to 30%) and prolonging the shelf-life (up to 50%) of minimally processed F&V products. By combining and modulating non-thermal technologies with minimally processing operation, we will respond to consumers’ demand for fresh, healthy, convenient, sustainable and locally produced and additive-free food. The combined and optimised mild technologies will be demonstrated and validated in 2 business cases: Minimally processed fruits and vegetables and Fruit and vegetable-based juices & smoothies. Sanitization during washing will be optimized by applying in combination ultrasound (US), electrolysed water, plasma activated water, High Intensity Pulsed Light and Blue Light. Bioactive coating, active and intelligent packaging will be applied for quality preservation and shelf life extension of minimally processed F&V. F&V-based juices & smoothies will be stabilized by US and high pressure processing. For F&V by-product valorisation, US, pulsed electric field and membrane filtration will be used to extract bioactive compounds.
Sustainable and flexible processing methods will be transferred and adapted to the need of local F&V micro and SMEs, interconnecting primary producers through novel cooperative business models and new logistics systems, to enhance the traceability and authenticity of raw materials along the F&V value chain. 
Commercial feasibility will be assessed, including consumer acceptance and regulatory, safety and environmental aspects. SHEALTHY will combine the technology trends and consumer needs to afford the business models, technology transfer and market orientation that will facilitate the transition towards a new collaborative agrifood ecosystem for traditional, local and rural SMEs around EU.",0
"Title: InComEss - INNOVATIVE POLYMER-BASED COMPOSITE SYSTEMS FOR HIGH-EFFICIENT ENERGY SCAVENGING AND STORAGE Abstract: InComEss seeks at developing efficient smart materials with energy harvesting and storage capabilities combining advanced polymer based-composite materials into a novel single/multi-source concept to harvest electrical energy from mechanical energy and/or waste heat ambient sources. Three Energy Harvesting Systems (EHSs) configurations will be realized through the combination of high performance piezoelectric (PE), thermoelectric (TE) and Thermo-Piezoelectric (TPE) generators and monolithic supercapacitors (SCs) to power selected wireless sensors nodes to be implemented in different IoT scenarios for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in buildings and aircrafts (using a new miniature wireless Fiber Optics Sensing (FOS) interrogator) and accurate location and monitoring of vehicles through GPS and MEMS sensing. Advanced concepts for efficient energy transfer will be implemented for increased energy conversion efficiency of the overall EHSs.
InComEss EHSs will involve  the following smart materials developments: 1) advanced lead-free PE composite-based mono-/bi-component fibres with enhanced PE characteristics up to 100ºC/250ºC for their application into single/hybrid PE/TPE generators; 2) innovative high-performance thermoplastic-based p-and n-type TE composites with enhanced Seebeck coefficients in the range from –25ºC up to 250ºC for their application in single/hybrid PE/TPE generators; and 3) printable high energy density PANI/carbon-based composite electrode materials with enhanced specific capacitance and stability for their incorporation into the monolithic supercapacitor (SC) to store the energy harvested.
InComEss technologies, applications and services will impact the partners turnover by €100M after market up-take, generating more than 70 jobs and leveraging the EU economy to more than €4 billion and 12,000 employments and providing direct support to the realization of EU Digital Single Market and the wider implementation of IoT landscape.",1
"Title: iMETland - iMETland: A new generation of Microbial Electrochemical Wetland for effective decentralized wastewater treatment Abstract: iMETland project aims to construct and validate a full-scale application of a eco-friendly device to treat urban wastewater from small communities at zero-energy operation cost. Our concept comes from the integration of Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (MET) with the biofilters used in constructed wetlands. iMETland outperforms classical biofilters from constructed wetlands by using electroactive bacteria in combination with a innovative electroconductive material to achive depuration rates that are 10-fold higher than classical techniques. On top of that, the low biomass yield generated under electrogenic conditions avoids any bed colmatation. Wastewater will be also converted into pathogen-free water suitable for irrigation by using an electro-oxidative methodology. Furthermore, the unique conversion of sewage treatment into electric current by electricity-producing bacteria makes such a process an internal reporter of the biological depuration process. So thus, it can be used as output signal to control the process and can easily inform the operator through ICT tools, converting the depuration in an interactive process between device and a smart-phone in end-user´s hands.
iMETland try to fill the gap that was sharply identified by the programme topic: WATER-1-2014/2015: Bridging the gap: from innovative water solutions to market replication. Our solution has already passed both research and pilot scale and is ready to try a full-scale demonstration to accelerate the market uptake. The multidisciplinary nature of iMETland makes it to fit well with the “water and wastewater treatment “priority of the EIP-water. Moreover, the coordinator of iMETland consortium is also the Technical Manager of a recent ACTION GROUP at EIP-WATER called “ MEET-ME4WATER, Meeting Microbial Electrochemistry for Water”. This AG focuses on overcoming the barriers to scaling up and demonstrate microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) and bring them faster to the market.",1
"Title: BSSTD - Bioelectrochemical Sensing of Sexually Transmitted Diseases Abstract: The detection of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has become a serious medical concern around the globe, as the number of reported cases increases every year, particularly in the United Kingdom. Infection with STDs, such as Gonorrhea and Chlamydia can result in long term health issues, such as infertility, reproductive tract cancer, and poor perinatal outcome. The successful treatment of these diseases depends on a quick and reliable method of diagnosis, which will be the topic of this proposal. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a detection method for bacteria, associated with STDs, based on bioelectrochemical techniques.
Specific objectives of the proposed research consist of the identification of a redox couple functioning as electron donor for bacterial oxidases, the specific binding of bacteria to a macroelectrode, the electrochemical recognition of immobilized bacteria at the macroelectrode, testing for false-positive and false-negative results, the varying of target cultures to extend the scope of the proposed research, and finally, the assembly of a biosensing device using disposable screen printed electrodes.
The proposed technique will make use of a biochemical test for aerobic bacteria, the oxidase test, by adapting it for electrochemical detection. In doing so, high selectivity will be achieved by targeted binding of living bacteria to immobilized antibodies on an electrode, whereas sensitivity will be strongly increased through the localized electrochemical detection of the oxidase test product. To demonstrate the usefulness and applicability to medical diagnostics, an approach is proposed to transfer the presented proof of concept to portable screen printed electrodes, which will permit the routine use of this concept in a bioelectrochemical handheld device. The proposed research answers the European Commission’s call for the development of new technologies in the health sector and an urgent need in public health monitoring.",0
"Title: BUCCAC - Business Cycle Causes and Consequences Abstract: Business cycles impact on a large cross-section of the population simultaneously and matters for welfare. Gordon Brown stated in 2002: “There will be no return to boom and bust” but in 2007/08 the Global Financial Crisis triggered the Great Recession, the deepest recession since the 1930s. Mainstream macro (representative agents, complete markets, competitive/monopolistic behavior, full information) was criticized rightly or wrongly for failing to predict the crisis. But the field is now undergoing a significant change introducing financial frictions, partial information, heterogeneous agents, non-competitive behavior etc. to study macroeconomic fluctuations. This high-risk project will make fundamental contributions to this new agenda and will do so in an ambitious and unusual integrative fashion using both empirical and theoretical approaches.

The proposal has three aims each of which has several sub-projects. The first focuses on methods for dynamic causal analysis. We develop methods for dynamic causal analysis in the face of permanent and transitory shocks using external instruments. The second provides new evidence on the sources of business cycles and their propagation. We examine the dynamic macroeconomic effects of “market power” by producing a new narrative record of regulatory changes. We will also study the macroeconomic impact of expectational shocks unrelated to “fundamental” shocks. The third aim builds quantitative theory. Dynamic general equilibrium models will be used understand the impact of market power focusing on intangible customer market effects. We apply heterogeneous agents models with aggregate shocks to examine financial frictions and macro prudential regulation in models with idiosyncratic risk. We study expectations-driven fluctuations in incomplete markets models. We estimate models with incomplete markets and price rigidities which provides a contribution across the three aims.",0
"Title: U-TURBT - A revolutionary shape memory alloy-based disposable device for bladder cancer removal Abstract: Bladder cancer represents the 9th most common malignancy worldwide and the 4th most common in men. Globally approximately 2.5M people suffer from it, with 420,000 newly diagnosed cases each year. In Europe, a total of 118,000 new cases and 52,000 deaths are estimated annually. With population growth and ageing, the absolute incidence of bladder cancer might be further escalating.
Despite the increasing incidences, the current treatments remain ineffective. The gold standard Trans-Urethral Resection of Bladder Tumour (TURBT) has up to 61% risk of tumour recurrence due to incomplete removal or tumour cell implantation during the procedure.
CML introduces U-TURBT, an innovative disposable device for the treatment of bladder cancer. By covering and sealing the portion of bladder affected by the tumour, it avoids tumour cell spillage and dissemination. By minimising the risk of recurrence, U-TURBT improves patients’ health and quality of life, and cuts down the expenses of the healthcare providers relative to additional treatments.
During the feasibility assessment, a go-to-market strategy and a supply chain will be established, as well as further development plan will be drafted.  During the second phase of innovation project, CML will upgrade the device to permit en bloc bladder tumour resection and extrication. Large scale clinical trial will then be initiated for obtaining CE mark as a medical device",0
"Title: MONESE - Innovative banking model for improved financial and economic inclusion of population groups that find it difficult to open a traditional bank account Abstract: Owning a bank account has become a precondition for participating in the economic and social life of a modern society. In the EU several population groups face remarkable difficulties in accessing a bank account service: 3.5 million mobile EU residents have had bank account access issues in their target countries and 22 million consumers would like an account but have not attempted to open one. Underlying causes include practices that place non-residents at disadvantage, irregular income, inadequate documentation, and cost and slowness of opening and owning a bank account. It is estimated that the annual opportunity cost of not having a bank account is €185-365 per consumer.

Monese has launched a prototype of a mobile-first banking service that validates customer’s identity fully online, enabling access to banking even for customers with poor credit history or no formal proof of address. Account opening takes place in real-time, enabling 3-3000x faster onboarding (3 minutes). Monese aims to provide local bank accounts across European Economic Area for a transparent low-cost fixed-fee pricing (4x less expensive). The service is currently launched only in UK and has attracted >6000 customers, with 60 000 people waiting to get access.

MONESE project aims to scale up the technical capability of the service for reaching and being able to serve growing number of users – to increase the level of automation of user identification, scale up service architecture and introduce features required for EU-wide reach. Combining these innovations with business model innovation (fixed-fee pricing, streamlined value proposition, value chain deconstruction, focus on underserved people) enables to achieve EU-wide scale in a profitable manner.

Improving the access to bank account services is becoming a primary policy objective, pushing the drive for new products and business models. Development of the service to an EU-wide scale would increase Monese’s revenues by €97 million in 2020.",1
"Title: PhLEXSAT - Photo-Digital Channelizer for Flexible Digital High Throughput Satellites Abstract: Photonic technologies are key enablers to satisfy the requirements of future Terabit/s communication satellites. The ability of Photonics to handle high data rates and frequencies is critical in this scenario, where current purely RF technologies are limited in SWaP and performance. However, the use of photonics devices is currently restricted to a few demonstrations in non-critical equipment and with limited degree of integration. PhLEXSAT will increase the maturity level of several key photonic devices and modules to TRL5, designing, fabricating and testing 1) Photonic sampler, 2) ultra-low jitter photonic clock for precise sampling, 3) Photonic-assisted ADC and DAC for digital channelizers for Q/V-band operation and 4) on-board digital processing firmware. Miniaturization will be achieved by fabricating and integrating a modulator photonic integrated circuit (PIC) and high-linear photodiode PIC with electronics in the photonic ADC and DAC components. PhLEXSAT will integrate and demonstrate such building blocks in a test bed proving the suitability of the proposed architecture for Tbps-like, software defined HTS payloads with hundreds of channels with flexible bandwidth allocation up to 1GHz/channel, demonstrating a flexible photo-digital channelizer for high capacity reconfigurable payloads, enabling flexible frequency plans and channelization and dynamic coverage for Ku/Ka/Q/V operation. PhLEXSAT consortium comprises the multidisciplinary skills needed to achieve its objectives and fully exploit its results, with partners representing the whole value chain, from space-grade hardware developers to communications satellite integrators and operators. PhLEXSAT builds on the results of the previous FP7 project PHASER and is complementary to developments made by its partners in previous and existing ESA and EC Projects. PhLEXSAT success will contribute to enhance EU competitiveness and non-n-dependence by developing critical technologies for the EU satellite industry.",1
"Title: UACSURF - Understanding atmospheric circulation from a surface perspective Abstract: Circulation changes are at the heart of changes in both regional precipitation and temperature and extreme events ranging from heavy precipitation to heat waves or cold spells. Understanding and modelling circulation changes in a warming climate therefore constitutes an emerging challenge for climate science. General circulation models still struggle to represent important features of the large-scale circulation in the present-day climate, which undermines confidence in future projections. 
The present project is to combine a small-scale process-level with a large-scale dynamical perspective to investigate how drag processes at the Earth's surface associated with boundary-layer turbulence, orography and gravity waves affect large-scale circulation. Our aim is to develop a climatological view of the distribution and variability of individual components of surface drag as represented in general circulation models and to understand which processes or model parametrisations are responsible for current model biases especially in the representation of mid-latitude storm tracks.",0
"Title: Carnap and the Limits of Metaphysics - Carnap and the Limits of Metaphysics Abstract: This project’s overall objective is to use state of the art research in the formal theory of knowledge to advance our understanding of the scope and limits of metaphysics. Specifically, the project will argue that the most important threat to the value of metaphysics comes from epistemic arguments given by Carnap, and that responding to these arguments requires drawing on considerations from formal epistemology. 
The master argument that will focus this project draws on Carnap's (1928) epistemic critique of metaphysics:

1. No possible evidence can justify a metaphysical statement.
2. If no possible evidence can justify a metaphysical statement then we can have no justification to believe a metaphysical statement.
Conclusion: We can have no justification to believe a metaphysical statement.

The deliverables will be six papers published in leading journals. The first will argue that critiques of metaphysics based on semantics do not succeed. The second will argue that epistemic criticisms of metaphysics are effective, specifically Carnap's. The third will defend premise 1, arguing that the rationalist renaissance of recent years has done little to undermine the relevant empiricist thesis. The fourth defends premise 2 as applied to the question of ontology (‘what exists?’), arguing that the non-empirical considerations used by objective Bayesians can be applied to metaphysics. The fifth criticizes premise 2 as applied to the question of modality (‘what it necessary?’), arguing that non-empirical considerations cannot help us determine the gap between the necessary and the contingent. The sixth develops the anti-realist theory of modality that follows, arguing that it makes best sense of the core intuitions of both sides of the argument.
These deliverables will expand the ER's core strengths into metaphysics, re-integrate him into Europe and establish him as one of the leading European experts in formal epistemology and the methodology of metaphysics.",0
"Title: GrapheneCore1 - Graphene-based disruptive technologies Abstract: This project is the second in the series of EC-financed parts of the Graphene Flagship. The Graphene Flagship is a 10 year research and innovation endeavour with a total project cost of 1,000,000,000 euros, funded jointly by the European Commission and member states and associated countries. The first part of the Flagship was a 30-month Collaborative Project, Coordination and Support Action (CP-CSA) under the 7th framework program (2013-2016), while this and the following parts are implemented as Core Projects under the Horizon 2020 framework.

The mission of the Graphene Flagship is to take graphene and related layered materials from a state of raw potential to a point where they can revolutionise multiple industries. This will bring a new dimension to future technology – a faster, thinner, stronger, flexible, and broadband revolution. Our program will put Europe firmly at the heart of the process, with a manifold return on the EU investment, both in terms of technological innovation and economic growth.

To realise this vision, we have brought together a larger European consortium with about 150 partners in 23 countries. The partners represent academia, research institutes and industries, which work closely together in 15 technical work packages and five supporting work packages covering the entire value chain from materials to components and systems. As time progresses, the centre of gravity of the Flagship moves towards applications, which is reflected in the increasing importance of the higher - system - levels of the value chain. In this first core project the main focus is on components and initial system level tasks. 

The first core project is divided into 4 divisions, which in turn comprise 3 to 5 work packages on related topics. A fifth, external division acts as a link to the parts of the Flagship that are funded by the member states and associated countries, or by other funding sources. This creates a collaborative framework for the entire Flagship.",1
"Title: DOCUMULT - Documenting Multiculturalism: coexistence, law and multiculturalism in the administrative and legal documents of Norman and Hohenstaufen Sicily, c.1060-c.1266 Abstract: Documenting Multiculturalism will investigate comprehensively and systematically the coexistence of the diverse confessional, ethnic and linguistic communities of the island of Sicily under its Norman and Hohenstaufen rulers — Arabic-speaking Muslims and Jews, Greek Christians, and Latin Christians. It will investigate: the legal foundations upon which the coexistence of the subject communities rested; the nature, extent and results of cultural, linguistic and social interactions between them; and variation in the above, from time to time c. 1060 – c. 1266, and from place to place within the island. The ambitious objective is to create the fundamental tools to study, and to begin to write, the history of the subject communities of Norman Sicily from the bottom up, using documentary rather than narrative sources, and illustrating as far as possible the full variety in space and time.
The Project will do this by making new critical editions of all of the administrative and legal documents for Norman Sicily, in the three principal administrative languages — Arabic, Greek and Latin. These texts will populate a database, to which further data from the non-documentary sources will be added. The database will then be used to generate a series of powerful electronic research tools, which will be both the means to meet the ends of this particular project, and ends in themselves that will revolutionise the future study of all aspects of the history of Norman Sicily. At the end of the Project, a series of summative studies will document, analyse and discuss different aspects of coexistence and popular multiculturalism in Norman Sicily, and set the case of Sicily in the wider Mediterranean context.
What is distinctive about this Project is that not only the publication of its research objectives, but also the tools that it will create in order to achieve them, will revolutionise the future study of all aspects of the cultural, economic and social history of Norman Sicily.",0
"Title: LEGaTO - Low Energy Toolset for Heterogeneous Computing Abstract: Recently system integrators have dramatically increased their efforts in heterogeneous computing by integrating heterogeneous cores on die (ARM), utilizing general purpose GPUs (NVIDIA), combining CPUs and GPUs on same die (Intel, AMD), leveraging FPGAs (Altera, Xilinx), integrating CPUs with FPGAs (Xilinx), and coupling FPGAs and CPUs in the same package (IBM-Altera, Intel-Altera). Heterogeneity aims to solve the problems associated with the end of Moore´s Law by incorporating more specialized compute units in the system hardware and by utilizing the most efficient compute unit. However, while software-stack support for heterogeneity is relatively well developed for performance, software stack support for power- and energy-efficient computing it is severely lacking. Given that the ICT sector is responsible for 5% of global electricity consumption, software stack-support for energy-efficient heterogeneous computing is critical to the future growth of the ICT industry. The primary ambition of the LEGaTO project is to address this challenge by starting with a Made-in-Europe mature software stack, and by optimizing this stack to support energy-efficient computing on a commercial cutting-edge European-developed CPU-GPU-FPGA heterogeneous hardware substrate, which will lead to an order of magnitude increase in energy efficiency.",1
"Title: 5G-CORAL - 5G-CORAL: A 5G Convergent Virtualised Radio Access Network Living at the Edge Abstract: The 5G-CORAL project leverages on the pervasiveness of edge and fog computing in the Radio Access Network (RAN) to create a unique opportunity for access convergence. This is envisioned by the means of an integrated and virtualised networking and computing solution where virtualised functions, context-aware services, and user and third-party applications are blended together to offer enhanced connectivity and better quality of experience. The proposed solution contemplates two major building blocks, namely (i) the Edge and Fog computing System (EFS) subsuming all the edge and fog computing substrate offered as a shared hosting environment for virtualised functions, services, and applications; and (ii) the Orchestration and Control System (OCS) responsible for managing and controlling the EFS, including its interworking with other (non-EFS) domains (e.g., transport and core networks, distant clouds, etc.). Through the 5G-CORAL solution, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be achieved, notably an ultra-low end-to-end latency in the order of milliseconds. Moreover, new business prospects arise with new stakeholders in the value chain, notably small players owning computing and networking assets in the local service area, such as in shopping malls, airports, trains and cars. These environments will be used to validate the system in three complementary end-to-end large-scale testbeds in Taiwan, supporting innovative applications such as augmented reality, car safety, and IoT gateway.",1
"Title: SANCUS - SANCUS: analysis software scheme of uniform statistical sampling, audit and defence processes Abstract: The project involves 15 Partners from 8 European countries, and aims to design and develop an analySis software scheme of uNiform statistiCal sampling, aUdit and defence proceSses (SANCUS – an Roman god of trust). The main idea draws on formalising the logic of expressing (for the first time) the notions of cyber security and digital privacy by means of final formulas and fuse them into optimisation strategies to acquire the truly optimum defence recommendation in dynamic manner, i.e., with respect to the runtime changes of the telecommunications network environment. In this respect, SANCUS will dimension new inclusive Key Performance Indicator metric, namely, the security-vs-privacy-vs-reliability efficiency trade-off, for measuring the system network cybersecurity and privacy performance explicitly, flexibly, automatically and agnostically. To realise the heterogeneity of the security and privacy levels across the system network and its supply chain, the proposed scheme sits on six efficient engines, namely, FiV, CiV, SiD, AcE, MiU and GiO, which combine unique modelling of the Internet of Things units, cuttingedge methods for automated firmware and software validation and verification, and innovative Artificial Intelligence driven game techniques for the automated optimisation of the control and trust of digital services. Extended evaluations of the project outcomes are also considered by means of developing contemporary network testbed prototype built on latest 5G and cloud-native system setting and running three pilot use cases for examining the scheme performance across Firmware, Virtualisation and Management software layers. The SANCUS scheme will be delivered as integrated software suite and it is expected to revolutionise the European research and development efforts, in and out, the cybersecurity regime. All outcomes are planned to be audited and disseminated extensively.",1
"Title: AMPLITUDE - Advanced Multimodal Photonics Laser Imaging Tool for Urothelial Diagnosis in Endoscopy Abstract: There is an absence of lasers with the necessary wavelengths and characteristics to access the possibilities for deeper high-resolution biological tissue imaging in the third bio-window between 1650 nm and 1870 nm. Motivated by recent breakthrough results in multi-photon imaging at twice the depths currently achievable, we will meet the urgent need for new sources to address the outstanding research questions in this spectral region. Results will guide and enable instrument development in this appealing and relatively unexplored biophotonics imaging wavelength range.

The AMPLITUDE consortium proposes a new concept of label-free, multi-modal microscopy and endoscopic imaging operating in this new wavelength region with multiple imaging and spectroscopic technologies, including NIR confocal reflectance microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy.

By progressing ultrafast fibre laser developments at 1700 nm, we will deliver new imaging capabilities in an appropriate form factor and at cost suitable for widespread adoption. This will be further enhanced by providing additional output at 850 nm using second harmonic generation from one integrated laser device.

This will enable a pioneering new compact and efficient multi-modal capability combining confocal and non-linear imaging techniques, overcoming performance limitations in medical and biological imaging applications, including improved pathohistological staging of tumours and in-vivo endoscopic assessment of depth of lesion invasiveness. Deeper multi-photon microscopy with autofluorescence imaging of cellular metabolic conditions, whose aspects are tightly related to cellular functioning and to cancer, implemented in tandem with Raman spectroscopy will provide exhaustive characterisation of the examined tissue at morphological, metabolic and molecular levels, allowing in-vivo optical biopsy for bladder cancer diagnosis, grading and staging.",0
"Title: Smartphone-ANCIH - Smartphone A new concept in hearing…”: an interactive real-time embedded audio solution that offers a significant/disruptive change in hearing technology and market. Abstract: Effective hearing ability influences individuals’ overall quality of life, particularly in situations (such as in work-places, meetings, classrooms, social gatherings, or using audio devices) where unwanted noise constantly tests and challenges our audio processing capabilities. In these situations all existing hearing aids share a common underlying concept flaw due to the fixed position of the microphone and the lack of user interactivity. Coupled with inelegant and unfashionable designs, this causes many hearing-impaired individuals to opt out of using hearing aids and withdraw from these social/work group situations.
The Smartphone platform is an excellent example of technology with the potential to enhance the audio experience of individuals with hearing loss whilst blurring the distinction between hearing and consumer technologies. Combined with our innovative audio separation techniques and pioneering wireless technology, it removes the social stigma and provides a significant step change in hearing market accessibility, dispensing and affordability allowing everyone to live fuller normal lives. Auriplex’s Smartphone “A new concept in hearing…” is innovative not only in technology but also in the market reach strategy: the solution would be aimed at a new market that is distinctly different from current hearing aid offerings but at the same time will be familiar as a consumer product and a logical next step with most technology users not only in the hard-of-hearing but also in the hearing world. A disruptive innovation everyone will hear about!",1

"Title: COLEDISO - Corporate Legitimacy in Digital Society: The Role of Citizens’ Judgments in Social Media Abstract: Corporate legitimacy, defined as the social acceptance of corporate behaviour, is constructed through a process of public deliberation. In recent years, social media technologies have enabled citizens to participate in this public deliberation by discussing, critiquing, and praising corporations. Management research about corporate legitimacy, however, has so far mainly taken into account the judgments of institutional evaluators, such as news media. By drawing on communication theories and an innovative method that combines sentiment analysis with discourse analysis of social media data, this interdisciplinary research project will examine thousands of citizens’ voices and their role in the process of legitimacy construction in digital society. The Researcher will be embedded within the vibrant research environment of the ETHOS Centre at the Cass Business School of the City University London, an institution with an excellent portfolio in education that is uniquely positioned academically and geographically. The research programme will provide access to academic expertise in an interdisciplinary environment as well as new research experience and training, providing an outstanding researcher with theoretical knowledge, methodological skills, and contact networks that will enable him to develop into a key contributor to international research in the interdisciplinary field of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Thus far, the Researcher has published recent, high ranked journal publications that apply quantitative research methods. Through the acquirement and application of a qualitative method, more particularly discourse analysis, and collaboration with world-leading experts in legitimation processes, this research programme will propel the Researcher to the forefront of an interdisciplinary field emerging within management science and communication science. It will enable him to produce high quality research and to engage the general public with a lasting impact.",0
"Title: RANGER - RANGER: RAdars for loNG distance maritime surveillancE and SaR opeRations Abstract: EU trade, transport, tourism and economic development are directly dependent on open and safe seas and oceans. EU's maritime borders are widely spread including various topologies from open sea to semi-enclosed cabins with islands and islets. This poses great challenges that affect securing maritime border areas. Failing to protect against a wide array of maritime threats and risks may result in these areas becoming arenas for international conflicts, terrorism or organized crime, where smuggling, irregular immigration and drug trafficking are the most common ones. RANGER aims at re-enforcing EU by combining innovative Radar technologies with novel technological solutions for early warning, in view of delivering a surveillance platform offering detection, recognition, identification and tracking of suspicious vessels, capabilities exceeding current radar systems. It will be a platform, consisting of 2 radar technologies, a novel Over-The-Horizon Radar combined with a Multiple Input Multiple Output one implemented exploiting the latest photonics advancements, and an Early Warning System exploiting deep and adaptable machine learning schemes able to Automatically detect radar Targets. It safeguards seamless fitting and interoperability with CISE (enhanced maritime surveillance and cross border SaR operations), through the development of a CISE translation Gateway, exporting on-demand CISE services directly to end-users, by strengthening the information exchange between national authorities and the European Agency. RANGER leverages the experience of its consortium, a balanced blend of technology providers, domain experts and end-users, delivering a cost efficient, environmental friendly solution, abiding to regulations and legislation for the protection of human lives. Two pilot exercises are foreseen to thoroughly assess RANGER’s ability to deliver on its promises, enhancing its potential to become a flagship platform for the European Maritime Surveillance industry.",1

"Title: MorpheuS - Hybrid Machine Learning – Optimization techniques To Generate Structured Music Through Morphing And Fusion Abstract: State-of-the-art music generation systems (Continuator, OMax, Mimi) produce music that sounds good on a note-to-note level but lacks critical structure/direction necessary for long term coherence. To tackle this problem, we propose to generate compositions based on structural templates at varying hierarchical levels. Our novel approach deploys machine-learning methods in an optimization context to morph existing pieces into new ones and to fuse different styles.

We aim to develop a framework that combines machine learning techniques that learn style, with a powerful optimization method, the variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm, for generating music. This approach allows the learned model to incorporate a wide variety of constraints, including those for preserving long term coherence and structure. It promises to effect a step-change in automatic music generation by moving the field in the new direction of generating structured music using hybrid machine learning-optimization techniques.

The applicant is an operations researcher-musician, ideal for this work. A first step combines her VNS music generation algorithm with machine learning methods to ensure proper style evaluation. In previous work, the applicant has shown that VNS outperforms genetic algorithms when generating counterpoint with a rule-based objective function. In a preliminary study, the applicant has demonstrated the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques as evaluation metrics for optimisation methods. The applicant has extensive web development experience; to reach the widest possible audience, the resulting system will be made available in an interactive website where users can morph and fuse musical pieces.
This work is situated in the area of digital media, with a European consumer expenditure of over €33 billion in 2011, projected to increase. Music generation in digital music has direct applications in game music, interactive arts, and stock-music for advertising/videos.",0
"Title: 5G EVE - 5G European Validation platform for Extensive trials Abstract: We are at the “eve” of a fundamental transition in 5G, and the aspiration of 5G-EVE is to create the foundations for a pervasive roll-out of end-to-end 5G networks in Europe.
5G-EVE supports this fundamental transition by offering to vertical industries and to all 5GPPP Phase3 projects  facilities to validate their network KPIs and their services.
Important representatives of these vertical industries are directly involved as partners of 5G-EVE exactly to influence the design of the end-to-end 5G services, and to provide an early assessment.

The 5G-EVE end-to-end facility  consists of the interconnection of four 5G-site-facilities (France, Spain, Italy, Greece), which have been selected because of their considerable previous work with vertical industries and standardisation bodies, on top of their  5G technology competences.
5G-EVE aims at creating synergies between a significant number of facilities that will ensure sustainability and impact in terms of exploitation.

The 5G-EVE facility will enable experiments with: (a) heterogeneous access, including NR, licensed/unlicensed spectrum, advanced spectrum management; (b) Mobile Edge Computing, backhaul, core/service technologies; (c) means for site-interworking and multi-site/domain/technology slicing/orchestration.
5G-EVE will be initially compliant with 3GPP Rel. 15 and, later on, with Rel. 16.

Industrial verticals will be facilitated in the specification/analysis of experiments through: (a) intent-based, and other high-level, interfaces; (b) means for advanced 5G testing, i.e., for KPI analysis, technology benchmarking, performance diagnosis. A VNF pool, including open source and proprietary, radio/network/service, components will be developed and made available.

5G-EVE will impact standards, and has the potential and strategy for ensuring the sustainability of the facility beyond the project lifetime, therefore becoming a cornerstone of the 5G PPP programme and beyond.",1
"Title: REVOLVE - Radio Technologies for Broadband Connectivity in a Rapidly Evolving Space Ecosystem: Innovating Agility, Throughput, Power, Size and Cost Abstract: Radio signals are core to space systems and services; they are the backbone of satellite broadcasting & communications and further represent the primary underpinning technology of the nearly ubiquitous space-based radio navigation services as well as a large number of Earth observation instruments. Radio technologies are therefore central in defining the investment return for a wide range of missions and reflect to a significant fraction of the combined space and ground segment infrastructure. As the frightening rates of concurrent advances in space-related services, business models and technologies are driving the space ecosystem to a new age, the need to re-invent radio technologies for space is becoming increasingly urgent; while the sector is proactively looking for the next game changer, a whole new class of emerging and forecasted missions place urgent demands for drastic reduction in cost with a concurrent radical improvement in throughput, agility, volume/mass and power consumption. 
This paradigm shift dictates an acute need of highly trained researchers and engineers with a broad set of skills and abilities that extend across and beyond conventional boundaries, enabling them to re-think current approaches and pioneer fresh concepts and radio technologies for space. Recognising this urgent need, REVOLVE brings together a world-leading consortium of 4 industrial and 2 academic beneficiaries aiming to challenge conventional practice in a training network formed around the following five pillars; P1: excellent science & engineering; P2: cross-fertilisation within and between sectors and technologies; P3: application-focused R&D; P4: innovation-centred training, and; P5: promote career acceleration and fulfil personal potential.",1
"Title: EuroLab-4-HPC - EuroLab-4-HPC: Foundations of a European Research Center of Excellence in High Performance Computing Systems Abstract: Europe has built momentum in becoming a leader in large parts of the HPC ecosystem. It has
brought together technical and business stakeholders from application developers via system software
to exascale systems. Despite such gains, excellence in high performance computing systems is often
fragmented and opportunities for synergy missed.
To compete internationally, Europe must bring together the best research groups to tackle the longterm
challenges for HPC. These typically cut across layers, e.g., performance, energy efficiency and
dependability, so excellence in research must target all the layers in the system stack. 

The EuroLab-4-HPC project's bold overall goal is to build connected and sustainable leadership in high-performance
computing systems by bringing together the different and leading performance orientated communities
in Europe, working across all layers of the system stack and, at the same time, fuelling new industries

"Title: GSTHgNDD - Role of GST gene variation in susceptibility to mercury (Hg)-induced neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) in zebrafish Abstract: Environmental factors, including the heavy metal mercury, are recognized as having a dominant influence on the aetiology and prevalence of neurodevelopmental behavioural disorders. This proposal will develop a new model for assessing the role of gene:environment interactions, specifically genetic predisposition for toxicity, in risk for disease, and identify early markers predictive of toxicity and later phenotypes. This will directly relate to the EC work program for Health, demographic change and wellbeing, with respect to both 'Personalized medicine' for non-communicable diseases and 'Early development' addressing mental health from childhood to older ages. The project uses the zebrafish model to investigate the relationship between glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-related genetic background, developmental exposure to mercury, and risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. This will be achieved by exposure of wild-type and CRISPR-generated Gst mutant embryos to mercury, and testing whether genetic predisposition leads to increased risk for toxin-induced behavioural phenotypes. We will test for altered biochemical, transcriptomic and epigenomic modifications that may serve as potential early markers for insult. The results obtained in this proposal will have significant impact on the ability to conduct individual and population specific toxicity risk assessment, and may lead to novel measures for early detection of increased risk and alleviation of potential adverse outcomes. The high-quality original research presented in the proposal will not only enable the Experienced Researcher to reach a position of professional maturity in her career, but will also allow her to develop a spectrum of new and interdisciplinary skills, integrating her previous training and knowledge into the behavioural genetics skills set. This project will also allow Dr. Brennan's group to integrate developmental toxicology into existing behavioural research, and will generate new collaborations.",0
"Title: GPR84 - Biased Agonism of GPR84 as a Novel Dual Anti-inflammatory and Pro-repair Mechanism Abstract: Elevated local and systemic inflammation has been shown to play a central role in multiple diseases. An important cellular mechanism leading to chronic increased inflammation is dysregulation of the innate immune system. A drug that modulates macrophage function, suppressing the pro-inflammatory response while maintaining pro-repair function would represent a major breakthrough in the treatment of multiple degenerative diseases.
Our host group very recently identified a biased agonist of an immunometabolic receptor, GPR84, which failed to induce chemotaxis (pro-inflammatory response) while stimulating phagocytosis (pro-repair response) in both murine and human macrophage (ACS Chem. Biol. 2019). This is an important discovery of a small molecule along with a defined molecular target and cellular mechanism which, for the first time, is capable of blocking a pro-inflammatory response while stimulating a pre-repair response in both mouse and human macrophage. 
These results are extremely exciting and demonstrate the translational potential of our approach, but the small molecule they identified, while a useful in vitro tool which we have shared with the scientific community, cannot be progressed to in vivo proof-of-concept experiments because it is too metabolically unstable. We are therefore applying to the MSCA IF to seek medicinal chemistry support to drive a hit-to-lead project to evolve our small molecule hit into a lead candidate with appropriate properties for progression in vivo to carry out key proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of inflammation. This in vivo efficacy data will be pivotal to underpin a future funding application to support drug discovery and development campaigns.",0
"Title: MNEMOSENE - Computation-in-memory architecture based on resistive devices Abstract: ""The MNEMOSENE project aims at demonstrating a new computation-in-memory (CIM) based on resistive devices together with its required programming flow and interface. To develop the new architecture, the following scientific and technical objectives will be targeted:

• Improve the energy-delay product by factor of 100X to 1000X
• Improve the computational efficiency (#operations / total-energy) by factor of 10X to 100X
• Improve the performance density (# operations per area) by factor of 10X to 100X""",1
"Title: openMOS - Open dynamic Manufacturing Operating System for Smart Plug-and-Produce Automation Components Abstract: Higher agility for the European Manufacturing Industry is the main MOTIVATION for the openMOS project. While automated systems are appealing to achieve high productivity and quality requirements, their sensitivity to change is becoming increasingly a bottleneck to substantial reduction of lot sizes and more frequent change-overs. 
The project VISION is to enable full economic sustainability of the production systems based on intelligent modular plug-and-produce equipment. To achieve this, it is focusing on three main innovation strands: 1) embedding plug-and-produce capabilities into automation devices, robots and machines, 2) enabling vertical and horizontal connectivity between plug-and-produce automation components and higher level control and business functions, and 3) creating a easily extendable and adaptable manufacturing operating system (MOS) that permits the easy introduction of new products, work orders and changes in the equipment and allows easy deployment of optimisation and changeover management strategies. The targeted INNOVATION is a common, openly accessible plug-and-produce system platform which allows all stakeholders in the automation system value chain to come together and jointly develop and exploit solutions. Therefore, the project is proposing to integrate well established plug-and-produce system concepts from many years of research in this field, into industrial-relevant technology platforms which have emerged in recent years. 
As the vast majority of components/ devices/ machine manufacturers and system integrators are SMEs, plug-and-produce can only be achieved by placing specific SME requirements at the forefront: solutions by, and for, SMEs.
The RTD approach will be driven by proposed industrial scenarios and pilot implementations which will be carried out to systematically test and validate the readiness of the targeted exploitable results in three key industrial sectors (white goods, automotive and electronics).",0
"Title: HV-EPSA - High Voltage Electrical Power System Architecture Abstract: The main objective of the HV-EPSA project is to break the current state-of-the-art in satellite electrical & power subsystem, expand the present application domain of the classical technologies and perform a full system analysis and validation to optimize the electrical chain including the new electrical propulsion units and communication systems

The electrical & power subsystem (EPS) is mainly devoted to provide electrical power to all the active systems of a satellite. It generates and distributes a “primary power bus” whose characteristics are optimized to the mission needs. This bus is usually generated from solar arrays and electrochemical batteries. These power sources are controlled by a Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) which delivers the power bus. EPS is a major constituent of a satellite : its cost may reach up to 30% of the total platform cost.

There is a large design variety of power buses, with voltage levels typically ranging from 28 to 100V. This state-of-the-art is well adapted to past and current needs in term of power conditioning & distribution for science and telecommunication satellites. Nevertheless, a short-term need is raising for higher operating voltages, especially for the new electrical propulsion systems and high power payloads

Increasing the bus voltage represents a real technical challenge. During its life, the satellite has to face many “harsh” environment constraints (radiations, pressure, plasma,…) which limit the choice of high voltage electronic parts and favor destructive electrical discharges or arcs. This study will consider: solar arrays, power conditioning and distribution units (PCDU), cables and connectors, up to the main driving units for high voltage feeds: the EPCs (Electrical Power Conditioner for radio frequency amplifiers  supply) and PPUs (Plasma Propulsion Unit for electric thrusters).

This study will enable a full system analysis including units optimization and materials testing within representative environment.",1
"Title: TRAFIG - Transnational Figurations of Displacement: Connectivity and Mobility as Solutions to Protracted Refugee Situations Abstract: TRAFIG introduces a novel perspective on protracted displacement situations (PDS) that will improve the protection and resilience of refugees and enhance trust and cooperation between refugees and host communities. It considers the transnational and local connectivity of displaced people and host communities as well as their capability of mobility as socioeconomic and socio-psychological resources that displaced people use and upon which their resilience relies. The project will develop a rapid assessment tool to identify the most vulnerable groups in PDS and to analyse interactions between displaced and host communities. As an evidence-based tool for creating impact, it will support policymakers and practitioners to enhance the self-reliance of displaced people as well as host-refugees relations through tailored programming and policy development. We closely cooperate with key stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of the project. Our research is based on a novel concept of transnational figurations of displacement that combines the figuration model – a meso-level approach emphasizing the networks of interdependent human beings – with the transnationalism approach and state-of-the-art knowledge on forced displacement. Through comparative empirical research, both qualitative and quantitative, in camps and urban settings at sites in Asia, Africa, and Europe, TRAFIG will answer the following questions:  (1) How do displaced people gain access to and make use of humanitarian and migration policies and programmes?  (2) Why and how do displaced people live in vulnerable situations and sustain their livelihoods? How can policy support their self-reliance? (3) How do transnational networks shape refugees’ experiences and trajectories? (4) Which processes structure relations between displaced people and host communities? (5) What are the medium and long-term economic impacts of PDS?",0
"Title: Instand-NGS4P - Integrated and standardized NGS workflows for Personalised therapy Abstract: Instand-NGS4P is a 65-month PCP project federating 7 leading medical centers (two are coordinating ERNs) as buyers’ group with major experience in using different NGS platforms in research and routine diagnostics. The consortium is further strengthened by European patient advocacy groups, a standardization organization and partners participating in the European infrastructures BBMRI-ERIC, ELIXIR as well as several NGS-related EU programs to cover all technical aspects and transversal needs & requirements. Driven by patient and clinical needs, innovative NGS workflows from sample-pre-analytics to medical decision making will be developed. The modular design of the workflow will particularly enable SEMs to contribute, and provides flexibility to adopt emerging user needs and technologies. Specifications will address regulatory requirements for IVDs and refer to international standards and requests development of reference materials and implementation of EQA schemes covering the whole workflow.

At the end, this PCP will provide 2 fully integrated, standardized NGS workflows for routine diagnostics of common and rare cancers from adults to children. In order to enable broad implementation in healthcare systems throughout Europe and beyond and to increase benefit to patients a series of support activities are planned including communication and dissemination activities targeting a broad stakeholder community, development of training and education material for healthcare professionals and patients, health economic assessment and engagement with healthcare payers and policy makers.",0
"Title: MITIGATE - Multidimensional, IntegraTed, rIsk assessment framework and dynamic, collaborative Risk ManaGement tools for critical information infrAstrucTurEs Abstract: Despite the importance of Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) and dynamic ICT-based maritime supply chains (SCs) for port operations, state-of-the-art Risk Management (RM) methodologies for maritime environments pay limited attention to cyber-security and do not adequately address security processes for international SCs. Motivated by these limitations, MITIGATE will introduce, integrate, validate and commercialize a novel RM system, which will empower stakeholders’ collaboration for the identification, assessment and mitigation of risks associated with cyber-security assets and SC processes. This collaborative system will boost transparency in risk handling, while enabling the generation of unique evidence about risk assessment and mitigation. At the heart of the RM system will be an open simulation environment enabling stakeholders to simulate risks and evaluate risk mitigation actions. This environment will allow users to model, design, execute and analyze attack-oriented simulations. Emphasis will be paid on the estimation of cascading effects in SCs, as well as on the prediction of future risks. MITIGATE will be compliant with prominent security standards and regulations for the maritime sector (i.e. ISO27000, ISO28000, ISPS).
The MITIGATE system will be built based on readily available technologies of the partners, which will enable the project to produce a mature (high-TRL) system at an optimal value-for-money. The system will be validated based on real-life pilot operations across five EU ports (Bremen, Piraeus, Valencia, Ravenna, Livorno) with the active participation of over 500 users (security officers, terminal operators, facility operators, standardization experts and more). Also, the project’s approach will be contributed as a blueprint to the NIS public-private platform. Finally, significant effort will be devoted to the commercialization of the MITIGATE system based on pragmatic business plans and market launch actions.",0
"Title: TankRob - In-service intrusive Non-Destructive Testing of above ground and underground petrochemical storage tank floors and walls to detect corrosion Abstract: It is estimated that 20% of storage tank accidents are caused by cracks or raptures on the tank structure. The majority of the bulk liquids stored in these tanks include crude oil and derived products which are extremely hazardous to the environment; a spill of only one gallon of oil can contaminate a million gallons of water.
Storage tank NDT inspection is very costly and degrading to the environment. Tank operators need to clear and vent the tank in order for human inspectors to enter it; a process that takes approximately 4 weeks and costs more than €500k while it causes hazardous gases to be released into the atmosphere.
There is currently no inspection solution allowing for low-cost and 100% surface tank inspection. It is this gap that gives rise to unique business opportunity which InnotecUK (Dynamic robotic NDT solution provider), Technic-Control and Integrity NDT (Leading NDT instrument and service providers) aspire to seize with the aid of TWI (World-class NDT technique research organization) and LSBIC (Leading robotic control research institute).
Our vision is clear; we aim to redefine storage tank NDT inspection by commercializing TankRob, a leading-edge NDT inspection robot capable of in-service operation and 100% surface coverage thanks to a specially designed surface changing mechanism.
TankRob’s operation has already been demonstrated in water tanks and its performance indicates tremendous potential. We now need to finalize the system’s commercial version, obtain the necessary certifications and validate its performance in oil storage tanks. Our primary target customers will be large storage tank operators and SME NDT service providers initially in  European, Asian and Middle-eastern markets.
To this end we have come together as a consortium pursuing €3m funding. Our goal is to grow our businesses by €202.86m in gross sales resulting €39.47m of profit over the 10 years after our product’s market launch, translating to a total amount of 897 new jobs.",0
"Title: NETLAS - NExt generation of Tuneable LASers for optical coherence tomography Abstract: The main objective of this Innovative Training Network (ITN) is to educate 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESR) towards PhD through a joint interdisciplinary research programme.

"Title: AUTOSTEM - Development of closed, scalable and AUTOmated robotic systems for therapeutic STEM cell manufacturing: aseptic systems from “Donor-to-Patient” Abstract: AUTOSTEM will develop closed, scaleable and automated systems for therapeutic cell manufacture.  The project vision is a donor-to-patient system where all aspects of processing, from tissue harvest to patient delivery are fully closed and aseptic. The process will involve new methods of biological cell selection from marrow, fat or other tissues, bioreactors to achieve scale and media formulations that are fully xeno-free. Process monitoring will utilise remote sensing and the automated retrieval of cells for microscopy, flow cytometry, karyotyping, differentiation or other tests. The final product will be a cryobag containing a specified cell dose, ready for thawing and clinical delivery.

AUTOSTEM will be the factory of the future for therapeutic cell manufacturing. This system could ultimately be scaled for hospital-based use to produce autologous cells or at industrial scale for allogeneic therapy. It will achieve consistent cell production, minimise contamination, maximise scale and reduce cost of goods, thus enabling routine clinical use of cell therapies.

"Title: SETA - SETA: An open, sustainable, ubiquitous data and service ecosystem for efficient, effective, safe, resilient mobility in metropolitan areas Abstract: Around 50% of the global population lives in metropolitan areas, and this is expected to grow to 75% by 2050. Mobility within these areas is complex as it involves multiple modalities of transport, multiple managing authorities, as well as several millions of citizens. The cost of inefficiency in transport and mobility are enormous. For example, inefficiency costs the UK economy €5.8 billion each year. €583 million is wasted on fuel (e.g. traffic congestion) alone each year, which attributes to increased urban pollution and CO2. Hold-ups to business or freight vehicles amounts to €1.5bn annually.
Mobility generates huge amounts of data thought thousands of sensors, city cameras, and connected cars, as well as millions of citizens connected through their mobile devices. If properly managed, this data can be used to understand, optimise and manage mobility and make it more efficient, sustainable and resilient. 
SETA will address this challenge, creating a technology and methodology able to use this wealth of data to change the way mobility is organised, monitored and planned in large metropolitan areas. The solution will be able to collect, process, link and fuse high-volume, high-velocity, multi-dimensional, heterogeneous, cross-media, cross-sectorial data and to use it to model mobility with a precision, granularity and dynamicity that is impossible with today’s technologies. Such models will be the basis of pervasive services to citizens and business, as well as decision makers to support safe, sustainable, effective, efficient and resilient mobility.
The project has the potential to impact the everyday lives of millions of people, their health and the environment with enormous financial and social impact. 
SETA’s solution will be evaluated rigorously by citizens, business and decision makers in 3 cities across Europe. 
The proposal includes a commercialisation plan and describes the economy of managing the SETA ecosystem in a metropolitan area.",1
"Title: Noke - A ground-breaking smart-lock for industrial storage, utilizing patented technology through Bluetooth 4.0, mobile apps, and a cloud platform. Abstract: """"""Current day traditional locks, though proving hardy throughout the years, have simply come short when seeking to address problems and needs, especially on a large commercial wide-scale. This include multiple key management, losing of keys, non-keeping track of key copies and the different hands the keys end up in, specific personnel access control, and mechanically venerable locks susceptible to lock picking and jacking, among other issues.
Enter the Noke, a cylinder smart lock (Noke) that functions as a high security digital lock utilising smart Bluetooth technology, controlled through a mobile app connected to the cloud. It enables the convenient opening of locks without requiring physical keys, provides access control, thorough material/electronic security protection, and enables enterprise level tracking allowing adoption for mass commercial use.
The global Internet of Things market will grow to € 1.5T in 2020 from € 583B in 2014, with the global smart lock market will grow from € 234M today to € 3.2B by 2019 alone. As of current none of them are addressing commercial and industrial enterprise specifically.

"Title: SEAMLESS - Services based on Ecosystem data AssiMiLation: Essential Science and Solutions Abstract: The ocean provides us with vital climate and food services by absorbing 30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions and supplying 17% of animal proteins to the world’s population. However, we are still far from accurately estimating these services using the state-of-the-art operational models at the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Monitoring and Forecasting Centres (MFCs).
The main aim of SEAMLESS is to provide CMEMS MFCs with unprecedented capabilities to deliver indicators of climate-change impacts and food security in ocean ecosystems, such as particulate carbon export and plankton phenology.
The central hypothesis of SEAMLESS is that new ensemble data assimilation methods can better estimate crucial ecosystem indicators by integrating the new generation of European Copernicus satellite observations and in-situ ocean data. Specifically, our approach will link coherently biogeochemical and hydrodynamic simulations. The hypothesis is supported by our previous work, in which we improved the MFCs’ model simulations of the plankton stocks at the base of the marine food web by assimilating biogeochemical and physical data from satellites, Biogeochemical-Argo floats and gliders. 
SEAMLESS will develop a new assimilation prototype that will expand simulations to plankton dynamics and related biogeochemical processes, e.g., plankton phenology and carbon export. This prototype will be disseminated to CMEMS stakeholders and the wider oceanographic community. To guarantee the integration of SEAMLESS into CMEMS, we have assembled a team with outstanding expertise and track records for all the key project components, which includes CMEMS MFC core developers, and will be supported by policy, blue-growth and academic stakeholders. On project completion, six CMEMS MFCs will be able to add new and improved products on water quality, carbon cycle and trophic webs to their portfolios, ultimately allowing users to exploit more sustainably ocean ecosystem services.",1
"Title: AUTOPILOT - AUTOmated driving Progressed by Internet Of Things Abstract: ""Automated driving is expected to increase safety, provide more comfort and create many new business opportunities for mobility services. The market size is expected to grow gradually reaching 50% of the market in 2035. 
The IoT is about enabling connections between objects or """"things""""; it’s about connecting anything, anytime, anyplace, using any service over any network. There is little doubt that these vehicles will be part of the IoT revolution. Indeed, connectivity and IoT have the capacity for disruptive impacts on highly and fully automated driving along all value chains towards a global vision of Smart Anything Everywhere.
In order to stay competitive, the European automotive industry is investing in connected and automated driving with cars becoming moving “objects” in an IoT ecosystem eventually participating in BigData for Mobility. AUTOPILOT brings IoT into the automotive world to transform connected vehicles into highly and fully automated vehicle.
The well-balanced AUTOPILOT consortium represents all relevant areas of the IoT eco-system. IoT open vehicle platform and an IoT architecture will be developed based on the existing and forthcoming standards as well as open source and vendor solutions. Thanks to AUTOPILOT, the IoT eco-system will involve vehicles, road infrastructure and surrounding objects in the IoT, with a particular attention to safety critical aspects of automated driving. AUTOPILOT will develop new services on top of IoT to involve autonomous driving vehicles, like autonomous car sharing, automated parking, or enhanced digital dynamic maps to allow fully autonomous driving.
AUTOPILOT IoT enabled autonomous driving cars will be tested, in real conditions, at four permanent large scale pilot sites in Finland, France, Netherlands and Italy, whose test results will allow multi-criteria evaluations (Technical, user, business, legal) of the IoT impact on pushing the level of autonomous driving.

"Title: WORTECS - Wireless Optical/Radio TErabit Communications Abstract: 5G promises increased connectivity, high data rates, and ultimately new services. The first 5G release standard in 3GPP will be available by June 2018 with pre-commercial deployment in Korea soon after. Whilst 5G will meet current demand, the exponential rise in demand for wireless connectivity will ultimately require Tbps connectivity in indoor spaces. The future network will use an all optical fibre core, and an ultra-high data rate wireless ‘bridge’ to the User.

WORTECS focuses on the goal of ultra-high data rate wireless. High-frequency mm-wave (in the band above 90 GHz) radio communications will be combined with optical wireless communications in the infrared and visible regions of the optical spectrum, using novel heterogeneous networking concepts. A compelling virtual reality application will be used to showcase the capability of the WORTECS network. The project will deliver two Proof-of-Concept demonstrations. An ultra-high density LiFi/Radio network providing multi-Gbps to virtual reality terminals will be developed, and an ultra-high data rate Proof-of-Concept capable of Tbps networking will also be targeted.

WORTECS brings together innovative, world leading LiFi SMEs Oledcomm (France) and PureLiFi (UK), Global telecommunications operator Orange (France) and research institutes BCOM (France) and IHP (Germany). These are joined by university research leaders in optical wireless communications from the University of Oxford (UK) and the University of Las Palmas (Spain). The consortium has the dual ambition of proposing new scientific solutions beyond 5G while transferring these technologies from research labs to industrial world. A successful project will both showcase technologies required to alleviate the radio spectrum crunch, and provide substantial benefits to EU citizens through the exploitation of results by WORTECS commercial partners.",1
"Title: FORGE - Development of novel and cost-effective coatings for high-energy processing applications Abstract: ""The FORGE project has been specified as necessary by our energy-intensive industrial members, who, in order to intensify and update their future processes, need to improve equipment capability to withstand corrosion, erosion and brittle failures from gas collection and kiln operations, to maintain the equipment’s up-time and production efficiency.    Current materials used in these exceptionally harsh environments, (and the corresponding design models) are not capable of robustly resisting degradation, leading to the constant need to inspect and repair damage.  The FORGE project will train a machine-learning model to guide high-throughput experiments, to develop novel high performance coatings of targeted “Compositionally Complex Alloys"""" and Ceramic counterparts, to be applied to the key specified vulnerable process stages (eg CO2 capture and waste heat recovery pipework, heat exchangers, kiln refractories) in response to the specific degradation forces we find at each point.  We will also capture the underlying principles of the material resistance, to proactively design the equipment for performance while minimising overall capex costs from these new alloys.   The FORGE consortium has industrial user members from steel, cement, aluminium and ceramic industries and specialist materials, to ensure the project's focus on real-world issues, coupled with world-leading experience in the development of materials, protective coatings and their application to harsh environments.  In addition to developing the new coating materials and techniques, we also aim to provide a new overarching set of design paradigms and generate an underpinning Knowledge Based System to inform this and future work in other energy intensive industries.""",0
"Title: GHOST - Galileo EnHancement as BoOster of the Smart CiTies Abstract: With the increase of the density of people in urban areas, modern cities experience significant needs related to planning, maintenance and administration. As a result, many cities are engaged in massive investment for infrastructure development across many structural elements including water supply, lighting, maintenance, traffic and transportation systems, refuse disposal and all the factors which form a part of the completed city.

The public transportation systems, assisting the movement of people in urban areas using group travel technologies such as buses and trains, are continuously evolving in terms of areas coverage, comfort and technology. Such systems can be exploited by the cities in order to serve both public and benefits including:
• Maintenance of infrastructure such as lighting, road deteriorations etc.
• Inspection of points of interests such as parking spaces, garbage collection points etc.
• Provision of services to the private sector such as inspection of advertisement points etc.

The main objective of the GHOST project is to design, develop and validate at an operational environment a GALILEO-based intelligent system for vehicles in order to take advantage of the public transportation fleet routes, towards enabling development of new cross-functional applications for infrastructures maintenance, street parking and garbage management in smarter cities environment.

The GHOST intelligent system will be validated at an operational environment, by demonstrating and experimenting on three (3) use cases of the GHOST applications including:
• Reporting of street lighting anomalies or road deteriorations (ex: pothole).
• Detection of double parking or occupied parking reserved for disabled drivers by unauthorized vehicles.
• Monitoring of public garbage completion level.",1
"Title: NARRATIVENSCIENCE - Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives Abstract: The aim of this project is to understand the role of narrative in modern science. Narratives have appeared in many places in the human, social and natural sciences over the past two centuries. They can be found both in accounts of real situations and in simulations of virtual situations, in empirical work and in theorizing. It is clear that narratives have played important roles for scientists well beyond the simple act of reporting. Yet we lack an account of what kinds of thing scientists know from using narrative and how such ‘narrative knowing’ is constituted. Indeed, with the notable exceptions of medicine and evolutionary biology, even the study of those field narratives, as narratives, has been largely ignored by both historians of science and narrative scholars.
What do scientists gain from using narratives, what functions do narratives play? Initial research shows that scientists have used narratives to figure out what fits together with what, and to create coherence amongst the elements in their research.  But the means of such ordering vary - from site to site, and from science to science. Narratives used to explore a path dependent system in nineteenth century biology used a different mode of ordering both from the configuring narratives of mid-twentieth century case studies in sociology, and from the ‘how possibly’ narratives of modern computer-based simulations. Such variety requires a broad project, using many case studies to explore the critical role that scientists’ narratives have played in modern science. Making sense of such variety offers an ambitious challenge. But while there is surely no simple answer to why scientists use narratives, all these notions of narrative ordering do have something in common. They suggest that narratives function not just to describe and report as one might expect, they play a much more important role in answering scientists’s own questions and so - in various ways - in providing scientific explanations.",0
"Title: PriMO-5G - Virtual Presence in Moving Objects through 5G Abstract: The PriMO-5G project addresses the area of “a) Focus on mmWave and super broadband services” in the call “EUK-02-2018: 5G” of the Horizon 2020 Work Program 2018-2020. 

The main aim of the PriMO-5G project is to demonstrate an end-to-end 5G system providing immersive video services for moving objects. This will be done by cross-continental testbeds that integrate radio access and core networks developed by different project partners. The cross-continental testbeds will show the end-to-end operations of envisaged use cases. To achieve this aim, the PriMO-5G project will develop a set of solutions enabling the ultra-high data rate services for fast-moving cars and drones. The development includes mmWave radio technologies, interoperable 5G core networks, and AI-assisted communications. 

The project contributes to the standardization of 5G Phase 2 and beyond, identifies possible regulatory bottlenecks that need to be solved in order to enable the system to operate globally, assesses the economic and business aspects related to the use of 5G for immerse video service in vehicular and aerial drone settings. The consortium benefits from leading industrial partners both in Europe and Korea who are active key members of major standardization fora, regulatory bodies, and open source communities. Academic partners will also influence the spectrum policies through national regulatory authorities. 

The PriMO-5G  consortium members represent the full range of competence and expertise covering the whole value chain in a complementary way to achieve the project’s objectives. The consortium draws on skills from world-leading manufacturers, competent operator, top universities, and innovative SMEs in Europe and Korea, thus ensuring close cooperation and balanced effort between the two regions. The project will foster a long-term partnership between the two regions, which will help Europe and Korea retain the competitive edge in the fierce global 5G competition.",1
"Title: FoodSMART - Shaping Smarter Consumer Behaviour and Food Choice Abstract: Compared to meals prepared at home, meals eaten out tend to contain more calories, total fat and saturated fat and it is here where the consumer has very little control or knowledge of the nutrient profile of the food they are eating (Bohm and Quartuccio, 2008). The positive association between the rise in consumption of food prepared outside the home and the increasing prevalence of obesity has been described as a major health and wellbeing societal challenge. Attempts to increase public awareness of appropriate ways to eat more healthily unfortunately do not seem to have led to significant changes in patterns of food purchase and consumption especially from an eating ‘out-of-home’ situation. It has become obvious that the development of effective measures for improvement requires further systematic research and a radical approach. The aim of FoodSMART is to develop an innovative technical (ICT) menu solution that enables informed consumer choice when eating out that takes into account individual characteristics (such as culture, dietary requirements and age group) as well as product (specification) and environmental cues (choice architecture and consumption setting). 
This aim will be achieved through the evaluation of consumer orientated intelligence (what information consumers require/trust i.e. information quality); the assessment of industry orientated intelligence (impact of customisation) and the subsequent development of data analytics and Quick Recognition (QR) coding for personalised food recommendation; thereby, facilitating the consumption of healthy and appropriate dishes. Results will be gathered and modelled to provide strategic intelligence for menu design and decision-making (by Industry) and for policy purposes (by the EU); further, this translational research will be disseminated both at scientific and consumer levels. Increasing the pace and scale of innovation within out-of-home eating is fundamental to this proposal.",0
"Title: Fiware4Water - FIWARE for the Next Generation Internet Services for the WATER sector Abstract: ""FIWARE is a smart solution platform, funded by the EC (2011-16) as a major flagship PPP, to support SMEs and developers in creating the next generation of internet services, as the main ecosystem for Smart City initiatives for cross-domain data exchange/cooperation and for the NGI initiative. So far little progress has been made on developing specific water-related applications using FIWARE, due to fragmentation of the water sector, restrained by licensed platforms and lagging behind other sectors (e.g. telecommunications) regarding interoperability, standardisation, cross-domain cooperation and data exchange. 
Fiware4Water intends to link the water sector to FIWARE by demonstrating its capabilities and the potential of its interoperable and standardised interfaces for both water sector end-users (cities, water utilities, water authorities, citizens and consumers), and solution providers (private utilities, SMEs, developers). 
Specifically we will demonstrate it is non-intrusive and integrates well with legacy systems. In addition to building modular applications using FIWARE and open API architecture for the real time management of water systems, Fiware4Water also builds upon distributed intelligence and low level analytics (smart meters, advanced water quality sensors) to increase the economic (improved performance) and societal (interaction with the users, con-consensus) efficiency of water systems and social acceptability of digital water, by adopting a 2-Tier approach: (a) building and demonstrating four Demo Cases as complementary and exemplary paradigms across the water value chain (Tier#1); (b) promoting an EU and global network of followers, for digital water and FIWARE (cities, municipalities, water authorities, citizens, SMEs, developers) with three complementary Demo Networks (Tier#2).

"Title: ChaperoneRegulome - ChaperoneRegulome: Understanding cell-type-specificity of chaperone regulation Abstract: Protein misfolding causes devastating health conditions such as neurodegeneration. Although the disease-causing protein is widely expressed, its misfolding occurs only in certain cell-types such as neurons. What governs the susceptibility of some tissues to misfolding is a fundamental question with biomedical relevance. 
Molecular chaperones help cellular proteins fold into their native conformation. Despite the generality of their function, chaperones are differentially expressed across various tissues. Moreover exposure to misfolding stress changes chaperone expression in a cell-type-dependent manner. Thus cell-type-specific regulation of chaperones is a major determinant of susceptibility to misfolding. The molecular mechanisms governing chaperone levels in different cell-types are not understood, forming the basis of this proposal. We will take a multidisciplinary approach to address two key questions: (1) How are chaperone levels co-ordinated with tissue-specific demands on protein folding? (2) How do different cell-types regulate chaperone genes when exposed to the same misfolding stress?
Cellular chaperone levels and their response to misfolding stress are both driven by transcriptional changes and influenced by chromatin. The proposed work will bring the conceptual, technological and computational advances of chromatin/ transcription field to understand chaperone biology and misfolding diseases. Using in vivo mouse model and in vitro differentiation model, we will investigate molecular mechanisms that control chaperone levels in relevant tissues. Our work will provide insights into functional specialization of chaperones driven by tissue-specific folding demands. We will develop a novel and ambitious approach to assess protein-folding capacity in single cells moving the chaperone field beyond state-of-the-art. Thus by implementing genetic, computational and biochemical approaches, we aim to understand cell-type-specificity of chaperone regulation.",0

Two key commercial insulating products:
• Highly insulating mono-component and environmentally friendly spray foam, EENSULATE foam, for the cost-effective automated manufacturing and insulation of the opaque components of curtain walls as well as for the significant reduction of thermal bridges during installation (SELENA and EVONIK in cooperation with ULSTER);
• Lightweight and thin double pane vacuum glass, EENSULATE glass, for the insulation of the transparent component of curtain walls, manufactured through an innovative low temperature process using polymeric flexible adhesives and distributed getter technology, thus allowing to use both annealed and tempered glass as well as low emissivity coatings (AGC, SAES and TVITEC in cooperation with ULSTER and UNIVPM ). A multi-functional thermo-tunable coating will allow for dynamic solar gain control as well as anti-fogging and self-cleaning properties (AGC in cooperation with UCL).

"Title: p-TYPE - Transparent p-type semiconductors for efficient solar energy capture, conversion and storage. Abstract: This proposal will develop new transparent p-type semiconductors that will make dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) a vastly more efficient and a realistic prospect for carbon-free energy generation worldwide. Two key challenges will be addressed: (1) a means of converting NIR radiation to increase the amount of sunlight utilised from 35% to over 70%; (2) a means of storing the energy. Almost all the research in the field is based on dye or “perovskite” sensitized TiO2 (n-type) solar cells, which are limited by their poor spectral response in the red-NIR. pTYPE approaches the problem differently: tandem DSCs will be developed which combine a n-type and a p-type DSC in a single p/n device. This increases the theoretical efficiency from 33% to 43% by extending the spectral response without sacrificing the voltage. The device will be modified with catalysts to convert H2O or CO2 and sunlight into fuel without using sacrificial reagents that limit the efficiency of current systems. An efficient tandem DSC has not yet been developed because p-type DSCs are much less efficient than n-type cells. As an independent Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin fellow I increased the photocurrent by developing new dyes. This project will exploit this breakthrough by increasing the voltage, which is currently limited by the NiO semiconductor conventionally used. I will rapidly synthesise libraries of alternative p-type semiconductors; select promising candidates based on key criteria which can be measured on a single sample within minutes: transparency and dye adsorption (for high light harvesting efficiency by the dye), conductivity (for high charge collection efficiency) and valence band potential (for high voltage); assemble the new materials in tandem DSCs. As one of the few researchers experienced in preparing, characterising and optimising each aspect of this photoelectrochemical system, I aim to match the efficiency from TiO2 with p-type DSCs to obtain tandem efficiencies above 20%.",0
"Title: OxfordNano - Implementing Special Nanomaterials in Ultra-performance Mobile Radomes Abstract: OxfordNano aims to enhance the EU manufacturing capability in aerospace composite structures using special nanomaterials (NMs) technology derived from ERC research. The target application for this capability is ultra-performance radomes for airborne sensors systems and a growing opportunity to deliver digital services to users on the move e.g. passengers in civil aircraft and trains.
Mobile radomes for the aviation industries need to be strong in structure and impact, lightweight and easily formed to aerodynamic shapes, and be resistant to erosion and lightning. Above all the radome must be transparent i.e. have the minimum insertion losses for that operational frequency range.
In the last 40 years, a range of insulating materials such as ceramics and resin composites have been used to optimise properties such as durability against environment yet possessing maximum and/or tunable radio frequency transparencies. However, in advanced high-mobility applications utilisation of modern lightweight nanocomposites as structural materials for radomes with superior toughness, thermal properties and other functionalities are essential.
OxfordNano’s European Industry project partners in the areas of advanced materials, composite manufacturing and radome design will apply speciality NMs to solve the formidable technical problems in engineering multifunctional composites for radomes, where conventional materials and engineering approaches are reaching the limit of their impact.
There has been much recent progress in understanding NMs formation and scaled-up production techniques from laboratory scale to industrial scale manufacturing. Many technical barriers have been identified in this area of research. At present there is no known commercial technology using h-BN multi-wall nanotubes (BNNTs) at scale. Specially tailored h-BN NMs including h-BN nanotubes from Oxford¹s ERC programmes will underpin the development of ultra-performance mobile radomes.",1
"Title: Relieve-Chol - Reprogramming cell identity to develop new therapies against Cholangiopathies Abstract: Intra- hepatic Cholangiocytes represent one of the main cell type of the liver with hepatocytes. They line the biliary tract and fulfill essential functions such as bile modification and transport. Cholangiocytes are targeted by a diversity of diseases including genetic disorders such as Cystic Fibrosis. There is currently no cure for disorders affecting cholangiocytes and end stage disease require liver transplantation. Importantly, primary cholangiocytes obtained from biopsy can not be grown in vitro without loosing their functional characteristics while transformed cells and animal models rarely recapitulate the entire pathophysiology of human diseases. Consequently, the development of novel drug and therapies remains problematic despite an urgent clinical need. Human induced pluripotent stem cells could provide an advantageous solution to bypass this major challenge. Indeed, these pluripotent stem cells are generated by direct reprograming of somatic cells and they can proliferate almost indefinitely in vitro while maintaining their capacity to differentiate into almost any cell types. Interestingly, hIPSC can be derived from patients with genetic disorders and then differentiated into the relevant cell types for disease modeling purposes. Of direct interest, we recently developed a protocol to generate cholangiocytes from hIPSCs using chemically define conditions. The resulting cells display functional characteristics of their in vivo counterpart including the capacity to transport bile acid. Here, we propose to enable our culture system for the production of  large quantity of hIPSCs derived cholangiocytes in conditions compatible with the pharmaceutical industry requirements. The resulting cells will be then fully characterized to validate their relevance for modeling Cystic fibrosis and for testing small molecules. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to create a novel drug screening platform for the discovery of therapeutics targeting genetic form of cholangiopathies.",0

If humanity is to fully understand the wide range of diseases that are associated to errors in cell division, we must be able to further 'zoom in' on healthy and diseased chromosomes in all their complexity. The CHROMAVISION platform will allow molecular biologists to automatically isolate individual chromosomes from small tissue or cell samples and have these delivered to a super-resolution microscope. Chromosome isolation and delivery is achieved by an opto-fluidic chip that is able to trap, visualise and lyse individual cells and separate metaphase chromosomes from cell lysate. Single chromosomes can be “hand-selected” and brought into focus of the Super-Resolution Correlative Tweezers Fluorescence Microscope (CTFM-SR3D) that is developed in CHROMAVISION. This instrument will for the first time enable 3D, super-resolution, real-time metaphase chromosome observation and manipulation studies under near-physiological conditions. The technique will push the boundaries of what is currently possible in microfluidics and super-resolution microscopy and combine these into a single powerful approach for chromosome studies. Furthermore, the platform will be applied in CHROMAVISION to address key challenges in clinical and fundamental chromosome research, potentially resulting in breakthrough discoveries. Better imaging and understanding of the chromosomal mechanisms will contribute to our knowledge of the etiology of human diseases and aid drug discovery. The platform will also have large clinical value, allowing identification and monitoring of e.g. cancer heterogeneity.",0
"Title: VESAFE - Enhanced 5G Vehicle to Vehicle Technologies for Safe and Reliable Connected Autonomous Vehicles Applications Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) holds great potentials for road safety and efficiency, but two major barriers need to be removed before its potentials can be fully unleashed: significantly enhanced vehicle to vehicle (eV2V) services with millimetre wave (mmWave) communications and reliable cooperative perception with autonomous vehicles (AV) sensors. However, the directional connectivity of mmWave presents new challenges for the whole protocol stack of V2V networks, while reliable cooperative perception requires novel design of deep learning (DL) models for object detection and fusion of sensor data from neighbour AVs. The above challenges underpinned by CAV demand a holistic design and tight integration of connected vehicles (CV) and AV technologies. 
This innovative and multi-disciplinary project VESAFE will train the outstanding Fellow candidate to tackle the key challenges with complementary expertise and realize the full potentials of CAV. A novel cross-layer design is proposed for the research of 5th generation (5G) eV2V schemes with mmWave and reliable cooperative perception for advanced CAV safety applications: the eV2V schemes are AV oriented and greatly assisted by the AV cooperative perception, and the reliable cooperative perception is boosted by the awareness of V2V network conditions. And this project propose a novel integrated evaluation of 5G eV2V and CAV applications to support system design and performance characterization. Through the cutting-edge research, this innovative project will produce robust eV2V schemes and reliable cooperative perception solutions, make breakthrough on 5G V2V and CAV safety applications. It will significantly improve the Fellow’s employability and career prospects, strengthen knowledge transfer, boosting the research and innovation (R&I) capacity and research quality, therefore contributing to Europe’s competitiveness and growth in critical sectors of 5G/6G and AV.",1
"Title: uCARe - You can also reduce emissions Abstract: Since technology and renewal of the vehicle fleet do not lower the level of pollutant emissions or improving air quality fast enough, uCARe develops specific, simple and effective measures targeted at users to further reduce pollutant emissions. These measures are based on the aggregation of scattered high quality data already collected by the consortium, supplemented with results of additional measurement campaigns, and knowledge on the behavior and underlying motivation of users. uCARe sets the following objectives:

-	To identify all user-influenced emission aspects (such as driving behavior and component choice) and the reduction potential of these aspects. The reduction potential is determined with an in uCARe developed emission model
-	A toolset consisting of the emission model as well as measures to reduce emissions. This toolset forms the basis for intervention strategies, in which measures are translated to desired behavior. The tools are made available in such a way that they can easily be used by stakeholders (such as cities and consumer organizations) outside of the project. Through this, anybody can set up local initiatives at limited cost.  
-	The deployment of awareness campaigns and pilot projects via (already committed) stakeholders, tuned towards specific users and their motivation, to show that proposed measures are effective and feasible. 
-	An impact assessment of user-related reduction measures, accompanied with technical evidence and options to improve pollutant emission legislation and policy.

uCARe aims to be complete in the coverage of user-related emissions aspects and types of pollutants. By also implementing, monitoring and evaluating proposed measures, uCARe ensures that these are the most effective. When these effective reduction measures are implemented, pollutant emissions reductions for an individual vehicle as high as 50% are envisaged.",0
"Title: SteamBioAfrica - Innovative Large-Scale Production of Affordable Clean Burning Solid Biofuel and Water in Southern Africa: transforming bush encroachment from a problem into a secure and sustainable energy source Abstract: We will adapt, tailor, and advance the results from the Horizon 2020 project SteamBio (Grant agreement 636865). SteamBio demonstrated innovative continuous Superheated Steam processing of agro-forestry biomass into clean burning solid biofuel. This was recognised by the EU Innovation Radar as a market ready innovation with three SMEs identified as key innovators, bringing these innovations to SteamBioAfrica. Across Southern Africa invasive encroachment by bush and other woody species, aggravated by climate change, is creating environmental, social, and economic damage. We will demonstrate superheated steam processing of invasive woody biomass into clean burning biofuel and water in rural Namibia. Operating at an industrially relevant scale (250kg/hour throughput) for over one year, we will validate this biofuel with domestic and industrial customers in Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. We will prepare sustainable and inclusive business plans to justify post project investment in large scale replication that will result in economic impact, and jobs across the region.
Our objectives will be to validate this superheated steam biomass processing as a viable and sustainable source of large scale, clean burning, secure and affordable energy across Southern Africa. We will confirm market acceptance and ensure that it creates greater value than the cost of harvesting and processing. Quantifying over five different market opportunities, we will create a plan for post project exploitation that will stimulate bush harvesting and reverse encroachment. This will lead to long term socio-economic and environmental benefit across the region. 
SteamBioAfrica will enable large scale, clean, secure, and affordable energy in Africa. It addresses multiple challenges facing Southern Africa, low carbon energy, climate change impacts and resource efficiency. It will transform these challenges into a resilient source of clean and secure energy, water, and sustainable rural economies.",0
"Title: OMICRON - Optical transmission based on integrability and nonlinear Fourier transform Abstract: ""Optical fibre systems form the backbone of global telecommunication networks and carry the bulk of the world's data traffic, serving as a key component of information and communication technology. Although over the years, these systems have become increasingly complex, the quality of optical system performance is still affected by the same key physical features: chromatic dispersion, fiber Kerr nonlinearity, and optical noise. Most of the current optical networks exploit the techniques that were originally developed for linear channels. Thus, it is not surprising that nonlinearity has a detrimental impact on such systems. It has been predicted that, within the next decade the existing optical fibre technology will approach the """"nonlinear transmission limit'', which caps the achievable rate of error-free data transmission.  Thus, in order to reach a the higher capacity of optical fibres it is necessary to shift the relevant information and communications technology paradigm by introducing truly nonlinear modulation, transmission, and signal processing techniques. The aim of this project is to develop ground-breaking visionary concepts and approaches to unlock the capacity of fiber-optic communications beyond the limits of current technology by treating optical fiber as the inherently nonlinear medium it is. Our paradigm-shifting approach is based on the concept mathematical notion of integrability and the related nonlinear Fourier transform-type processing of optical signal, which allow us to use of the fibre nonlinearity in a constructive way. This multidisciplinary project, grouping together the mathematical theory of intergability, advanced signal processing, the physics of nonlinear waves evolution, solitons, and noise interaction with nonlinear excitations, combined with the optical transmission methods and purposes, is aimed at the development of fundamentally new communication technologies to satisfy current and future technology challenges.""",1
"Title: EYE-RISK - Exploring the combined role of genetic and non-genetic factors for developing Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A systems level analysis of disease subgroups, risk factors, and pathways Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the world’s most important age-related blinding disorder. The current proposal utilises epidemiological data describing clinical phenotype, molecular genetics, lifestyle, nutrition, and in-depth retinal imaging derived from existing longitudinal European epidemiological cohorts and biobanks to provide three major insights needed for long-lasting prevention and therapy for AMD: (a) the development of robust algorithms utilising genetic and non-genetic risk factors to identify personalised risks of developing advanced wet and dry AMD; (b) the identification of novel biomarkers for further stratification of disease risks.
New insights from (a)+(b) will be used to elaborate preventive medical recommendations for highrisk subgroups of AMD patients; and (c) the identification of molecular drivers/biological pathways relevant for onset and progression of advanced AMD that will be used to identify and validate new therapeutic targets.

Key deliverables are:
1. Determination of AMD frequency in Europe, and assessment of AMD risk for phenotypical, genetic, environmental, and biochemical risk factors and their interaction. (WP1-3)
2. Development of a web-based prediction model for personalised risk assessment of AMD based on integration of risk profiles derived from retinal imaging, molecular genetics, assessment of lifestyle, and biochemical testing. (WP4)

"Title: PECUNIA - ProgrammE in Costing, resource use measurement and outcome valuation for Use in multi-sectoral National and International health economic evaluAtions Abstract: ProgrammE in Costing, resource use measurement and outcome valuation for Use in multi-sectoral National and International health economic evaluAtions (PECUNIA) addresses the call SC1-PM-20-2017 Methods research for improved health economic evaluation. The consortium brings together 10 partners from 6 countries with complementary methodological expertise. It represents differing health care systems with varying feasibility and acceptability of economic evaluations in evidence-informed decision making. Some countries have established national unit cost programmes (DE, NL, UK), some early stage initiatives (AT, ES, HU). Availability of health utility value sets for outcome evaluations and requirements in terms of the primary analytical perspective of economic evaluations (health & social care vs. societal) also differ. 
Over 36 months, PECUNIA will develop standardised, harmonised and validated multi-sectoral, multi-national and multi-person methods, tools and information for 1) self-reported resource use measurement, 2) reference unit cost valuation, 3) cross-national health utility assessment, and 4) broader wellbeing measurement. To achieve the widest impact possible and exploit its disruptive innovation potential for end users, decision makers, payers and the industry, the work will be executed in close collaboration with 5) external scientific advisors and  broad outreach to all relevant stakeholders. Considering feasibility and relevant societal challenges in the European health systems, selected mental health disease areas (depression, schizophrenia, PTSD) will be used as illustrative examples for cost assessment.
PECUNIA will lead to better understanding of the variations in costs and outcomes within and across countries, improve the quality, comparability and transferability of economic evaluations in Europe, and support the feasibility of broader economic and societal impacts measurement and valuation in multi-sectoral economic evaluations also for HTA.",0
"Title: DEMETRA - Demonstrator of EGNSS Services based on Time Reference Architecture Abstract: DEMETRA aims to demonstrate the feasibility of delivering early EGNSS timing services to end users by utilising an operational demonstrator and conducting tests with pilot applications. Based on the current practice of national metrological laboratories, DEMETRA will define and develop a prototype of a European time disseminator, based on EGNSS., An array of important service features that are necessary for a wide variety of users will be added. These will include: high accuracy calibrated time transfer to a monitored and certified remote time stamping.
Nine different time services are proposed for demonstration by consortium partners.

"Title: Tendon Therapy Train - Engineering in vitro microenvironments for translation of cell-based therapies for tendon repair Abstract: Tendon Therapy Train is a research, training and innovation programme for human and equine tendon repair and regeneration that will exploit recent advancements in tissue engineering by self-assembly (TESA) technologies which have led to the clinical translation and commercialisation of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs).  Although TESA therapies have the potential to revolutionise healthcare for numerous clinical targets, a lack of researchers with the necessary interdisciplinary skillset to advance the field is limiting clinical translation.  Tendon therapy train, a network of 8 beneficiaries and 8 partners (7 universities, 7 companies and 2 hospitals) from six countries across Europe, will train a cohort of 15 researchers to doctoral level in the interdisciplinary area of ATMPs.  The innovative credentials of the research and training programme involve engineering suitable ex vivo culture environments that, by mimicking the native tendon tissue milieu (human and equine), will maintain the tenogenic phenotype  of tendon derived cells and differentiate non-tendon derived cells (stem cells and dermal fibroblasts) towards the tenogenic lineage, subsequently enabling development of three-dimensional cell-assembled tissue equivalents, the clinical potential of which will be assessed in suitable preclinical models.  The comprehensive Tendon Therapy Train programme will equip researchers with transferable inter- and multidisciplinary skills that will further European-based knowledge, innovation, competitiveness and leadership in the field of TESA / ATMP and ultimately enable clinical translation and commercialisation of the developed technologies.",0
"Title: VSHER - Mechanistic Understanding of Heterogenised Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts Through Vibrational Spectroelectrochemistry Abstract: Hydrogen (H2) will play a central role in the future global energy economy. It is therefore of utmost importance to develop economic routes for the production of H2 to make it more attractive as energy carrier medium in the future. Particularly, Co and Ni based compounds have gained attention for molecular H2 catalysis lately. Co glyoxime and pentapyridine coordinative complexes as well as Ni phosphine compounds are promising candidates exhibiting high catalytic activity in both electro- and light driven H2 catalysis in water. Nevertheless, for technological application the catalysts have to be immobilized on electrode surfaces. The adsorption strongly alters the catalytic reactions, which is still not clearly understood. To investigate the adsorbed catalysts, advanced spectroscopic methods are required that are able to provide sensitive information on the catalytic reaction at a molecular level. The aim of this proposed research is to investigate the heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism of Co and Ni mediated catalysis using an innovative combination of potential controlled confocal resonance Raman and ATR FT infrared absorption spectroscopy assisted by electrocatalytic methods and DFT calculations. For this, the three mentioned types of catalysts will be adsorbed on metal oxide surfaces and their catalytic reactions spectroelectrochemically and electrochemically investigated. Special emphasis is led on the role of heterogeneous electron and proton transfer steps on the overall heterogeneous catalytic activity compared to the homogeneous case. Through variation of the electrode material, the modulating material/catalyst interaction is aimed to be investigated in detail. In the outcome, the results will afford a comprehensive picture of the mechanism of metal catalysed HER.",0
"Title: SOLAR2CHEM - Training the next generation of scientists in solar chemicals for a sustainable Europe by hybrid molecule/semiconductor devices Abstract: SOLAR2CHEM will train 15 early stage researchers to fill the existing gap in the European industrial landscape in the area of solar chemicals production and usage in technical, economic and policy aspects. The consortium is formed by 12 beneficiaries including 9 academic and 3 non-academic organisations plus 8 partner organisations to cover a full training programme on scientific, technical and personal development skills which will include secondments in current world leading countries (Japan, US, Australia) to gather the necessary knowledge and implement it in Europe.

Special attention will be given to state of the art characterisation techniques and modelling; and iii) to cover the promotion of solar chemicals within policy-makers and stakeholders, and the development of the private sector through communication to the general public. Strong links with industrial partners and technology transfer offices will ensure that the existing gap is filled.",0
"Title: SEMANTAX - Form-Independent Semantics for Natural Language Understanding Abstract: The project addresses the most important open problem in NLP, to develop a robust semantics that is invariant across different linguistic forms within a language and across languages, and embodies aspects of common-sense knowledge.  It will be derived by machine-learning from machine-reading of vast amounts of text, using an existing state-of-the-art wide-coverage CCG semantic parser developed under previous ERC funding to the PI, initially to build traditional semantic analyses of sentences relating named entities.

Patterns of entailment across semantic expressions relating the same named entities will be then detected across other entities of the same types, to construct directed entailment graphs. Cliques within the graphs constitute paraphrases, and can be collapsed to a single cluster identifier.  The paraphrase-clustered entailment graph can then be used to redefine the semantics delivered by the parser as conjunctions of entailed paraphrase clusters, to make it invariant under paraphrase and common-sense entailment, yet compatible with a traditional logical operator semantics.  The semantics will be extended to a wide range of logical operators, including tense, modality, aspect, and voice, and to implicative and evidential verbs, light verbs, multi-word expressions, and idioms. The method will be applied to semantic parsing, machine translation, knowledge-graph query, and the construction of large knowledge graphs or semantic nets from text, using spreading activation to limit growth in costs of updating and querying the knowledge graph.

In the later stages of the project, the paraphrase-clustered entailment semantics will form the bassi for an incremental semantic parser, using a novel shift-reduce architecture proposed for CCG by the PI in 2000, guided by a modern neural network parsing model acting as a categorial ``supertagger'' and parser action model, for application to language modeling for the machine translation component.",0
"Title: INDIA-H2O - bIo-mimetic and phyto-techNologies DesIgned for low-cost purficAtion and recycling of water Abstract: INDIA-H20 will develop, design and demonstrate high-recovery, low-cost water treatment systems for saline groundwater and industrial wastewaters. The focus for developments will be in the arid state of Gujarat, where surface water resources are very scarce. We will develop novel batch-reverse osmosis technology for a 10-fold reduction in specific energy consumption with high fractions of water recovery (80%) reducing /m3 operating costs to below €0.35/m3 (<30 rupees/m3). Forward osmosis will be developed and piloted for use in wastewater recovery applications including hybrid arrangements with reverse osmosis for further reduction in energy consumption. These solutions will be demonstrated in small-scale rurally relevant low-cost systems for brackish groundwater treatment for use as safe drinking water, which will be extended to include phyto-technology solutions for rural domestic wastewater treatment. Systems will remove salinity and emerging pollutants (e.g. agricultural chemicals), valorise rejected brines in halophytic crop cultivation. For specific industrial wastewater in textile, desalination and dairy we will develop and demonstrate cost-effective high-efficiency hybrid technologies for water recycling with minimum liquid discharge, using advanced membrane technologies to achieve the required water quality for recycling. A centre of excellence will be established in water treatment membrane technologies, design operation and monitoring. Activities such as supply chain mapping and EU India collaboration on developing industrial scale forward osmosis membranes and batch-RO systems will support the development of business models to exploit the developed solutions to mutual EU/India economic advantage. We will analyse and produce policy briefs on economic models and governance arrangements for viable adoption of the developed systems.",0
"Title: DOWN2EARTH - DOWN2EARTH: Translation of climate information into multilevel decision support for social adaptation, policy development, and resilience to water scarcity in the Horn of Africa Drylands Abstract: Prolonged periods of extreme water scarcity induced by drought are detrimental to regional economies through crop and livestock loss, threatening food security in rural communities, and making politically unstable regions more vulnerable to conflict, terrorism, and mass migration. The rural communities of the Horn of Africa Drylands (HAD) are extremely vulnerable to food insecurity and associated economic losses during drought conditions due to low socio-economic levels and low adaptive capacity to climatic shocks, such that frequent and more severe droughts in HAD have dramatically reduced soil moisture and affecting drinking water reserves, leading to increased food insecurity, livestock loss, and major water shortages. DOWN2EARTH is composed of a multidisciplinary project team that will deliver state-of-the-art and community relevant climate services that focus on water scarcity and its consequences at or near the Earth’s surface (hence DOWN2EARTH) to increasingly vulnerable agro-pastoral populations in HAD. The project is designed to bolster existing climate services frameworks, improve decision support to governments and NGOs in the most vulnerable HAD countries (Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia), and to improve community-centric adaptation and resilience to climate change. The project will: assess the socio-economic dimensions and human dynamics of climate change including feedbacks between climatic shocks, human behavior, and policy implementation; characterize historical trends and future projections of water scarcity, food insecurity, population, and land use; develop and enhance multi-level decision-support tools that emphasize the translation of climate information into critical land and water information required for adaptation and resilience by end users and state/regional governments; and strengthen regional climate services through capacity building, citizen science, information dissemination, expansion of data networks, and policy implementation.",0
"Title: MetaVEH - Metamaterial Enabled Vibration Energy Harvesting Abstract: Increasing demand for fully autonomous wireless sensors to service the emerging technologies of the internet of things, remote and real time monitoring of vulnerable environments or self-sensing smart structures is driving a requirement for efficient and novel methods of energy harvesting. The sensor's data communication has a substantial power requirement that presents a serious constraint upon the number of sensors, and their capability. Our primary aim is to realise innovative Lead-free electromechanical energy harvesters; these will be easily installed, to power, in a clean and low-cost manner, autonomous wireless sensing devices thereby eliminating batteries and human intervention: This will revolutionise sensor applications whilst simultaneously reducing chemical waste. This is timely as in current solutions battery replacement is either logistically impossible or too expensive and batteries carry a toxic chemical cost. Solar panels have the environmental drawback of using toxic materials. In our vision of future sensor technology, with our vibration energy harvesters (VEH) as their primary power source, a battery, will become unnecessary, and their associated chemical waste will no longer occur, and these sensors will become truly autonomous. The harvester's mechanical core will draw on advanced multiresonator designs, integrating Lead-free piezoelectric patches enhanced by the unique wave control capacities of resonant elastic metamaterials. Currently microVEH, though promising, suffers due to frequency mismatch: We have the ambition to bridge the gap between different scales by leveraging the potential of metamaterials. This will dramatically increase the energy available for harvesting, and operational bandwidth. For electronic applications the integration of rectifiers in the circuitry will allow for the full exploitation of the multiresonant design.",1
"Title: HIGGSBNDL - Higgs bundles: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Geometry Abstract: String theory provides a unified description of particle physics and gravity, within a consistent theory of quantum gravity. The goal of this research is to develop both the phenomenological implications as well as conceptual foundations of string theory and its non-perturbative completions, M- and F-theory. Both, seemingly independent, questions are deeply connected to a mathematical structure, the Higgs bundle, which characterizes supersymmetric vacua of dimensionally reduced gauge theories, and insights into the moduli space of Higgs bundles will result in a fruitful cross-connection between these subjects.
For string theory to engage in a meaningful dialog with particle physics, it is paramount to gain a universal understanding of the low energy effective theories that can arise from it. Building on the success of studying F-theory vacua in terms of Higgs bundles, we propose to develop the Higgs bundle approach for M-theory on G2-manifolds, leading to a universal characterization of the low energy physics. Methods developed for Higgs bundles of d = 3 N = 2 theories obtained from M5-branes on three-manifolds will be used in this process. Associated to each Higgs bundle is a local G2 manifold and we propose a way (using new results in geometry) to construct compact G2 spaces associated to these, which manifestly ensure the phenomenological soundness of the compactifications.
Higgs bundles have recently also played a key role in studying the compactifications of the M5-brane in M-theory. We propose and develop a new duality between a d = 4 theory on a four-manifold X4 and a d = 2, N = (2,0) supersymmetric gauge theory on a two-sphere S2, obtained by considering the M5-brane theory on X4xS2. The supersymmetric vacua have a characterization in terms of Higgs bundles, which can be studied with tools developed for F- theory Higgs bundles on four-manifolds. Furthermore we propose a concrete approach to derive this duality from first principles.",0
"Title: 5G-VINNI - 5G Verticals INNovation Infrastructure Abstract: 5G-VINNI will accelerate the uptake of 5G in Europe by providing an end-to-end (E2E) facility that validates the performance of new 5G technologies by operating trials of advanced vertical sector services. The 5G-VINNI strategy to achieve this involves: (1) Designing the most advanced 5G facility to demonstrate that technical and business 5G KPIs can be met, (2) Building and operating 7 interworking instances of the E2E facility to prove the capabilities and openness of the system, (3) Creating user friendly zero-touch orchestration, operations and management systems for the 5G-VINNI facilities to ensure operational efficiencies and optimal resource use, (4) Proving the 5G-VINNI capabilities through extensive experiments and measurements of performance against the 5G KPIs, (5) Developing a viable 5G ecosystem model to support the NaaS infrastructure provision as a sustainable business beyond the project, and (6) Promoting the value of 5G-VINNI results to the relevant standards bodies and open source communities. The 5G-VINNI E2E facility will demonstrate the achievement of 5G KPIs across a range of combinations and permutations of new 5G access technologies and end-user equipment types interconnected by the most advanced 5G core network technologies available. For this 5G-VINNI will leverage the latest 5G technologies, including results from previous 5G PPP projects. This approach employs Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing and a rigorous automated testing campaign to validate the 5G KPIs under various combinations of technologies and network loads. To ensure realistic load scenarios 5G-VINNI will create and make available an openness framework to give verticals and peer projects easy access to the 5G-VINNI facilities, both legally and technically, e.g. via open APIs. The 5G-VINNI facilities include 7 infrastructure instances in nationally supported 5G nodes across Europe; this number may be expanded as the ICT-19 projects come on-line in 2019.",1
"Title: TeLSCombe - Temporal Laser cavity-Solitons for micro-resonator based optical frequency combs Abstract: Precise timing has led to many advances, such as GPS and the Internet, which depend critically on frequency and time standards. The currently limited accuracy, however, is hindering the progress towards societal-changing technologies such as telecommunications beyond 5G or precise earth mapping.
Optical atomic clocks based on optical frequency combs – Nobel prize in Physics, 2005 to Hall and Hänsch – are the only technology capable of providing timing accurate up to 10^(-18) seconds, answering such a demand of time precision. The realisation of such clocks in portable scale is expected to change the technology landscape.
Micro-combs – based on miniature optical resonators – have galvanized the attention of the world over the past ten years with the promise to realise the full potential of frequency combs in a compact form. 
However, these devices still do not meet the demand of practical atomic clocks which require reliable optical sources and currently depend on bulky pulsed lasers, which are well-known for their robustness but unfit for portable applications.
Developing energy-efficient micro-combs with the reliability and versatility of control of modern pulsed lasers will require to surpass the intrinsic limitations of the nonlinear physics exploited so far for their generation.
Here we propose a high-gain/ high-risk research plan which steers from the state-of-the-art and builds on a different physics for developing micro-combs with control capabilities beyond the current miniature solutions.
Specifically, we will exploit the generation of localised waves called temporal laser cavity-solitons in complex resonators exhibiting lasing and parametric nonlinear interactions. Such a setting is mostly unexplored and this proposal will demonstrate the unique features of these waves and their general impact in broader physics. Eventually, this study will pave the way to a class of robust micro-combs which can be controlled with user-friendly machine learning approaches.",1
"Title: 5GCAR - Fifth Generation Communication Automotive Research and innovation Abstract: There are two ongoing industrial trends, one in the mobile communications industry and one in the automotive industry, which are becoming interwoven and will jointly provide new capabilities and functionality for upcoming intelligent transport systems and future driving.

The automotive industry is on a path where vehicles are continuously becoming more aware of their environment, due to a permanent increase in various types of integrated sensors; at the same time the amount of automation in vehicles increases, which – with some intermediate steps – will eventually culminate in fully-automated driving without human intervention. Along this path, the amount of interactions increases, both in-between vehicles, as well as between vehicles and an increasingly intelligent road infrastructure. As a consequence, the significance and reliance on capable communication systems for vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication is becoming a key asset that combined with sensor-based technologies will enhance the performance of automated driving and increase further traffic safety.

On the other hand, the mobile communications industry has over the last 25 years connected more than 5 billion people and mobile phones have become part of our daily living. The next step in wireless connectivity is to connect all kinds of devices that can benefit from being connected, with a total of 28 billion connected devices predicted until 2021. It will support the transformation of industries on their journey of digitization. In this step, mobile communications has the ambition to explicitly target the communication needs of vertical industry with corresponding requirements being set for the standardization of 5G until 2020.

5GCAR brings together a strong consortium from the automotive industry and the mobile communications industry, to develop innovation at the intersection of those industrial sectors in order to support a fast, and successful path towards safer and more efficient future driving.",1
"Title: MicroProtLip - New microfluidic tools for characterization of protein-lipid interactions Abstract: Cellular function and malfunction depends crucially on the interactions of proteins and other cellular components, specifically with lipid membranes. Such interactions are a key to the compartmentalization of a wide range of cellular mechanisms into discrete organelles, allowing to maintain homeostasis. In spite of implications to life sciences and drug discovery our current understanding of protein–lipid interactions is limited. This is primarily due to the challenges imposed by existing methods for determining the fundamental interactions of a wide range of proteins and lipid bilayers due to the high level of heterogeneity of the formed complexes. Recent advances in the development of microfluidic techniques for characterisation of biomolecular complexes together with sensitive optical detection methods open new possibilities for fundamental studies of protein–lipid interactions. The main objective of the proposed project is the development of a transformative microfluidic platforms dedicated for the study of interactions of lipid membranes with protein molecules. Experienced Researcher aims at the implementation of microfluidic technologies: micro free flow electrophoresis and nano deterministic lateral displacement, for the parallel development of two types of platforms. The development of the platform will be highlighted by addressing exemplary fundamental questions in molecular biology of interest that concern a wide range of aspects of mechanism of protein–lipid interaction. The realization of the objectives will be based on close collaboration between academic and non-academic sectors, in pursue to bridge the gap between fundamental and applied research. This action will set up a tight collaboration between the University of Cambridge (UCAM) and Fluidic Analytics Limited (FAL) who have pioneered the use of commercial microfluidic platforms for efficient characterization of biomolecular interactions.",0
"Title: HiSea - High Resolution Copernicus-Based Information Services at Sea for Ports and Aquaculture Abstract: The Sentinel missions and Copernicus Services provide a global view of environmental parameters of prime importance for climate and environmental research.

The immediate market uptake of the HiSea services by the targeted ports and aquaculture users is guaranteed. Linking to the market and experience of the partners to deliver similar services, HiSea has the capability to demonstrate the proposed services at regional or even global scale.",1
"Title: Pearls Constellation - A next generation telecommunication platform based on a nano-satellites constellation Abstract: Despite broad expansion of mobile networks, coverage gaps remain due to a lack of ICT infrastructure: 0.72bn people globally still lack access to basic voice and text services, with around 3.9bn (53% of the world’s population) lacking access to the internet at 3G speeds. The majority of these uncovered populations are low income and live in rural regions of Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Current solutions for communication service in rural areas are based on large communication satellites (3,000 kg), leading to lengthy and costly development, as well as high costs of production, launch and operation. The central challenge in reaching uncovered communities is overcoming the unfavorable cost- benefit equation related to installing an operative communication infrastructure (with launch, maintenance and operating costs), whilst providing reliable and affordable communication. 
With a sophisticated and revolutionary telecommunication network infrastructure leveraging nanosatellite technology, the Pearls constellation of 200 nano-satellites will provide affordable and reliable communication services anywhere within the Equatorial band. An advanced space technology, combined with a complex software infrastructure, provides a robust satellite communication platform that can be accessed at a low price and from any commercial cell phone. SAS’s goal is to provide affordable communication services and coverage to billions of people living along the equator who currently have no access to simple communication service. 
During the feasibility assessment, a detailed scale-up plan to the constellation of 200 nano-satellites will be set up, and a supply chain will be established, as well as plan for the launch of 200 nano-satellites will be drafted.  During the second phase of project, SAS will upgrade the software, scale-up the control and management platform, and will launch 5 nano-satellites in Space.",1
"Title: RECENT - Ultra-Dense Unsupervised Heterogeneous Wireless Cloud Coded Networks for 5G/B5G Abstract: ""Beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks will undoubtedly have greatly increased density and scale compared to current networks, resulting in massive interaction between nodes. It will be infeasible to provide fixed connections to all access nodes, and hence these networks will evolve towards a heterogeneous, multihop, self-organizing architecture. Moreover, for several significant B5G scenarios (such as vehicular networks in """"smart cities"""") the topology may be a priori unknown and rapidly time-variant: therefore, it will be impractical to provide a global coordinating authority, and hence these networks will be essentially unsupervised. (Security remains paramount, and physical security mechanisms especially appropriate.) The conventional networking paradigm will be severely limited by interference in these scenarios, greatly reducing efficiency. It has already been shown in both theory and practice that wireless physical-layer network coding (WPNC) is nevertheless capable of resolving this situation because it can allow relay nodes to extract useful information from all combined received signals, rather than treating them as deleterious interference. 
However, previous work on WPNC [1-5] has not addressed the case of large-scale, unsupervised, secure, dynamic networks. RECENT will address such networks starting with fundamental theory and technology, including information theory, network coded modulation (NCM) for WPNC, stochastic network theory, and physical layer security. The developed technologies will be deployed and validated in the system level simulator and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. Running in parallel to the technical activities, a rigorously crafted innovation management programme will assess business opportunities of RECENT technologies, taking into consideration standards and regulation, and hence ensure that they achieve their full industrial and societal impact.""",1
"Title: ASTROSTAT - Development of Novel Statistical Tools for the Analysis of Astronomical Data Abstract: We propose an interdisciplinary collaboration network involving leading groups in Astrophysics (Astrophysics Group in Crete, Geneva Observatory, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Ohio State University. and Nortwestern University),  and Statistics (Imperial College, University. of California Davis). The goal of this project is to share expertise between the different fields and geographical areas in order to tackle key questions in observational Astrophysics, related to the nature of dark energy and dark matter, the populations of accreting binary stars in galaxies and their evolution, and the morphological and activity classification of galaxies. To address each of these questions we will use state-of-the-art observations and theoretical models, and we will develop novel, principled tools for statistical analysis in the domains of source classification, structure detection, and fitting. The methods developed under this program will have lasting value and applications beyond the field of Astrophysics.",0
"Title: IDEAS - Novel building Integration Designs for increased Efficiencies in Advanced Climatically Tunable Renewable Energy Systems Abstract: Buildings play a significant role in the global energy balance. Typically, they account for 20-30% of the total primary energy requirement of industrialized countries, 40% in EU. Applying the proposed integrated RES to buildings is an important application for wider integration and deployment of renewable energy and to achieving our binding EU targets of at least a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030, compared to 1990 and at least 27% of renewable energy in EU.   The IDEAS project will create an innovative building integrated renewable energy system (RES) which will cost effectively exceed current RES efficiencies, generating electricity, heat and cooling and optimised for multifamily, public and commercial buildings in different climatic conditions.  The research aim is to create a novel low-cost building integrated RES maximizing the output tuneable for different climatic conditions through novel luminescent and geometric concentrator techniques leading to current solar system efficiencies being exceeded electrically.  Thermally enhancement will be achieved using enhanced organic phase change materials (PCM) with a passive biomimetic heat transfer mechanism for heat storage and discharge. An electrically driven multi-source heat pumpHP system will then use the main energy sources at building scale (waste heat from the system, air and ground), to provide the input to an integrated underfloor heating and hot water system, and to manage the thermal energy storage.  This building integrated RES will use advanced control techniques to maximize performance and electrical and thermal/cooling self-sufficiency in the building. The technology will be optimized and demonstrated for use in multi-family residential buildings, commercial and public buildings.",0
"Title: NovoFold - De novo protein discovery as a tool for understanding the folding conundrum Abstract: Order is a prerequisite for activity, which is the essence of the sequence-structure-function paradigm of bio-macromolecules. Proteins are a case in point, displaying intricate architectures and impressive functions. Understanding how the primary sequence of these complex macromolecules relates to their 3D structure and vice versa is of fundamental interest and the basis for broad technological exploitation of proteins. 
The proposed research aims to investigate the folding space of proteins, gaining new insights that will help in solving the folding conundrum. Specifically, the frequency and sequence patterns of ordered polypeptides and their physical and structural properties will be experimentally analysed. Based on these data sets, exploratory data analysis can be performed, providing unprecedented insights into protein folding. Generation of quantifiable high quality data is thus of utmost importance for this project. One of the main objectives of this proposal is therefore the development of an ultrahigh-throughput experimental platform for discovery of de novo proteins with unparalleled precision, using state-of-the-art molecular biology methods. Based on cutting-edge mRNA display technology, I will isolate folded polypeptides from naïve libraries with up to 1E13 members in the size range of 50-100 amino acids. Modern bioinformatic analysis, modelling and biophysical characterisation will be performed to analyse the folding space of proteins and derive new empirical folding rules. 
Given the increasing importance of protein engineering in fundamental research and industry, the results of this study will be of interest to a wide range of scientists. The fellowship will provide training in state-of-the-art techniques such as statistical data analysis and structural biology. The results of this research project will form the basis for future efforts to exploit the biotechnological potential of newly discovered proteins.",0
"Title: FORCE-UI - Force-responsive Deformable User Interfaces Abstract: Touch input is the universal approach for communicating intention to interactive computing systems. However, touchscreens are flat, solid surfaces that fail to reproduce the qualities of real-world object interaction (e.g. deformation, stiffness, springiness). Further, their expressivity is fundamentally bounded by a single measurable dimension: contact with a solid, touch-sensitive surface. This project will radically increase the expressivity of touchscreen-based interaction by co-locating three force modalities into a single visual display surface (force input, resistive- and kinetic- force feedback). This will create a new paradigm for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Force Responsive Deformable User Interfaces (FRUI). FRUIs will allow users to ‘push through’ a display and for the display to ‘push back’.

To achieve this ambitious goal, I will combine innovative hardware prototyping with experimental computer science and psychophysical study methodologies to complete four key research objectives: (1) Develop novel engineering approaches to construct FRUI; (2) Empirically characterise humans’ capabilities and responses during interaction with FRUI; (3) Construct conceptual models, metaphors, and principles for user interaction with FRUI; (4) Evaluate the expressivity, efficiency, and user satisfaction of FRUIs.

I am considered an international leader in the development of shape-changing interfaces (interfaces whose physical geometry adapts to underlying digital content), as evidenced through my strong research track record (including two recent agenda-setting papers at the premier HCI conference), international community leadership, and external grant success. This background ideally places me to conduct all aspects of this highly ambitious programme of work. FORCE-UI has the potential to revolutionise touch input, and in doing so will have a significant impact on society’s use of interactive systems.",0
"Title: ELVER - Engineering with Logic and Verification: Mathematically Rigorous Engineering for Safe and Secure Computer Systems Abstract: Computer systems have become critical to modern society, but they are pervasively subject to security flaws and malicious attacks, with large-scale exposures of confidential data, denial-of-service and ransom attacks, and the threat of nation-state attackers: they are trusted, but are far from trustworthy. This is especially important for the major pan-industry components of our information infrastructure: processors, programming languages, operating systems, etc.

The basic problem is that conventional engineering techniques suffice only to make systems that *usually* work. The usual test-and-debug development methods, with poorly specified abstractions described in prose, lack the mathematical rigour of other engineering disciplines - yet the huge investment in legacy systems and skills makes it hard to improve.

ELVER will develop *mathematically rigorous* methods for specifying, testing, and reasoning about *real systems*, focussed on the core mechanisms used by hardware and software to enforce security boundaries.  It will establish mathematical models for the industry ARM architecture, used pervasively in mobile phones and embedded devices, and the CHERI research architecture, which protects against many attacks. Using these, ELVER will build tools for analysis of system software, develop techniques for mathematical proof of safety and security properties, and explore improved systems programming languages.  ELVER will build on successful collaborations with ARM, IBM, and the C/C++ ISO standards committees.  It will directly impact mainstream processor architectures, languages, and development methods, smoothly complementing existing methods while simultaneously enabling longer-term research towards the gold standard of provably secure systems.

ELVER will thus demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a more rigorous approach to system engineering, putting future systems on more solid foundations, and hence making them safer and more secure",1
"Title: NEMF21 - Noisy Electromagnetic Fields - A Technological Platform for Chip-to-Chip Communication in the 21st Century Abstract: Wireless Chip-to-Chip (C2C) communication and wireless links between printed circuit boards operating as Multiple Input Multiple Output devices need to become dominant features of future generations of integrated circuits and chip architectures. They will be able to overcome the information bottleneck due to wired connections and will lead the semiconductor industry into a new More-Than-Moore era. Designing the architecture of these wireless C2C networks is, however, impossible today based on standard engineering design tools. Efficient modelling strategies for describing noisy electromagnetic fields in complex environments are necessary for developing these new chip architectures and wireless interconnectors. Device modelling and chip optimization procedures need to be based on the underlying physics for determining the electromagnetic fields, the noise models and complex interference pattern. In addition, they need to take into account input signals of modern communication systems being modulated, coded, noisy and eventually disturbed by other signals and thus extremely complex. 
Recent advances both in electrical engineering and mathematical physics make it possible to deliver the breakthroughs necessary to enable this future emerging wireless C2C technology by creating a revolutionary electromagnetic field simulation toolbox. Increasingly sophisticated physical models of wireless interconnects and associated signal processing strategies and new insight into wave modelling in complex environments based on dynamical systems theory and random matrix theory make it possible to envisage wireless communication on a chip level. This opens up completely new pathways for chip design, for carrier frequency ranges as well as for energy efficiency and miniaturisation, which will shape the electronic consumer market in the 21st century.",1
"Title: STANDUP - Smartphone Thermal ANalysis for Diabetic foot Ulcer Prevention and treatment Abstract: Diabetic foot (DF) disease includes neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease and infection which may lead to ulceration and subsequent lower limb amputation. DF ulcers could be further reduced according to diabetes experts. Temperature is one of the possible clinical parameter which is not currently well exploited. Recently, smartphones can acquire thermal images thanks to dedicated thermal camera. The STANDUP project proposes a smartphone based system such that mobile, accurate, friendly, low cost and fast thermal analysis of the plantar foot surface can be achieved. The smartphone thermal imaging system will be composed of a smartphone and of a FlirOne thermal camera. In the STANDUP project, two smartphone applications will be developed. The first one (A1: hyperthermia detection and analysis of thermal variations in time) will permit to detect possible hyperthermia of the plantar foot surface and will analyze temperature variations on targeted regions of interest. The second smartphone application will assess temperature, color, and 3D shape of DF ulcer along time. These smartphone applications will be evaluated during clinical trials in hospitals. In the first clinical trial, a cold stress test will permit to detect neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease. In the second clinical trial, temperature, color, and 3D shape in DF ulcers will be studied during its treatment. The third clinical study will assess the effectiveness of new insoles, these new insole will be developed during STANDUP with the objective to relive hyperthermia in DF. These 2 smartphone applications will be enhanced to result in an advanced prototype of smartphone based system for the targeted medical applications. This advanced smartphone thermal prototype, and the new insoles, will be developed during STANDUP to rapidly address novel market demands in DF early diagnosis, and in DF ulcer prevention and treatment and will lead to economic  benefits for  social  and  healthcare  system.",1
"Title: FUTEBOL - FUTEBOL: Federated Union of Telecommunications Research Facilities for an EU-Brasil Open Laboratory Abstract: FUTEBOL composes a federation of research infrastructure in Europe and Brazil, develops a supporting control framework, and conducts experimentation-based research in order to advance the state of telecommunications through the investigation of converged optical/wireless networks. Current wireless trends (cell densification, coordinated communication, massive MIMO) pose a new set of challenges that require the joint consideration of optical and wireless network architectures. These problems are of direct impact to emerging economies such as Brazil, with highly heterogeneous infrastructure capabilities and demand, as well as to more established markets such as the EU, which aims to regain its leadership in the next generation of telecommunication technologies. FUTEBOL establishes the research infrastructure to address these research challenges through innovation over this infrastructure, with a consortium of leading industrial and academic telecommunications institutions. In this capacity, the methodology of the FUTEBOL project is organized into three steps: i) the composition of federated research infrastructure suited for integrated optical/wireless experimentation, ii) the development of a converged control framework to support experimentation on the federated research infrastructure, and iii) the direct advancement of telecommunications through research using the developed research infrastructure and control framework. The steps of FUTEBOL relate to one another in a layered manner: the end-user driven advancement of telecommunications relies on the development of the FUTEBOL converged control framework, which, in turn, requires the composition of federated research infrastructure. In this way, FUTEBOL directly addresses the agreed priority areas of Brazil and Europe cooperation to guide future innovation in the area of ICT. By leveraging and extending the prior work of the FIRE programme and FIBRE project, FUTEBOL expedites industry-centric innovation.",1
"Title: iGame - Multi-dimensional Intervention Support Architecture for Gamified eHealth and mHealth Products Abstract: This project investigates evidence based gamification techniques for eHealth and mHealth and develops a multi-dimensional intervention support architecture/platform in order to improve the efficacy of gamified eHealth products (web-based health tools and health apps). The project will develop advanced game production techniques with ready-to-use toolkits to accelerate the innovation process for eHealth and mHealth products. This will help digital industry (games, IoT and ICT) to innovate new products and services with science and technology underpinnings.
It addresses fundamental issues of gamification for eHealth interventions including its development process and evaluation methods for measuring its efficacy. The outcomes of the project, manifested as gamification Toolkits, an integrated ICT Platform, and clinical assessment Methodologies as whole as a framework, will greatly accelerate the pace and scale of eHealth innovation by transforming and increasing its quality and efficiency through advanced technology tools, frameworks and methodologies. By using gamified physical activity engagement as a clinical intervention case study, the proposed framework will be evaluated and tested within patients in primary care settings, who are identified as physical inactive and at risk for their conditions due to sedentary behaviours. However, the gamification framework remains flexible and portable to other contexts of digital health interventions.

The project presents two key innovation components:
•	An innovative collaborative R&D programme in collaboration with industry, focus on delivering solutions to address challenges in the development process of gamified eHealth products i.e. productivity and efficacy.
•	A strong and sustainable model of collaboration with digital industry and other relevant stakeholders fully integrated to develop the innovation capacity in SMEs in eHealth products, specifically gamified eHealth products and services.",0
"Title: SoftFIRE - Software Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization Testbed within FIRE+ Abstract: SoftFIRE+ partners are aiming at Research and Innovation actions pursuing the integration of existing experimental facilities, testbeds and laboratories into FIRE+. The project focuses on new technologies like SDN and NFV in order to create a reliable, secure, interoperable and programmable experimental network infrastructure within the FIRE+ initiative. The Consortium will federate existing experimental testbeds in order to create an infrastructure that Third Parties can use to develop new services and applications. The federation is a step towards the creation of a new network experimental infrastructure that could be used as an initial 5G oriented platform.
The SoftFIRE+ testbed will offer the possibility to assess and improve programmable solutions. In this environment there are three key elements to consider: programmability, interoperability and security. These properties have to be assessed in terms of efficiency, functional responsiveness and in general terms E2E QoS. 
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate and assess the level of maturity of adopted solutions and to show how they can support the full potential of these properties in a real world infrastructure by creating, nurturing and supporting an ecosystem of Third parties able to make use of the SoftFIRE+ testbed and to functionally extend it.
The project aims at creating a broad ecosystem of companies engaged with the evolution of the SoftFIRE+ testbed. In order to achieve this goal, the project will spend a considerable part of its effort and budget for involving Third parties in the usage and consolidation of the platform. The mechanisms envisaged for this are: Open Calls and specific events (like Hackathon, Plug-tests and Challenges). The federated infrastructure will be used in order to a) develop new services and applications from Third parties, and b) develop new platform functionalities.",1
"Title: PJ18 4DTM - 4D Trajectory Management Abstract: One of the main obstacles of reaching Single European Sky’s objectives is management of flight trajectories. Inaccuracies are difficult to spot and information given to stakeholders about the trajectory is limited, arriving late, and full of inconsistencies and wrong assumptions. Military Flights are currently not integrated in the ATM-system, so demanding special treatment.

Additionally, there is a lack of complete, updated, unique and coherent aeronautical and meteorological information at European level, which again limits the accuracy of the predicted trajectory and so difficult detecting incoming issues and designing optimum solutions.

This project addresses solutions for the above limitations. Harmonized and global trajectory information sharing, including improved negotiation mechanisms, will enable significant operational benefits on flight management. The aim is to enable a unique and integrated view of all flights trajectories (including military ones) among the stakeholders. This is improved thanks to new tools and capabilities ensuring all stakeholders are managing a single, updated and complete view of the forecasted meteorology and airspace configuration.

Both solutions above will increase safety and efficiency - a very important step towards ensuring that anyone can fly safer, cheaper and quicker in Europe in 10 years.

As so many stakeholders are involved, this issue cannot be solved at national level. All stakeholders (mainly air navigation service providers, as well as air and ground industry partners) need to be involved as all will need to perform changes to ensure successful implementation. The SESAR 2020 Programme is the only place where this can happen.

In this project we have ensured participation of the major ATM stakeholders which ensures having the knowledge and expertise to come up with the concepts, prototypes and platforms to provide sustainable results usable throughout Europe.",1
"Title: EStoPARENTING - Individual Differences in Environmental Sensitivity to Parenting Abstract: Parenting is one of the strongest, most robust and consistent predictors of child development. Although parenting is important for all children, a substantial number of studies provide evidence that some children are more negatively affected by harsh parenting than other children. More recently, it has been shown that some of these “vulnerable” children also benefit more from supportive parenting: they are generally more sensitive to their rearing environment. However, these studies tend to rely on proxy markers of such Environmental Sensitivity (ES). Specifically designed measures of ES do currently not exist. We propose to develop a new observer-rated ES measure in early childhood and, applying this measure, investigate whether more sensitive children are more affected by both negative and positive parenting practices in middle childhood. Furthermore, we will explore associations between this new objective measure of ES and related temperament traits as well as gene variants, applying a multidisciplinary approach. The project is based on existing data from the on-going longitudinal Stony Brook Temperament Study. The Experienced Researcher, with extensive proficiency in parenting research and in the coding of child behaviour, will be trained to undertake this research with the support of the leading experts in the field. This project will significantly advance the field of developmental psychology by providing the first objective measure of sensitivity in early childhood which will allow for more precise empirical testing of Environmental Sensitivity. The findings of the proposed study will significantly deepen our understanding and insight into the interplay between individual difference in Environmental Sensitivity and parenting quality across childhood by applying a modern multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of developmental psychology with molecular genetics.",0
"Title: Mag-ID - Magnetic identification Abstract: The project consortium consisting of BOGEN (project coordinator, SME), INESC-MN (research), and INSPECTRON (SME) will bring the novel identification solution for track & trace, anti-counterfeiting and product verification to market. INSPECTRON has recently developed a magnetic ink barcode reader and has implemented this in a mailer project. BOGEN has developed with INESC-MN a new technology to read magnetic ink with TMR sensing technology. Combining these approaches results in a disruption for the identification and authentication/anti-counterfeiting markets with Mag-ID, the magnetic readable barcode based on ink. The objective of this action is to introduce Mag-ID as a cost-efficient alternative for high volume tracking & tracing, brand protection and inspection and to replace passive RFID as a cheap solution for high volume applications. Since magnetic barcodes are dirt resistant, the technology will replace some barcodes with a more reliable read. The technology allows for distance reading, which means that the information can be read through coatings, e.g. parts before and after a paint booth can be identified automatically with the same technology. This can be used for tracking and tracing of components in a subassembly e.g. in identification documents to ensure that personal data and pictures are matched in the process and after assembly. Together with a verification as a service platform, SMEs can provide authentication and validation services world-wide. Magnetic barcodes can replace many RFID solutions as they are environment-friendly without separate electronic device disposal. Within Mag-ID, the SME partners will demonstrate the results manifold: BOGEN Mag-ID one-shot reader in a volume application, INSPECTRON with evaluation modules for the Mag-ID brand protection, tracking and inspection solutions. INSPECTRON will move into a service-based business model, while BOGEN will create a separate business for a project-based model.",1
"Title: GEMM - Growth, Equal Opportunities, Migration and Markets Abstract: The Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission provides an important opportunity for advancement of our knowledge of growth and innovation in the European Union labour markets as well as the dynamism that creates inclusive but competitive social environments. The GEMM project relates in particular to the Migration, Prosperity and Growth Dimension of the Call on the European Growth Agenda. With over 30 researchers located in several EU member states and Norway, our consortium will approach the topic and deliver: 
-	An analysis of the obstacles to the successful incorporation of migrants and in particular to the attraction and retention of highly-skilled migrants;
-	A thorough assessment of the migration-related drivers of growth and the optimal functioning of markets; 
-	An assessment of ethnic inequality in the labour market as a barrier to competitiveness and innovation in EU member states.
-	A set of policy recommendations that contain concrete guidelines as to how migrants can contribute to the EU economy and society

These deliverables are realised by putting forward a scientifically innovative research agenda that combines a variety of methods and crosscutting expertise. Our consortium contains economists, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists who have made outstanding contributions to the field of migration and inequality research. Furthermore, our empirical approach is multi-method; we make use of survey, experimental and qualitative research methods to advance knowledge.",0
"Title: 5G-INDUCE - Open cooperative 5G experimentation platforms for the industrial sector NetApps Abstract: The success of 5G technologies depends closely on their ability to attract vertical stakeholders, seeking the move of their services from cloud to the edge to meet unique KPIs. 5G-INDUCE project is based on the belief that such attractiveness requires vertical stakeholders and NetApp developers to be able to smoothly deploy and manage applications in distributed 5G network environments, in a secure fashion and with strict KPI requirements.
5G-INDUCE relies on the deployment of an open ETSI NFV compatible 5G orchestration platform for the deployment of advanced 5G NetApps. The platform’s unique features provide the capability to the NetApp developers to define and modify the application requirements while the underlay intelligent OSS can expose the network capabilities to the end users on the application level without revealing any infrastructure related information. This process enables an application-oriented network management and optimization approach that is in line with the operator’s role as manager of its own facilities, while it offers the operational environment to any developers and service providers through which tailored made applications can be designed and deployed, for the benefit of vertical industries and without any indirect dependency through a cloud provider.
The project focuses on the Industry 4.0 vertical sector, as one of the fastest growing and most impactful sectors in European economy with high potentials for service development SMEs and with the capability to tackle all diverse cases of service requirements. The platform is integrated over 3 5G Experimentation Facilities in Spain, Greece, and Italy, and extended with links towards specific Industries, for the showcasing of NetApps in real 5G environment. The consortium includes all the required stakeholders (MNOs, Industries, System integrators and SMEs) from the benefited business sectors evaluated in the project, while significant part of the work (>50%) is conducted by innovative SMEs.",1
