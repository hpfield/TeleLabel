"Title: ACCEPT - Assistant for Quality Check during Construction Execution Processes for Energy-efficienT buildings Abstract: Assistant for Quality Check during Construction Execution Processes for Energy-efficienT buildings

Problem: What the consortium sees as a major problem today is the potential loss of benefits of energy-efficient building components because of the lack of knowledge or bad implementation during the construction processes.


Solution: During the project ACCEPT will be created – An assistant for quality check during construction execution processes for energy-efficienT buildings. The assistant will run on Smart Glasses and unobtrusively guide workers during the construction on site. This provides a standardized and coordinated process for all workers, ensuring that all benefits of energy-efficient building components are maintained.

From a user perspective ACCEPT is focused on the following very clear main results:

1. The Construction Operator Assistant App (CoOpApp) running on Smart Glasses, which passively collects data and actively provides guidance to the worker on site during the building process. (Pillar I: Advanced Knowledge Transfer for Energy-efficient Construction)
2. A Site Manager App (SiMaApp)   running on a mobile device, which allows to remotely coordinate the working process as well as collect additional data on site by different sensors. (Pillar II: Agile Project Coordination for Bridging Heterogeneity)

3. An interactive web-based Dashboard as a monitoring and quality assurance solution. The Dashboard will use self-inspection methods to determine important characteristics such as U-Values. (Pillar III: Adaptive Quality Assurance with Self-Inspection Features)

The project is fully build around achieving a maximum of impaxt: The three results will be accompanied by 7 real-world pilots grouped into 3 piloting areas within the project. Pilots are located in 4 different EU countries.",True
"Title: ONE5G - E2E-aware Optimizations and advancements for the Network Edge of 5G New Radio Abstract: ONE5G commits to provide technical investigations and recommendations to evolve ‘5G’ towards ‘5G advanced’ as requested by the work program. Release 15 from 3GPP is about to set up a valuable initial specification for paving the way to reach the ultimate goals for 5G. However, we see major aspects not yet reasonably covered, requiring more research activities to happen: - Means ensuring 5G to be consistently rolled-out not only in agglomerations, but also in less densely populated areas, to  avoid the digital divide to occur as in earlier generations.
- Means ensuring 5G to support all foreseen services efficiently and concurrently in a generic way, to avoid the emergence of a set of specialised solutions lacking synergy effects such as economy of scale and multiplexing gains.
- Means ensuring 5G to efficiently handle all degrees of heterogeneity stemming from the multiplicity of services and environments, network nodes and devices, spectrum bands and access types (licensed, unlicensed and lightly licensed).

In ONE5G, 14 experienced European players of wireless research are gathering to jointly drive forward the vision of 5G by 
- delivering advanced link enhancements beyond Release 15, including efficient multi-service access schemes, advanced massive MIMO enablers and link management mechanisms
- researching and proposing highly generic performance optimization schemes for 5G, to achieve successful deployment and operation, including optimizations for both the network operator and the E2E user-experienced performance
- identifying the cost driving elements for the roll-out and operation and to propose adaptations to allow sustainable provision of wireless services everywhere
- validating the developed extensions and modifications through different approaches: analytically, by means of extensive simulations and with selected proof-of-concepts
- producing a high number of valuable publications, IPR and standardization contributions",True
"Title: KDRP - KiWi Power Limited’s Revolutionary, Low Cost, Demand Response Platform (KDRP) Abstract: CHALLENGE: Demand response (DR) is central to the successful evolution of a new low carbon electricity system in order to deliver grid flexibility & stability, however it is progressing slowly in the EU due to technological barriers which prevent widespread uptake: high in cost hardware (€4.000 - €6.000); not specifically designed for DR → lack critical functionality (e.g. wireless communication, integration of renewables); & not sufficiently open for wider industry participation.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:  To address the need for innovations that overcome principal barriers to DR, this project seeks to advance KPLs Energy Management Platform, KEMP, from a prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment (TRL6) to complete & qualified commercial prototype (TRL8).  KEMP is a low cost, automated ancillary services platform which consists of: [1] Unique hardware: multi-asset control; first platform to integrate renewable assets; wireless communication between assets → reduced installation cost; & sec. by sec. meter readings – requirement for Frequency Response programmes.  [2] Innovative software: cloud based – for greater scalability; flexibility & remote monitoring,  forecasting model - for integration of renewables; & optimisation engine - to  max. revenues.

END USERS: [1] Initial target = large scale commercial & industrial (C&I) orgs with high MW capacity (>1MW) e.g. financial, telecoms, hospitals, hotels etc. Asset types: DRUPS systems & HVAC. [2] Secondary target = SMEs with low MW capacity (50kW< capacity < 1MW) incl. Water Pump Stations, Small Data Centres, Retail Stores. Asset types: Variable Speed Motors, HVAC, UPS systems etc.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: tech validation, market analysis, economic & business assessment, operational  capacity analysis. Activities will be delivered within a 4 month period, & result in a comprehensive feasibility report detailing the next steps towards development & commercialisation, forming the basis of the SMEI Phase II Business Plan.",True
"Title: CORAL - COntrolling network RAndom Lasers on chip Abstract: The photonics industry in Europe is in rapid growth, lasers in particular have played a central role in several technological developments for many decades, from communications to medicine. As photonic devices shrink in both physical size and power consumption, integrated photonic devices will increasingly penetrate into consumer products such as smartphones and photonic sensors, for various applications from motion detection to navigation of autonomous vehicles. 
The European Industrial doctorate program CORAL will address the increasing need for educated professionals in this field, by the training of two young researchers in photonics technology and in particular in the relatively new field of random lasers, which is at the cross-roads between nanophotonics and neuromorphic applications.
CORAL proposes a training programme between two world-class institutions, IBM and Imperial College London (ICL) each bringing in unique expertise and providing an appropriate balance of applied industrial research as well as in-depth understanding of the underlying physics. 
CORAL will bridge the entire value chain in III-V photonics integration based on both bonding and direct monolithic growth to establishing a simulation framework for networks of nanolasers. Both ESRs will gain experience with hands-on laser fabrication in the IBM cleanroom facilities, combined with various  optical characterization routines at both IBM and ICL, and they will gain a deep understanding of laser physics from the advanced simulation at ICL. In addition to providing them with a scientific training meeting the needs of the European photonics industry, this will also push the emerging field of random laser networks towards a new level of maturity based on a III-V on silicon platform. Thereby, opening up for  potential integration with silicon CMOS, and an entirely new range of applications.",True
"Title: CHROMPART - Partition calculus on graphs, digraphs and hypergraphs with uncountable chromatic number Abstract: Our main goal is to develop the theory of partition calculus on graphs, digraphs and hypergraphs with emphasis on interactions between one-and multi-dimensional relations. Such global characteristics crucially depend on local, often finitary structural properties. This places our project at the meeting point of finite and infinite combinatorics with logic and set theory.  Some of the most important questions that motivate our investigations were first raised by P. Erdős and A. Hajnal in the 1960s. Their problems still guide research across finite and infinite combinatorics including the most recent works of R. Diestel, N. Hindman, P. Komjáth, C. Thomassen, S. Todorcevic, and S. Shelah.    Our main objective is to investigate ramification arguments between Ramsey-results of varying dimensions. In fact, (1) we study if graphs with uncountable chromatic number necessarily satisfy the same higher-dimensional negative partition relations as uncountable complete graphs.  We relate this theme to (2) the existence of orientations with large dichromatic number and partition relations on digraphs. Lastly, we explore a novel concept, (3) the existence of oscillation maps on the obligatory hypergraph associated to a graph with uncountable chromatic number.  Our program will be carried out through solving specific, often well-known open problems that are central to these themes. We aim to study both the purely combinatorial and the deep foundational issues that underlie these questions.  Hence, we will complement the use of advanced forcing techniques from set theory (such as mixed side-condition methods and new iteration preservation theorems) with novel combinatorial tools, such as minimal walks, oscillation maps and various ZFC construction scheme techniques. We expect our research to produce new methods of wide impact and a significantly deeper understanding of the interactions of finite and infinitary combinatorics.",False
"Title: FlexTrans - a universal thin film transistor platform for flexible and curved displays Abstract: SKEM proposes a project which will accelerate the uptake of their flexible transistor platform technology (incorporating their proprietary organic semiconductor, truFLEX), into backplane drivers for the manufacture of flexible and curved electronic displays. SKEM’s technology enables the low temperature processing of high performance transistors onto plastic for the first time. This allows mechanical flexibility to be combined with electronic performance previously only demonstrated by rigid inorganics, along with significant reductions to processing costs.
This will enable SKEM’s customers to produce entirely new form factors for display-based consumer electronics: flexible, body conforming, lightweight, unbreakable devices with high resolution and low power consumption (longer battery lifetimes). This can be achieved with low risk to adoption, using refitted standard production lines. As a universal transistor platform, SKEM will supply the existing market for liquid crystal displays (LCDs), while also facilitating the new market for organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.
The project will involve customer engagement (customers are already engaged in joint development work, showing commitment with signed Letters of Intent) and commercial planning (WP2), development of the technology platform to meet customer requirements (WP3), demonstration of the technology in full display devices (WP4) and preparation for commercial roll out, involving technology transfer to industrial process lines, and scale-up of truFLEX production (WP5). A strong regime of project management (WP1) dissemination and communication (WP6) will support the aims of the project. These developments will elevate the technology from initial demonstration in the relevant industrial application (TRL6 - first LCD demonstrator completed prior to project), to full commercial readiness after the project (TRL9). SKEM will obtain EUR 200m sales by 2023 at a viable price point of EUR4,000/litre.",True
"Title: SOLSTICE - Sodium-Zinc molten salt batteries for low-cost stationary storage Abstract: SOLSTICE answers the quest for stationary energy storage with two Na-Zn molten salt batteries, which operate at elevated temperature. The first concept benefits from the existing and successful ZEBRA® technology. Replacing their Ni-electrode by cheap and abundant Zn will only minimally affect other system parts thereby ensuring fast commercialisation. The second approach, an all-liquid cell, will apply the same chemistry, but does not require a ceramic electrolyte thus reducing cost further. Both battery concepts shall be brought to TRL5, and validated by four demonstrators, operating in a realistic environment at the end of the 4-year project. The demonstrators will be equipped with a self-learning battery management system and will be accompanied by upscaling, system integration and public acceptance studies. Na-Zn technology is exceptionally performant as it promises similar efficiency and depth of discharge as Li-ion cells, but extreme current densities. Featuring molten electrodes, Na-Zn cells actually work better when being cycled, as operation keeps them warm; several cycles per day and a lifetime exceeding 10,000 cycles can be legitimately expected. Na-Zn storage is perfectly sustainable: the raw materials, table salt and Zn, are abundant in the EU, cheap and not harmful. The environmental impact of Zn-mining and battery production is expected to be minimal. Finally, recycling is greatly simplified due to the large, molten electrodes. The most valuable element, Zn, can simply be recovered as pure metal and reused after dismantling the cells. Based on the existing knowledge on ZEBRA® battery production, the storage price of Na-Zn batteries is expected to approach 1 cent/kWh/cycle by 2030 - including balance-of-plant and recycling cost. Summing up, the Na-Zn technology is the cheapest molten-salt battery, is fully sustainable, fulfils all criteria of the call - and is even realistic to be commercialised by 2030.",False
"Title: MS SPIDOC - Mass Spectrometry for Single Particle Imaging of Dipole Oriented protein Complexes Abstract: The European XFEL has just entered user operation. With its unparalleled peak brilliance and repetition rate, European XFEL has the potential to further applications in single particle imaging (SPI), thus far limited to large viral particles at X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFEL). SPI will allow imaging protein complexes without the need for crystallization. This eventually renders transient conformational states accessible for high resolution structural studies yielding molecular movies of biomolecular machines. A major bottleneck is the wealth of data required to reconstruct a single structure leading to long processing times. This is currently also a problem in electron microscopy (EM).
MS SPIDOC will overcome this data challenge by developing a native mass spectrometry (MS) system for sample delivery, named X-MS-I. It will provide mass and conformation selected biomolecules, which are oriented along their dipole axis upon imaging. This will enable structural reconstruction from much smaller datasets speeding up the analysis time tremendously. Moreover, the system features low sample consumption and a controlled low background easing pattern identification.
The main objectives of the project are:
• Deliver mass and conformation separated biomolecules for SPI.
• Orient proteins for SPI.
• Image protein complex unfolding
• Exploit potential of protein orientation for other applications
The MS SPIDOC consortium combines internationally leading expertise in different fields relevant to the project: Instrument design and development, computer simulations as well as working with biomolecules in the gas phase and on SPI are combined to implement the novel sample environment at the next generation XFEL facility. New components and methods will be opened to the market and thereby strengthen the European Research Area (ERA) and industry. This early stage high-risk project will give rise to a new technology with major impact on how to derive structures of biomolecules.",False
"Title: PhilHumans - Personal Health Interfaces Leveraging Human-Machine Natural Interactions Abstract: The goal of the PhilHumans (Personal Health Interfaces Leveraging Human-MAchine Natural interactionS) project is to train a next generation of young researchers in innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and establish user interaction with their personal health devices in an advanced and intuitive way. PhilHumans will investigate cutting-edge AI methods for human-machine interaction in the personal health domain through a well-designed and structured research training programme, with the aim to enhance EU firms competitiveness in the field for an effective and lasting market penetration in EU.
The research in PhilHumans will be performed by an intersectoral and multidisciplinary consortium consisting of 8 ESRs and a team of supervisors from the academic beneficiaries (University of Cagliari, University of Catania, University of Aberdeen, and Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e)), the industrial beneficiaries (PHILIPS and R2M), and other external partners. The project will require the creation of a blend of interdisciplinary understanding of personal digital assistant, cognitive computing, (deep) machine learning, natural language generation & processing, advanced computer vision, and business development. The personal health areas that will be investigated are Mother&Child care, healthy-living and personal care, where the application of the proposed technology has promising potential.
All ESRs will enroll in a 3-years PhD research programme at beneficiary academic institutions. They are supposed to act as an integrated and complementary expertize team, whose aim is to tackle the fundamental challenge of combining heterogeneous data sources from multilingual speech/text processing and computer vision for improving conversation, detecting emotions, and improving social interactions. All the academic ESRs for at least 50% of their time will attend their secondment at PHILIPS, which will provide the required infrastructure and supervision by senior research staff.",False
"Title: TWEETHER - Traveling Wave Tube based W-band Wireless Networks with High Data Rate, Distribution, Spectrum and Energy Efficiency Abstract: Never technology has penetrated so deeply and fast in society everyday life as Internet has done in the last decades and is expected to do in the future. The enormous flux of data transferred via wireless networks, increasing at exponential pace, makes today’s state of the art networks soon outdated. Large parts of the society are deprived of adequate access to Internet due to the high costs, long deployment time of optical fibres and inadequate performance of wireless networks. This inequality will most likely pertain in the next years. 
Millimetre waves are the most promising solution to support the increasing data throughput and to be a credible fibre complement for the last miles.
The TWEETHER aim is to realise the millimetre wave Point to multi Point segment to finally link fibre, and sub-6GHz distribution for a full three segment hybrid network, that is the most cost-effective architecture to reach mobile or fixed final individual client. The TWEETHER project responds to the call H2020-ICT6, to foster smart wireless network architecture for high capacity everywhere outdoor data distribution, in gigabit class, that other technologies cannot support, at low operating cost. High spectrum and energy efficient W-band (92-95GHz) technology will be developed. A powerful and compact transmission hub based on a novel traveling wave tube power amplifier with performance precluded to any other technology and an advanced chipset in a compact terminal will be realised. The TWEETHER system will be tested in a real operating environment. Integrated smart networks of backhaul for 4G and 5G small cells and of access for residential houses are the targeted market that benefits from the actual light regulation of W-band. 
A big company Thales Electron Devices, four SMEs, Bluwan, OMMIC, HFSE, Fibernova, and three top Universities, Lancaster, Goethe Frankfurt, Politecnica de Valencia, join their expertise to successfully tackle the formidable challenges of the TWEETHER project.",True
"Title: WARMUSIC - The War on Music. Heritage, Islam and Peacekeeping in relation to the Islamist attacks in Mali Abstract: This project offers a critical approach to the recent phenomenon of the Islamist attacks on cultural heritage. Its objectives are to analyze 1) the performative and musical dimensions of Islamic identity during conflicts and 2) the global protection policies of the so-called “intangible heritage”. In addition, it aims at 3) building a new paradigm for post-conflict reconstruction and peacekeeping in collaboration with King’s College London experts and with international organizations (Secondment). The research develops around a central case-study: the attacks on music (formal interdictions, threats to musicians, destruction of musical instruments) that occurred during the Northern Mali occupation by armed groups claiming to be Islamists in 2012, and the intangible heritage protection and reconstruction programs implemented by the Malian Government, UNESCO, UN peace force and the European Union.  
The enquiry, based on an ethnographic methodology, develops around two specular sections. The first one, called “An Islam of development? Muslim Malian identities facing the war on music”, is dedicated to the musical negotiations of Muslim identities during the insurgency, the role of Islamic organizations in cultural development and the local perceptions of international cultural aid. The second one, “Preserving others’ culture. International policies on intangible heritage”, focuses on the conceptual frame and concrete protection measures defined by heritage institutions in the context of Malian peacekeeping. This double focus enables a comparison between two different ontologies, “religion” and “development”, for a broader understanding of the reasons why culture is targeted, banned and reconstructed as a result of the confluence of current trends in conflicts and globalization. Finally, the project intends to enlarge the academic debate concerning the recent Islamist cultural attacks, encouraging new forms of collaboration with international organizations.",False
"Title: ssmscaifa - The Making of Modernist Resistance, 1880-1950 Abstract: The vibrant diversity of an increasingly global modernity owes much to the cross-cultural exchanges between British and Indian modernists during their collaborations in civil rights, anti-colonial, and anti-fascist activism from the 1880s to the 1950s. The proposed project examines the shifting nature of literary and political contributions to activist movements made by four such networks of British and Indian modernists to illuminate their integral role in creating what I contend is a distinctively modernist resistance. As early as the 1880s, theosophists from Britain partnered with renowned Indian spiritualists to bridge cultural gaps between colonizer and colonized through shared mystical experiences to emphasize an innate unity among human beings. By 1919, however, the disillusionment following World War I coupled with India’s outrage about the Amritsar Massacre in which General Dyer and his troops opened fire killing hundreds of innocent Indians, supplanted such yearnings for unity with efforts to protect democratic freedoms from threats by right-wing extremists through a secular socialist resistance. Mulk Raj Anand, initially drawn to the liberal humanism of the Bloomsbury Group eventually joined the radical socialists of India’s Progressive Writers Association in 1936. Women like Sarojini Naidu and Virginia Woolf fought for women’s equality and opportunities to join in anti-right-wing resistance. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, influenced by the socialist ideologies of the Fabian Society, incorporated them into Indian nationalism and governance. This study explores the relationship between the ideologies of these networks to establish what the shift from spiritualism to secular socialist nationalism reveals about the nature of modernist resistance and the conditions of modernity that inspired it. The world view underpinning this resistance was integral in defining the post-war identities of Britain and India as secular socialist-leaning democracies.",True
"Title: QUARTET - Quantum readout techniques and technologies Abstract: The general aim of this proposal is to exploit quantum information to develop new powerful methods for the retrieval and recognition of classical data from physical systems. More precisely, we aim at showing a substantial quantum-enhancement in several fundamental tasks: (1) the readout of classical data from digital memories (quantum reading); (2) the recognition of classical patterns (quantum pattern recognition); (3) the optical measurement of concentration in fragile biomedical samples (quantum bio-probing); and (4) the microwave detection of target objects (microwave quantum illumination or quantum radar). These objectives are realized starting from the optimization of a general theoretical model at their basis: quantum channel discrimination. This is then developed into technical aspects which directly support our experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations.

Our experimental prototypes could open the way to much more powerful and radically new forms of information and detection technologies, with direct benefit for science and the wider society. Thanks to the superior performances in the low energy regime, quantum reading may increase data-transfer rates and storage capacities of current digital memories by orders of magnitude. Quantum pattern recognition could have remarkable long-term applications in biology and medicine, in terms of non-invasive analysis of very fragile biological samples or human tissues, and better recognizing hidden patterns associated to bacterial growths or cancerous cells. Such results could provide future non-invasive techniques of medical imaging for private and public hospitals. Finally, the realization of a working prototype of a quantum radar may have non-trivial applications for the European security technology.",True
"Title: PAMMOTH - Photoacoustic/Ultrasound Mammoscopy for evaluating screening-detected abnormalities in the breast Abstract: X-ray mammography is the mainstay of breast cancer screening programs. It is estimated that between 20 - 50% of abnormal screening mammograms will prove to be negative. The paradigm in diagnosis is to establish whether a lesion is benign or malignant. All the imaging techniques conventionally used today – diagnostic x-ray, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging have many limitations, leading to multiple and/or repeat imaging and often unnecessary biopsy. This leads to physical, psychological and economic burdens felt at individual, familial and societal levels.  

With an aging population, high incidence of breast cancer and tightening health-care budgets, there is an urgent  requirement for a non-invasive method for in-depth assessment of the screening-detected lesion. In PAMMOTH we will showcase such an imager, combining photoacoustic  and ultrasound imaging. With the use of quantitative image reconstruction of multi-wavelength photoacoustic data, information is gained of the vascular and oxygen status of the lesion relating to tumor physiology and function. From the ultrasound part, we derive ultrasound reflection from the lesion in a manner superior to conventional breast ultrasonography, relating to anatomic features and extent of a tumor. This information will enable the radiologist to come to a diagnosis accurately and rapidly without the use of contrast agents, without pain and  discomfort to the patient, while being cost-effective and not requiring complex infrastructure. 

Four excellent academic groups, three dynamic SMEs, and a hospital come together with support from key stakeholders in an Advisory group, to push beyond the state-of-the-art in science and technology to achieve the PAMMOTH imager. For the SMEs, in addition to tremendous improvements in individual product lines, the new integrated diagnostic imaging instrument opens up completely new market opportunities. 

We expect PAMMOTH to have a strong economic and clinical impact.",False
"Title: e-Safe - Novel low-cost ground penetrating radar system for safe, simple and swift detection of all utilities piping and cabling located underground Abstract: Across Europe and the world, the installation of underground utility services continues to grow. The ground beneath Europe’s cities streets, which already contains a myriad of pipelines and cables, is rapidly becoming over congested. For example, the city of Rome’s 3million inhabitants are serviced by 65,000km of buried pipes and cables. Due to this congestion, delivery of vital utilities through the installation and maintenance of new and existing underground services is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous. The personnel working in the various utilities sectors (telecoms, water, gas, electricity etc.) face daily challenges with regard safe excavation for installation and maintenance.

With limited utility detection solutions available on the market and the general absence of accurate underground piping and cabling records, accidents and damage to these utilities is occurring on a large scale. Maintenance contractors are causing 90,000 incidences of third party damage to EU gas pipelines alone annually. In a North American study, it was found that 25% of incidences are due to insufficient locating practice. The impact of such damage is wide-ranging; approximately 120 deaths and 6,000 serious injuries are attributed to contact with the electricity network occur in Europe every year, while repair costs for damaged services can run into many millions of euros.

The above problem demands urgent action. There is a clear need for a cost effective, rapid, compact, high performance “all services avoidance” solution that ensures the safety of utilities maintenance personnel, prevents utilities damage, and speeds up location of safe excavation zones. PipeHawk Plc has developed a totally unique system (e-Safe) that addresses all these needs. Our innovation project will bring the e-Safe system, currently at TRL6, to market readiness. We expect to capture up to 5% of the global market, generate annual profits of €16.4million, & create 70 new jobs by yr 5 post project.",True
"Title: JUCLFUT - Towards a Just Climate Future? Urban sustainability, financialization, and the global housing crisis Abstract: Climate change is a complex problem that requires solutions that reach across the boundaries between local and global and economic and ecological spheres of policy and everyday life. The challenge of ensuring that the benefits and burdens of transitioning to a carbon neutral future are equitably distributed within and across communities is thus one of the most pressing currently facing humanity.  
Pensions have recently emerged as key actors in the pursuit of “green” investment, due to their fiduciary duties and the sensitivity of physical assets to political, regulatory and environmental effects of climate change (Government of Canada, 2018; Gold and Scotchmer, 2015; OPTrust, 2018; Mercer, 2018). At the same time, their involvement in the financialization of housing (e.g. turning housing into a pure commodity, severed from its social function as shelter) is exacerbating the global housing crisis, making it increasingly difficult for growing numbers of people to access their human rights to shelter (August, 2019; Farha, 2019; Parish, 2019b). Furthermore, even while COVID-19 has made the right to housing all the more urgent, the economic fallout from the pandemic is exacerbating the crisis as growing numbers of people are now at risk of mortgage default and eviction.  
This project therefore investigates the social effects of specific green housing projects financed by pension capital in order to assess the extent to which these investments are addressing climate objectives in a manner which also respects the internationally recognized human right to safe, adequate and affordable housing, and conforms to the imperative of a just transition, as defined by the EU as one which is “inclusive for all” and where “no person or place is left behind”.  
The central Research Question this project will answer is: What are the social and gendered effects of pension backed investments in green housing infrastructure on households and communities?",False
"Title: WARNTRAK - Rail track monitoring system - Wireless Autonomous On-Board System measuring vibration with continuous reporting to reduce maintenance costs and enhance reliability and safety. Abstract: Rail track monitoring system - real time information on track condition from vibration sensors on rolling stock to enhance safety, improve reliability and reduce costs.

Real time live condition monitoring of rail track is not currently available and this project will provide that capability.  This will deliver major benefits through cost reductions of rail track maintenance as well as improved train safety and operational reliability
. 
The technology capability, supported by the WiBRATE FP7 project, has been proven by 5,000 installations in three EU countries for rolling stock condition monitoring. The low cost self-contained wireless sensors are easily fitted in minutes, powered by Perpetuum's world leading vibration energy harvesters.

A prototype track monitoring system has demonstrated the new concept. WARNTRAK will deliver a fully functional system by further improvements, prototyping, testing and trials. This is a world leading capability with massive potential for worldwide sales and accelerated profitable growth through the clear benefits for rail operators. . 

WARNTRAK, using in-service train mounted sensors to measure track condition live and continuously rather than occasional data from measurement trains, will
- Identify degradation trends and rapid deterioration immediately
- Optimise track maintenance programmes by enabling early intervention and prioritisation
- Reduce the required frequency of measurement train passes, freeing up rail capacity and hence reducing the cost
- Improve track availability by prioritising engineering repairs before speed restrictions become necessary.
- Reduce damage to rolling stock and help prevent derailment by improving track condition
- Reduce resource use; energy, material and manpower.

The system can be fully implemented throughout Europe with no interoperability issues and exported worldwide. It will deliver the information collection, processing and visualisation tools to drive accurate track maintenance.",True
"Title: DAMOSET - With data-driven modelling towards a successful energy transition Abstract: The power grid is an integral part of the power system. It connects all electrical consumers with generators and powers everything from household appliances to large factory machinery. Without this grid, farmers would not be able to feed their animals, car factories would come to a halt, mobile phone systems would fail and many of us would not even be able to make a cup of tea. While the current power system is very reliable and offers a high quality of service, it remains unclear how this will develop in the future. The limited supply of fossil fuels as well as necessary reduction of CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, will eventually lead to a power grid mainly supplied by renewable generators, such as wind and solar plants. These plants output smaller total power so that a large number is necessary which have to be geographically distributed for optimal weather conditions. The current power grid system slowly emerged within several decades of optimization processes. However, now we are discussing how to revolutionize the whole energy system within years. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the current power system is necessary to develop potential pathways to a future 100% sustainable system. In the proposed research, I will use data-driven approaches to work towards a quantitative understanding of fluctuations in the power grid, as they are for example introduced by the changing demand or volatile energy generation. I will analyse the British as well as international grids to understand differences in grid operation and potential solutions for grids. A key goal of the proposed project is to offer a data base of these measurements for the scientific community to analyse and to add to. Within this project, I will also develop analysis tools to be used by the scientific community as well as interested companies or government agencies.",True
"Title: SYNCHRO-NET - Synchro-modal Supply Chain Eco-Net Abstract: SYNCHRO-NET will demonstrate how a powerful and innovative SYNCHRO-modal supply chain eco-NET can catalyse the uptake of the slow steaming concept and synchro-modality, guaranteeing cost-effective robust solutions that de-stress the supply chain to reduce emissions and costs for logistics operations while simultaneously increasing reliability and service levels for logistics users.
The core of the SYNCHRO-NET solution will be an integrated optimisation and simulation eco-net, incorporating: real-time synchro-modal logistics optimisation (e-Freight-enabled);  slow steaming ship simulation & control systems; synchro-modal risk/benefit analysis statistical modelling; dynamic stakeholder impact assessment solution;  and a synchro-operability communications and governance architecture.
Perhaps the most important output of SYNCHRO-NET will be the demonstration that slow steaming, coupled with synchro-modal logistics optimisation delivers amazing benefits to all stakeholders in the supply chain: massive reduction in emissions for shipping and land-based transport due to modal shift to greener modes AND optimised planning processes leading to reduced empty kms for trucks and fewer wasted repositioning movements.
This will lead to lower costs for ALL stakeholders – shipping companies and logistics operators will benefit from massive reduction in fuel usage, faster turnaround times in ports & terminals and increased resource utilisation/efficiency. Customers and end users will have greater control of their supply chain, leading to more reliable replenishment activity and therefore reduced safety stocks and expensive warehousing. Authorities and governmental organisations will benefit from a smoother, more controlled flow of goods through busy terminals, and reduction of congestion on major roads, thus maximising the utilisation of current infrastructure and making the resourcing of vital activities such as import/export control, policing and border security less costly.",True

"Title: VISMEM - Visualising memories of violence in urban places: gender and wellbeing in Istanbul Abstract: Evidence shows that violence in urban areas affects women of all ages, socio economic and cultural backgrounds in particular (WHO 2014). The immediate and extensive costs of violence targeting women perpetuate the existing gender hierarchies by setting boundaries on women’s movement, mobility, presence: that is, on their use of urban space. In addition to restrictions in mainstream social life, gendered violence is a systemic source of experiencing helplessness, humiliation, and distress which overall are a fundamental component of women’s wellbeing. VISMEM will investigate the impact of place-based memories of violence among diverse women for their use of urban space, and interrogate the utility of visual methods for understanding that impact. More precisely, the study uses visual methods to explore diverse women’s everyday negotiations of space in Istanbul, focusing in particular on their movements in relation to three research sites where forms of violence against women have occurred. VISMEM’s overall objective is to develop a conceptual framework and visual tools for multisector policy and research engagement with memory as a key means to locate, assess, and ameliorate women's differential experience of violence and wellbeing in the city. Women in different social and spatial settings remember (and forget) the physical and mental effects of violence through personal experience and through popular accounts of its effects. The differential workings of memory in turn have implications on the lived experiences and wellbeing of a city's current (and future) residents/visitors. Yet, the nexus of memory, place, gender remains disconnected from the multisector urban agenda on difference, inclusion, and wellbeing. VISMEM will provide transferable knowledge and policy-related results on the relation between gendered violence, memory, and will greatly improve our understanding of place memory as a focus in achieving gender-goals in urban social and spatial integration.",True
"Title: REVERSE - pREVention and management tools for rEducing antibiotic Resistance in high prevalence Settings Abstract: Emerging antibiotic resistance has become an endemic problem, slowly increasing under the radar and depriving future generations of effective therapies. The goal of REVERSE is to develop and implement cost-effective strategies and tools for the prevention and clinical management of healthcare-associated infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens, and to reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance in high prevalence healthcare settings. To achieve these goals, REVERSE will use a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative research with implementation science and economic analysis. The aim is to produce results that go beyond the evidence-base we have today. REVERSE will answer the question about real-life effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes in combination with antibiotic stewardship on healthcare-associated infections due to multidrug-resistant microorganisms. It will offer implementation strategies to the participating hospitals but also study the effectiveness of external implementation support in a hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. REVERSE will develop a novel health-economic framework that allows for incorporating of effect of changes in the use of a range of antibiotics on antibiotic resistant infections, and estimating long-term population effects, to integrate both into cost-effectiveness analyses. It will be able to conclude on effectiveness and applicability of prevention strategies in lower-resource settings by cross-checking its programmes with activities in low-and-middle income countries.  Four European countries will have a platform of highly experienced hospitals to build on and expand a national network for combatting antibiotic resistance. REVERSE will produce tools and bundles on infection prevention and control, antibiotic stewardship and implementation support. Massive online open courses and other dissemination strategies will make the findings of REVERSE accessible to a wide range of stakeholders.",True
"Title: TCBI - Tracking children in their best interests: electronic monitoring in three European juvenile justice systems Abstract: The implementation of alternatives to deprivation of liberty throughout the juvenile justice procedure has been on the agenda of international children’s rights for about 28 years. The urgent need for alternatives is based on the requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of Child to use measures that deprive children’s liberty as last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. Accordingly, states have to develop suitable alternatives to detaining children for justice purposes. One of the currently popular alternative measures is surveillance of juvenile offenders by using electronic monitoring (EM) devices. EM ensures control through GPS or radio frequency technology, allowing juveniles to remain in or return to the community and maintain their ties with their families and peers. Although these measures seem to be popular among policy makers because of the high level of control, concerns are also raised about their harmful effects, which may be significant in childhood. 
This research investigates how the application of EM suits the requirements set out by international documents on children’s rights and how national or international policies may be improved towards a better compliance with children’s best interests. The research will be implemented in England and Wales, Hungary and The Netherlands, using a variety of qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (survey) methods to investigate the research questions. The project will generate unique knowledge on multiple aspects of using EM measures in juvenile justice, which will, for the first time, develop understanding at a European level about EM from the perspective of children. It will demonstrate a unique, children’s rights approach and involve different actors of the system, juvenile offenders and children, who will be approached via a number of channels. During the research, special attention will be paid to provide child-friendly and age-sensitive information where necessary.",True
"Title: ConPLED - Nanostructured Confined ABX3 Perovskite based Light-Emitting Devices Abstract: The development of low-cost, clean, and scalable energy solutions is imperative to securing a peaceful and sustainable future. Optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) incorporating new, inexpensive materials show tremendous promise to alter the energy landscape by reducing the cost of energy consumption. However, the widespread adoption of LEDs demands new technologies to surpass the luminous efficacies of conventional LED light while having a full control over colour, brightness and directionality of the light source. Recently, a new class of semiconducting materials, ABX3 perovskites, is poised to revolutionise the LED field due to its ease of processing and outstanding electronic and optical properties. In this context, the ultimate goal of this proposal is the development of the first efficient white light LED based on luminescent nanostructured perovskites that feature tuneable on-demand emission properties. ConPLED will result in an alternative to commercial white LEDs, with the additional gain of having finely tuneable electroluminescence based on cost-effective materials processed at low temperature. The combination of perovskite nanocrystals that show quantum confinement effects with photonic nanostructures, an area where the researcher has demonstrated proficiency, will lead to fine control over the colour gamut, and the angular bandwidth of light emission. A deep understanding of the electro-optical and structural properties of such nanostructured emitting materials will lead to demonstrate efficient white light LEDs, which is one of the main activities of the Optoelectronics group at Cavendish Laboratory (University of Cambridge). The project covers the experimental realization of materials and their integration in devices as well as advanced characterization and performance tests, all of which lies in the common ground of physicists, chemists and technologists and, thus, will naturally broaden the area of expertise of the researcher.",False
"Title: FENTEC - Functional Encryption Technologies Abstract: Functional encryption (FE), has been recently been introduced as a new paradigm of encryption systems to overcome all-or-nothing limitations of classical encryption. In an FE system the decryptor deciphers a function over the message plaintext: such functional decryptability makes it feasible to process encrypted data (e.g. on the Internet) and obtain a partial view of the message plaintext. This extra flexibility over classical encryption is a powerful enabler for many emerging security technologies (i.e. controlled access, searching and computing on encrypted data, program obfuscation…). 
FENTEC’s mission is to make the functional encryption paradigm ready for wide-range applications, integrating it in ICT technologies as naturally as classical encryption. The primary objective is the efficient and application-oriented development of functional encryption systems. FENTEC’s team of cryptographers, software and hardware experts and information technology industry partners that will document functional encryption needs of specific applications and subsequently design, develop, implement and demonstrate applied use of functional cryptography. 
Ultimately, a functional encryption library for both SW and HW-oriented application will be documented and made public so that it may be used by European ICT entities. With it, the FENTEC team will build emerging security technologies that increase the trustworthiness of the European ICT services and products. Concretely, the FENTEC team will showcase the expressiveness and versatility of the functional encryption paradigm in 3 use cases:
• Privacy-preserving digital currency, enforcing flexible auditing models
• Anonymous data analytics enabling computation of statistics over encrypted data, protecting European Fundamental Rights of Data Protection and Privacy
• Key and content distribution with improved performance & efficiency as foundational technology for establishing secure communication among a vast amount of IOT devices.",False
"Title: E-LOBSTER - Electric LOsses Balancing through  integrated  STorage and power Electronics towards increased synergy between Railways and electricity distribution networks Abstract: European distribution networks and light-railway networks present common issues: both have been developed as independent networks, relying on the resilience and robustness of existing power supplies. However, RES progressive penetration introduced an increasing degree of uncertainty on the direction of power flows. Both networks are looking at integrated solutions targeting: i) reduction of electricity losses ii) increase the grid stability in a high local RES penetration scenario iii) accommodate the needs of new energy actors such as EVs, electrical storages and prosumers. Electrified transport networks such as light railways could act to enhance distribution grid stability providing ancillary services inter-exchanging electricity. However such potential is still unexploited. E-LOBSTER intends to capture such potential through the development of an innovative, economically viable and easily replicable electric Transport-Grid Inter-Connection System that will be able to establish synergies between power distribution networks, electrified transport networks (metro, trams, light railways etc.) and charging stations for EVs. The proposed solution encompasses the integration of high power flow Electric Storage with smart Soft Open Points providing flexible control. The system will be managed by an integrated Railway + Grid Management System which starting from the real time analysis of energy losses will be able to optimize the interexchange of electricity between the networks maximizing local RES self-consumption. The hardware and software control platform will be demonstrated at TRL 6 in one substation owned by Metro de Madrid. Business models and standardisation needs will be deeply analyzed and measures to unlock existing barriers will be promoted and in parallel the knowledge generated from the project will be further exploited for the definition of the up-scale design of a full scale E-LOBSTER system, paving the ground towards replication across the EU.",False
"Title: STUSOCSTA - Students, social change and the construction of the post-independence Algerian state, 1962-1978 Abstract: This project seeks to bring a new perspective to understanding state construction in Algeria after independence. Through a history of the first generations of Algerians who went to university in the 1960s and 1970s, it explores the intersections between political and institutional transformations and social, cultural and economic processes. These processes include increasing literacy, rural to urban migration, migration to study abroad and changes in gender relations and family structures. Bringing together concepts and methodologies from across a number of humanities and social science disciplines, the project will produce a case study setting out new approaches to studying state-building as a dynamic process which takes place at different levels of power (transnational, national and local) and which both shapes, and is shaped by, individual agency and wider processes. The goal is for this approach to be applicable to a range of other post-colonial contexts, challenging teleological readings of post-independence histories and homogenising understandings of post-independence states. 

The project is to be carried out in Algeria, France and the UK, with the researcher working with leading experts in the field in each of these countries to create a transnational, interdisciplinary network exploring the central research themes. Through extensive interviewing of former students, this project will create a new body of sources for researchers, which will also, with informants’ consent, be made accessible online. Public engagement is integral to the research design and process of data collection as well as dissemination, with Algerian students from the 1960s and 1970s invited to participate in group testimony sessions, alongside the wider public, throughout the project.",True

ISIGrowth will be policy focussed, with policies emerging from a strong interaction between key theoretical insights (e.g. from Schumpeterian economics of innovation and Keynesian demand policies), with key empirical studies (using cutting edge methods in complexity science, non parametric statistics, as well as detailed case studies of business and industry histories). This theoretical and empirical interaction will be embedded in a dynamic process of engagement with stakeholders in our cutting edge and innovative Civil Action Network (CAN) and Business Forum (BF).",False
"Title: RemovAL - Removing the waste streams from the primary Aluminium production and other metal sectors in Europe Abstract: The answer to the current Raw Material supply challenge faced today in Europe,  lies in technological innovations that increase the efficiency of resource utilization and allow the exploitation of yet untapped resources such as industrial waste streams and metallurgical by-products. One of the key industrial residues which is currently not or poorly valorised is Bauxite Residue (BR, more commonly known as “red mud”) from alumina refineries. Bauxite residue reuse solutions do exist as stand-alone but pooling them together in an integrated manner is the only way to render bauxite residue reuse viable from an economical point of view and acceptable for the industry
The RemovAl project will combine, optimize and scale-up developed processing technologies for extracting base and critical metals from such industrial residues and valorising the remaining processing residues in the construction sector.  
In term of technological aspects, RemovAl will process several by-products from the aluminium sector and from other metallurgical sectors in Europe (SiO2 by-products, SPL, fly ash,and others). The different waste streams will be combined to allow for optimal and viable processing in different technological pilot nodes. The technologies and pilots in most cases have already been developed in previous or ongoing projects and through RemovAl they will be pooled together and utilized in a European industrial symbiosis network. 
In term of societal or non-technological aspects, RemovAl will gather key sectors like the non-ferrous metal and cement sectors in order to secure a true industrial symbiosis through a top-down approach considering also legislation and standardisation at European level in order to facilitate the implementation of the most promising technical solutions.",False
"Title: FIBRING - Fibring of manifolds and groups Abstract: The study of manifolds that fibre over the circle has a long and exciting history at the core of modern manifold topology, starting with Farrell's work on the problem in high ('surgery') dimensions, and running through the celebrated work of Stallings and Thurston in dimension 3, to Agol's 2013 solution of Thurston's virtual fibring conjecture. Parallel developments in group theory have placed the study of Bieri-Neumann-Strebel (BNS) invariants, which emerged in the 1980s, at the heart of the subject; these invariants describe when a group fibres, i.e. admits a map onto Z with finitely generated kernel. In the research outlined here a powerful new set of algebraic invariants - agrarian polytopes - will be used to establish a new frontier in the theory of fibring. The main goal is to achieve a complete description of all possible fibrings over the circle for aspherical manifolds in surgery dimensions.

An agrarian polytope is a subset of the vector space H_1(X;R), where X is a group or a manifold. It is defined in the novel framework of agrarian invariants that I am developing, a theory that has already borne remarkable fruit. The theory provides algebraic counterparts to the (analytic) L2-invariants that have proved so powerful in geometric topology, group theory and global analysis over the last four decades.

The primary focus of the research proposed here lies in establishing new deep connections between the algebra of group rings and their completions, and global properties of aspherical manifolds and groups. Three further goals of the proposal are: to develop the theory of agrarian invariants in positive characteristic; to show that agrarian invariants are profinitely rigid; to apply the new technology to the study of dynamical zeta functions. Each of these goals promises a breakthrough in its respective domain.",False
"Title: TrainMALTA - Interdisciplinary Training in High-Throughput Sequencing, Bioinformatics and Model Systems: Moving towards Clinical applications of Genomics Abstract: This proposal is designed to expedite capacity building in Malta through training in Bioinformatics for the analysis of High-Throughput Sequencing data (HTS), Epigenomics and Model Systems for the validation of candidates identified by HTS. 
Falling costs and accessibility to HTS technologies has made it easier for researchers to generate the data. The bottleneck is the data processing, analysis and integration of HTS data generated from different applications (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics) and validation of candidate genes and mutations identified through HTS. To this end, this Twinning action will focus on the transfer and exchange of knowledge between expert groups from two internationally-leading research institutions, the University of Cambridge (UCAM) and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), and scientists, postgraduates and academics from the University of Malta (UoM); through varied forms of training such as  summer schools, online tutoring and mentoring, training workshops, exchanges and expert visits, networking and collaborations. The specific focus of this action will be to provide training on best-practices in bioinformatic analysis, integration of HTS data (including whole genomes and epigenomes), robust quantitative analytical methods as well as training in the use of model systems: the zebrafish model  and induced pluripotent stem cells; iPSCs. 
These activities will significantly strengthen the knowledge base at UoM; and, by increasing the research profile of the University, help promote the participation of Malta in future EU research programmes. Furthermore, there will also be advancements in science and technology which will benefit regional and European socio-economic development.",False
"Title: RADIOFOREGROUNDS - Ultimate modelling of Radio foregrounds: a key ingredient for cosmology Abstract: Understanding the Physics of Inflation is one of the key questions in present-day fundamental cosmology.  For this purpose, the study of the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies provide a unique probe to the early Universe. However, it is well-known that foreground signals, and in particular emission from our Galaxy, will be the major limiting factor of the possible constraints on the existence of B-modes.

This proposal will make use of ESA’s PLANCK satellite mission (30-857 GHz), in combination with the ground-based observations provided by the QUIJOTE experiment (10-20 GHz) and other ancillary radio maps, to address the still open problem of  the detailed physical modelling of the radio foregrounds in polarization. This project will provide: a) state-of-the-art legacy maps of the synchrotron and  the anomalous microwave emission (AME) in the Northern sky; b) a detailed characterization of the synchrotron spectral index, and the implications for cosmic-rays electron physics; c) a model of the large-scale properties of the Galactic magnetic field; d) a detailed characterization of the AME, including its contribution in polarization; and e) the best complete and statistically significant multi-frequency catalogue (from 10 to 217 GHz) of radio sources in both temperature and polarization. 
 
The combination of PLANCK and QUIJOTE will provide reference data products which will be an asset  for other sub-orbital experiments, as well as in the preparation of future space missions. Finally, we will also provide specific software tools for a more efficient exploitation of our data products, with functionalities far beyond of the existing ones. These tools will not only allow an advanced visualization, but also they will allow the possibility of carrying out specific predictions/simulations for the design of future B-mode experiments, which we expect it will be widely used by the Cosmology and Astrophysics community.",False
"Title: QUDOT-TECH - Quantum Dots for Photonic Quantum Information Technologies Abstract: Quantum physics has had a revolutionary impact on industry and society in the past century, giving birth to the semiconductor industry and the resulting first generation of quantum devices (computers, TVs, smartphones etc.). Whereas semiconductor physics has arisen from quantum science, the engineering principles of these first generation devices have remained anchored on classical physics. We are presently at the verge of a second revolution of quantum science, where quantum engineering based on direct exploitation of fundamental quantum mechanical abilities such as superposition and entanglement promises entire new technologies for society. However, lack of scalability of quantum information (QI) technology remains the fundamental technical challenge preventing most QI technologies from becoming a reality - a critical bottleneck to which a new generation of researchers is urgently needed. In QUDOT-TECH we build from the semiconductor QD - the most mature QI technology - and propose a solution to the scalability obstacle in the form of a quantum network based on QDs coupled efficiently to each other using optical waveguides. We will construct the world’s first platform for fully integrated on-chip QI processing, a cornerstone potentially equivalent to the silicon transistor in the first generation of quantum devices. As this is frontier research, current doctoral research programmes do not provide the required interdisciplinary skillset and the entrepreneurial-like mind-set required to secure application-oriented breakthroughs within the QI field. Hereto, we have gathered the best European academic and industrial partners to train 15 ESRs to an outstanding level, where they can act as Europe’s future leaders within QI technology. The QUDOT-TECH ESRs will fill in a much needed link between academia and industry and will make the new technology widely available through one or more spin-out companies - ultimately propelling Europe to leadership at the global scale.",True
"Title: RuKNOW - Knowledge on International Relations in Russia Abstract: Against the backdrop of EU-Russia relations reaching the lowest point since the end of the Cold War, this project is dedicated to understanding what representations and principles underscore Russian policies vis-à-vis the EU, by specifically exploring the relations between Russian academic knowledge of world politics and Russian foreign policymaking. This entails examining the interface between the academy and the world of policymaking, i.e. common and intermediary structures between the two worlds enabling people, training and knowledge to travel between them. None of these areas has been subject to detailed study with regard to Russia. The objectives of the project therefore are: (1) to identify the major concepts, theoretical frameworks and empirical concerns that characterize the Russian study of Russia-EU relations; (2) to pinpoint the dominant narratives on Russia-EU relations produced by the policy world; (3) to identify the structures and frameworks of exchange, homology and mimetism between the academic and policy-making fields in Russia; (4) to identify the content and form of the actual exchange of knowledge and expertise between the academy and the field of policymaking. This close focus on Russia makes it essential for this study to be carried out under the Global Fellowship framework. The meeting of research objectives and the achievement of training goals require the development of ties and collaboration with the Russian academia and continued exposure to Russian policy-making environment. The innovative nature of this cross-disciplinary project consists in proposing an alternative approach to examining Russian foreign policy and in the application of a rich methodological framework to capture the different dimensions - institutional, cultural, ideological - of the knowledge-policy interface. The carrying out of this research at academic institutions in Russia and the EU will enhance scholarly collaboration across the current political divide.",False

"Title: CreepUT - An ultrasonic non-destructive testing system for detection and quantification of early stage subsurface creep damage in the thermal power generation industry Abstract: Creep damage detection in pressurised steam line components is a major concern in the power generation industry. Currently, replica metallography is used to inspect these components. This method can only detect surface defects however evidence indicates that creep damage develops first inside the pipe wall and does not appear at the wall surface until the pipe is almost ready to fail. This results in catastrophic component failures which cost the industry more than €500,000 in lost revenue per day out of operation. 
To combat this, we will commercialise the CreepUT system, which employs a proprietary Ultrasonic (UT) technique that enables the early detection of sub-surface creep damage. We are an industrially driven consortium with significant expertise in field inspection services and NDT product development. We have already tested and validated the capabilities of CreepUT in relevant environment but require about €2.5 million to evolve our system from TRL-6 to TRL-9 and speed-up the delivery of the CreepUT product into the market place. We plan to refine the hardware electronics and make our system more ergonomic to be used by technicians. 

A major part of the project is focused on validating the performance of the system in an industrial power plant; in this effort, we are supported by PPC, one of Greece’s top energy companies. Activities will target towards certifying the CreepUT product, fine tuning our marketing plan, approaching new customers and setting-up our customer services department. 
We will penetrate the fossil and nuclear power generation industry in UK, Greece, France, Saudi Arabia, India and China. We calculate total revenues of €14.59million by 2024, operating at a profit of €2.05 million and creating 42 new jobs. The power generation industry will benefit from reduced outage periods; hence the power plants will operate safer and for longer saving the industry about €32 million per year.",False

"Title: SMARTWISE - Smart Miniaturized and Energy Autonomous Regional Aircraft Wireless Sensor Abstract: The objective of the proposed project is to develop a smart, miniaturized and energy autonomous wireless sensor platform dedicated to data collection for the Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS) of future multi mission regional aircrafts.
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in aircrafts requires data acquisition from various sensors distributed over the aircraft skin. Among them are strain, shock/acceleration, sound pressure, rotation and temperature sensors. Today such sensors are wired and installing many of them on aircrafts have a high negative impact on weight and wiring complexity. Thus it is believed that collecting data using smart, easy to install self-powered wireless sensors would strengthen the competitiveness of the European aviation industry by providing the much desired SHMS function with very limited impact on complexity and weight and greatly ease maintenance operations. 
Precisely, the SMARTWISE consortium ambitions to realise a self-powered versatile wireless sensor network platform dedicated to structural health monitoring with with specific objectives:
- The proposed concept shall reduce the weight of a comparable wired SHMS system by at least 60%.
- The prototype wireless sensors that will be delivered at the end of the project shall rely exclusively on self-generated energy (no pre-flight charging, cold start supported) and comply with the flight test regulations that will be agreed with the topic manager.
- With respect to comparable wired solutions, the proposed wireless SHM system shall expose a potential of 50% installation and maintenance costs reduction.
- The wireless SHM sensor network, including its power supply and on-board data processing parts shall cover 100% of the SHMS application requirements.

"Title: COSMOS - Control and measurement of single macromolecules in space and time Abstract: The desire to “freely suspend the constituents of matter” in order to study their behaviour can be traced back over 200 years to Lichtenberg’s diaries. From radio-frequency ion traps to optical tweezing of colloidal particles, existing methods to trap matter in free space or solution rely on the use of external fields that often strongly perturb the integrity of a macromolecule in solution. Recently, I invented the ‘electrostatic fluidic trap’, a “field-free” principle that supports stable, non-destructive confinement of single macromolecules in room temperature fluids, representing a paradigm shift in a nearly century-old field. The spatio-temporal dynamics of a single electrostatically trapped molecule reveals fundamental information on its properties, e.g., size and electrical charge. The charge of a macromolecule is in turn a strong function of its 3D conformation - the molecular basis of biological function. I now aim to develop a new platform to study 3D macromolecular structure and temporal conformation by measuring the electrical charge of a single trapped molecule in real time, using both optical microscopy and electrical detection. Beyond the conformational dynamics of a single molecule, we will also examine interactions between two or more molecules, and the detection of minute structural differences between closely related molecular isoforms. We will further develop a novel approach to electrical transport measurements on single molecules aimed at generating for the first time a catalog of ‘electrical signatures’ for biomolecules in solution. The ability to experimentally link electrical charge and molecular structure will not only open up a new physical dimension in our understanding of macromolecules, but also advance the development of ultrasensitive, high-throughput molecular sensors for biomedical detection and analytics, potentially enabling an optical or electrical “single-snapshot” read-out of the proteome or transcriptome of a single cell.",True
"Title: BEATRICE - Beyond Massive MIMO: Living at the Interface of Electromagnetics and Information Theory Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MaMi) is now a core technology for 5G networks. With MaMi, we refer to systems with an unconventionally large number (e.g. hundreds or even thousands) of base station antennas simultaneously serving tens (or even hundreds) of users. To date, the development of MaMi has been exclusively based on information theory (IT) tailored towards cellular communications. While IT is undoubtedly a versatile mathematical tool, it is based on mathematical logic. This theoretical framework now needs to be extended and reshaped to: (i) account for the unique electromagnetic (EM) properties and (ii) incorporate the main feature of future MaMi-based communication systems, namely their capability of sensing the system’s response to the radio waves, and thereby informing its modification. Looking ahead, MaMi will have far more general applications: optical communications, radar, and wireless power transfer to name a few. The grand question that the proposed research will address is: Are the existing IT tools sufficient to understand the physical phenomena and develop the upcoming generation of MaMi-based systems in ten years from now? BEATRICE will address this fundamental question by unifying EM theory and IT and pave the way for an extended range of applications supported by massive antenna arrays after 2025.

The specific project objectives are to:

O1)	Redefine the information theoretic modelling of concurrent and future MaMi-based systems using knowledge of unique EM characteristics, thereby quantifying their realisable potential. 
O2)	Develop new topological designs and modulation techniques for robust communication by harnessing knowledge about the EM properties of the transceivers and the propagation medium.
O3)	Leverage the world-class T&M facilities at QUB, to design, fabricate and measure novel array topologies which will be able to support a plethora of MaMi-based applications.",True
"Title: STMS - Smart Tyre Management System for Safer, Greener and More Economic Transport through Innovative Technology for Smart Infrastructure from Silent Sensors Limited. Abstract: When they’re not managed properly, tyres fail. That failure costs lives, money and efficiency. Smart people in the transport business need Silent Sensors smart technology.

The Silent Sensors system manages tyres through every stage from manufacture to maintenance and monitoring for repair, reuse and recycling.  By doing so it delivers three things:

•Greater fuel efficiency – when 25% of a haulage company’s costs are fuel, small fuel savings become big. With the Silent Sensors tyre management system we estimate between 2% and 6% fuel savings.
•Increased tyre life – by managing your tyres properly, you will achieve a significantly longer life for tyres. Spread over thousands of tyres used annually in a fleet, this leads to more money retained by the business.
•Much safer tyres – 20% of road accidents are caused by tyre failures. When tyres are properly maintained by Silent Sensors systems, there are fewer failures, and much safer transport.

Silent Sensors provides an efficient, easy tyre management system at a low cost using patented RFID technology. It measures tyre pressure, tread and temperature by simply applied sensors, allowing fleet owners to better manage one of their most vital resources. It is a precise, practical and world-leading system.

The skilled, experienced team behind Silent Sensors have brought the system to a point where trials are in progress with a large fleet truck business in the UK. The Phase 1 feasibility study will create an elaborated business case that should support the development and commercialisation of this solution, initially working with our UK trial partner, then trials in Scandinavia and India and eventual expansion to the remainder of Europe and Asia, specifically China. The study will support the next steps which will require the Phase 2 funding to develop the prototype sensor product to a mass manufactured version where economies of production and scale will reduce costs to a level that will make it irresistible.",True
"Title: NANOARCHITECTRONICS - NANOARCHITECTRONICS Abstract: This FET-open Coordination and Support Action is called “Nanoarchitectronics” (NTX) to denote a new interdisciplinary research area at the crossroad of Electromagnetics and Nanoelectronics. NTX It is a new technology aimed at conceiving, designing and developing reconfigurable, adaptive and cognitive structures, sensorial surfaces and functional “skins” with unique physical properties, and engineering applications in the whole electromagnetic spectrum; through assembling building blocks at nanoscale in hierarchical architectures. The conception of this new area responds to the need of unifying concepts, methodologies and technologies in Communications, Environment Sensing Systems, Safety and Security, Bio-Sensing Systems and Imaging Nanosystems, within a wide frequency range. This FET project proposal gathers thirteen universities, research centers and high-tech industries, belonging to eight European countries.  
According to the FET work-program, the major objective of “Nanoarchitectronics” is to boost the future application-driven research through the establishment of an accepted language among physicists and engineers, a shared way of thinking, a common theoretical foundation and a common strategy for the future. Therefore, the project aims at laying the foundation for an ever-increasing synergy and progress of Nanoarchitectronics. 
To achieve these objectives, Nanoarchitectronics is structured in four main activities. The “Concept” activity is devoted to establish and define the concepts of Nanoarchitectronics and its boundaries with respect to other disciplines and to the activity carried out by other consortia. The “Strategy” activity identifies the policy dialogue and the strategic view of the consortium in terms of position, impact and vision. The “Virtual Networking” serves to internal web communication (private), and for dissemination (public). The “Dissemination and Exploitation” activity is carried out mainly by the industrial partners of the consortium",True
"Title: Tomo-FPS - Tomosynthesis is a low-dose alternate to has CT already transformed Breast Imaging, our vision is to reduce the costs, further enhance sensitivity and reduce dose, and transform portability. Abstract: The power of 3D X-ray imaging in healthcare in the form of Computed Tomography (CT) is widely accepted, but despite the widespread availability of CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) it is still the basic 2D planar X-ray that constitutes the majority (circa 60%) of medical imaging studies worldwide. Planar X-ray continues to be the “workhorse of radiology” because of its availability, low cost and small system footprint (compared to MRI and CT); its speed of image acquisition and review (compared to all other modalities); its ability to visualize tissues like bone (unlike MRI and Ultrasound); its low radiation dose (unlike CT); and its consistency and objectivity of image acquisition (unlike Ultrasound).

Tomosynthesis, a method for performing high-resolution limited-angle tomography at low dose levels, has already transformed breast cancer screening and has demonstrated an ability to near-equal CT in identifying lung nodules symptomatic of lung cancer.

Our innovation is a Flat Panel X-ray Source (FPS) that allows tomosynthesis without any moving parts. This will reduce costs and enhance acquisition speed and allows the source to be closer to the subject, reducing power needs and further reducing cost.

Unlike current tomosynthesis devices that move the source in 1 dimension, a system using an FPS could vary emission in 2 dimensions which could enhance depth resolution and the ability to localise objects. This would enhance the ability to quantify features, including biomarkers of disease progression.

Adaptix will transform planar X-ray by giving it true 3D capability, making it safer by reducing dose (versus CT, and potentially versus planar X-ray), making the systems 50% cheaper than existing market offerings and reducing weight and size by 90%. By doing this we will be improving access to the world’s most important medical diagnostic device and radically changing a $5bn global market.",False
"Title: CITYCoP - Citizen Interaction Technologies Yield Community Policing Abstract: Theories underlying community policing received new impetus with the recent advent of smartphones and social media and especially user-generated content (UGC) where citizens engage in closer interaction with their local community and law enforcement agency (LEA). The years 2010-2014 have seen a rapid upsurge of smartphone apps aimed at improving crime reporting and other forms of UGC and interaction associated with community policing. Yet these apps are characterised by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon approach with the largest number originating in the USA, a few in Canada, Australia and with the UK apparently the only major EU state where there has been some take-up of these technologies. CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining “local flavour” and diversity. These ICT solutions will also be designed from scratch to be fully compliant with strict privacy and data protection laws. A training scheme, including use of serious games, will be developed to assist training of officers and citizens in use of the app and portal.  CITYCoP will benefit from a multi-disciplinary approach that will include the sociology of community policing as well as cognitive science perspectives of the citizen’s interaction with community and LEAs through technology.  The partners in CITYCoP build on long years of successful collaboration in EU projects dealing with UGC, smart surveillance and privacy (CONSENT, SMART, RESPECT) positioning CITYCoP solutions to achieve integration into smart city eco-systems. CITYCoP will pilot deployments of multi-lingual smartphone apps, portals and serious games training packages in Bucharest (Romania), Lisbon (Portugal), Florence (Italy), Sheffield (UK).",True
"Title: 5GENESIS - 5th Generation End-to-end Network, Experimentation, System Integration, and Showcasing Abstract: In the global race towards 5G, the establishment and implementation of the 5G-PPP programme in the EU has significantly strengthened the position of Europe, promoting both technological excellence and industrial leadership. So far, 5G-PPP Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects have been proven quite successful in developing focused solutions, targeting specific technical innovations. Now, the crucial next step in the “Genesis of 5G”, in Europe but also worldwide, is to integrate all these highly diverse results and technologies in order to “glue together” the 5G picture and unveil the potential of a truly full-stack, end-to-end 5G platform, able to meet the defined KPI targets.  In this context, the main goal of 5GENESIS to validate 5G KPIs for various 5G use cases, in both controlled set-ups and large-scale events. This will be achieved by bringing together results from a considerable number of EU projects as well as the partners’ internal R&D activities in order to realise an integrated End-to-end 5G Facility, built on five diverse in terms of capabilities –yet fully interoperable- experimentation platforms distributed across Europe and interconnected with each other. The platforms will emerge as the evolution of existing testbeds, already owned and operated by the 5GENESIS partners, suitable for large-scale field experimentation. The 5GENESIS Facility, as a whole, will: - implement and verify all evolutions of the 5G standard, via an iterative integration and testing procedure; - engage a wide diversity of technologies and chain innovations that span over all domains, achieving full-stack coverage of the 5G landscape; - unify heterogeneous physical and virtual network elements under a common coordination and openness framework exposed to experimenters from the vertical industries and enabling end-to-end slicing and experiment automation; and - support further experimentation projects, in particular those focused on vertical markets.",True
"Title: MEESST - MHD Enhanced Entry System for Space Transportation Abstract: (Re-)entry into planetary atmospheres represents one of the most critical phases of space missions, involving high thermal loads on the vehicle surface and radio communication blackout which can last for minutes. As demonstrated with previous scientific studies, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) provides a framework for tackling both issues: high enough electromagnetic (EM) fields can be used to reduce heat fluxes and create a magnetic windowing able to mitigate the blackout. However, the translation of those ideas into an operational radically-new science-enabled technology to be used onboard spacecrafts has not been achieved yet. MEESST aims at filling the gap between science and technology towards the development of a first demonstrator implementing active magnetic shielding. To this end, a disruptive device consisting of a compact cryostat integrating a superconductive magnet able to generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields will be designed, manufactured, tested in on-ground experimental plasma facilities and via numerical simulations relying upon improved models. The latter will take into account, for the first time, all relevant EM-plasma interactions, thermochemical nonequilibrium and radiation effects for both Earth and Mars atmospheres. As a result, a radically-new science-enabled proof-of-concept technology will be developed and deployed, together with enhanced experimental techniques and modelling tools which can contribute to push European space technology one step ahead the competition, worldwide. The success of MEESST can introduce a paradigm shift in aerospace science and technology by turning active magnetic shielding (i.e. a futuristic concept traditionally associated to science fiction) into reality and potentially into the spotlight, not just for space travel but also for future hypersonic transportation systems, radar imaging, surveillance and GPS navigation, all requiring accurate knowledge of EM signal propagation characteristics through plasmas.",True
"Title: MAGNEURON - Hijacking cell signalling pathways with magnetic nanoactuators for remote-controlled stem cell therapies of neurodegenerative disorders Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, are a major public health issue given the aging population in
Europe and beyond. While curative pharmacological treatment of these diseases is not in sight, cell replacement therapies
(CTs) are considered very promising, in particular with the advent of stem-cell reprogramming technologies. However, a
fundamental challenge in the medical application of CTs in the brain of patients lies in the lack of control of cell behaviour at
the site of transplantation, and particularly their differentiation and oriented growth. The aim of this project is to introduce a
fundamentally new concept for remote control of cellular functions by means of magnetic manipulation. The technology is
based on magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with proteins involved in cellular signalling cascades. These
biofunctionalized MNPs (bMNPs) will be delivered into target cells, where they act as intracellular signalling platforms
activatable in a spatially and temporally controlled manner by external magnetic fields. The project will focus on engineering
these tools for the control of neuronal cell programming and fibre outgrowth by hijacking Wnt and neurotrophin signalling,
respectively, with the ulti-mate objective of advancing cell replacement therapies for PD using dopaminergic precursor
neurons.
To achieve this ambitious goal, we have gathered an interdisciplinary consortium interfacing scientists having cutting-edge
know-how in bMNP engineering, surface functionalization and cellular nanobiophysics with renowned experts in neuronal
cell differentiation, stem-cell reprogramming and regenerative (nano-)medicine. By exploiting this complementary expertise,
a novel, versatile technology for magnetic control of intracellular signalling is envis-aged, which will be a breakthrough for
remote actuation of cellular functions and its successful implementation in CTs for neurodegenerative diseases and injuries

"Title: PhySense - Physarum Sensor: Biosensor for Citizen Scientists Abstract: Imperative utilization of biosensors has acquired paramount importance in the field of drug discovery, biomedicine, food safety standards, defense, security, and environmental monitoring. This has led to the invention of precise and powerful analytical tools using biological sensing element as biosensor. PhyChip has demonstrated an effective and practical technology for using the slime mould Physarum polycephalum as a living transducer in mechanical, optical and chemical sensors. The slime mould maps a wide range of volatile chemicals, tactile stimuli and light of various wavelengths into unique combinations of frequency and amplitude of oscillations of extracellular electrical potential. Given an unknown stimulus one can infer about nature  of the stimulus from the frequency and amplitude of the electrical potential oscillations. PhySense will transform the “lab based” techniques of the slime mould hybrid sensors into `everyday’ use in a cost effective and user friendly format by designing, manufacturing and selling the bio-sensors to research centres, universities, schools and laymen enthusiasts. In addition to making the technology accessible to both the general public and non-specialists this transformative project will establish an online portal capable of collecting and sharing millions of measurements. Recent work by our group has already developed a working prototype --- based on low cost electronics and bespoke software --- which demonstrate the paradigm shift which this project offers. Citizen participation will be used to leapfrog years of traditional research catapulting Europe in the driving seat of this exciting new scientific frontier of living technologies in sensing and computing.",False
"Title: NOSY - New Operational Sensing sYstem Abstract: Organized crime investigation can greatly benefit from the availability of very small, concealable sensing devices to monitor, record and communicate criminal activity to remote surveillance stations. Acquired data can be used as proof in Courts of Justice only if the sensing device, the communication channel and the monitoring station are tamper proof and comply with all legal, integrity and chain-of-custody requirements. 
The NOSY project is focused on the development of a miniaturized yet highly sensitive platform, for the detection of illicit or suspicious substances. The platform includes the development of a miniature sensing device, a monitoring station and communication infrastructure for LEA network integration. The enabling technology of the system is an innovative microelectronics sensor that combines state of the art micro and nanotechnologies with advanced smart sensing materials, which will be integrated as part of the project. In addition there will be the development of complete devices for both stand alone and embeddable monitoring and recording. A critical requirement is that the recorded or transmitted data to be usable as proof in Court. The device will include proofing from any type of external tampering; the communication channel will be secure, compliant and integrated into the existing LEA data networks. As deemed necessary by LEAs, the project will develop prototype products to help tackle illegal drug trafficking and development of homemade bombs. Accurate and unambiguous identification of substances is fundamental to allow LEA to intervene with the most suitable action or counter measure.

"Title: BeSec - Beyond the Secular: Narrativizing religious change in contemporary German novels Abstract: The death of God and the disenchantment of the world are central to self-presentations of modernity. At the dawn of the third millennium, however, the worldwide growth of religious fundamentalisms as well as the pluralisation and individualization (but not the disappearance) of faith in the West suggest the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relation between secularity, modernity and religion. This is not only a matter for empirical research in Social, Political and Religious Studies. “Modernity,” “secularity” and “religion” are, in important ways, interpretive categories shaped by cultural narratives through which individuals and societies understand their world. The project “Beyond the Secular” studies a defined corpus of such narratives: contemporary German-language novels which articulate non-secular and religious experiences and worldviews. Through an interdisciplinary methodology combining close reading and narratological analysis with contextual readings in religious sociology, theology, and political philosophy, the project seeks to determine the potential of literature for the perception and narrativization of religious change in late modern societies.",True

"Title: HOLES - Highly Ordered Light-manipulators by Self-assembly Abstract: The application of photonics in both everyday life and advanced science would be widespread, as they have a range of advantages as compared to electronics in many applications. However, the development of high-throughput photonic technologies has proven problematic, due to the absence of easily-scalable methods to process materials of the desired optical characteristics. My project addresses that problem by adopting a highly successful approach hat has been employed in (opto)electronics, which has led to the explosion of a new prolific scientific field, new technologies, and new products: the development of solution-based processing methods. Specifically, I propose to produce a step change in the photonics field through the employment of the Dynamic Templating Process (DTP), an elegant, fully solution-processing method, which exploits the self-assembly of water microdroplets, to create micro-honeycombs, i.e. 2D photonic crystals. As solution-processable material, I propose to use an organic:inorganic hybrid, which shows refractive indexes above 2. Then, I aim to create novel 2D hierarchical and 3D photonic structures based on thy hybrid honeycombs for optical field management. In the last stage I will transform the DTP into an industrially scalable process for photonic crystal and device manufacturing. Thereby, I propose an ambitious, multidisciplinary and self-consistent project, which encompasses the synthesis of novel materials, the development of microprocessing methods, the production and characterisation of a new class of photonic elements, and the development of industrial production processes. Hence, the project is designed to generate new knowledge as well as new disruptive technology, as it may lay the foundations for next generation photonic devices",True
"Title: FORMOBILE - From mobile phones to court – A complete FORensic investigation chain targeting MOBILE devices Abstract: Mobile devices, especially smartphones represent a unique challenge for law enforcement. Criminal offenders use phones to communicate, coordinate, organise and execute criminal actions. This is especially true for organised crime and terrorist organisations. This development provides new challenges for criminal prosecution and it is vital to empower law enforcement to access the data stored on mobile devices to use it as court evidence in a trustworthy and reliable manner.  The overarching objective of FORMOBILE is to establish a complete end to end forensic investigation chain, targeting for mobile devices. To achieve this goal three objectives will be pursued. Novel tools shall be developed that include the acquisition of previously unavailable mobile data, unlocking mobile devices, as well as the decoding and analysis of mobile data. Based on the definition of requirements of law enforcement and legal and ethical issues a new mobile forensics standard shall be developed. With the developments of the new standard and the new tools, training for police and criminal prosecution will be established, providing the end users with the latest knowledge in a novel and an innovative curriculum to ensure a quality standard of investigations.   The European Union has developed as a Security Union, building on the European Agenda on Security. This aims to ensure that people live in an area of freedom, security and justice, without internal frontiers. To strengthen digital forensics in the context of criminal investigations is crucial to achieve this vision. FORMOBILE contributes to the fight against virtually all forms of crime. This is because mobile devices are widely used in crimes, especially in the arrangement of conspiracies. Yet, there are crimes more closely related to mobile devices; this includes child abuse and emerging forms of cybercrime in particular. To fight crime effectively, law enforcement has to be empowered to access all evidence stored on mobile devices.",True

"Title: LIVERHOPE - SIMVASTATIN AND RIFAXIMIN AS NEW THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS Abstract: Liver cirrhosis is a very common chronic disease and one of the leading causes of death in European. Moreover, cirrhosis has a marked impact in patients quality of life and represents a major burden for health systems. Treatment of cirrhosis is currently based on symptomatic management of complications and has not changed substantially in the last 20 years. There is an unmet need for therapies that target the pathobiology of cirrhosis.
The objective of LIVERHOPE project is to evaluate a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with cirrhosis based on a combination of rifaximin and simvastatin, targeting the main pathophysiological mechanisms of disease progression , namely the impairment in the gut-liver axis and the persistent hepatic and systemic inflammatory response. This dual therapeutic approach is supported by preclinical data showing excellent and very promising results.
We will perform two randomized double-blind trials to investigate safety, tolerability and efficacy of combination of simvastatin plus rifaximin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis in 5 EU countries (285 patients will be enrolled in two trials in DE, ES, FR, IT, UK). The expected impact is to halt progression to acute-on-chronic liver failure, the main cause of death, to decrease complications of the disease, to reduce hospital readmissions, to improve cost-effectiveness of therapy. Our final aim is to improve patients quality-of-life and increase survival as patients‘ care is the core of LIVERHOPE. Within the project we will also investigate biomarkers of response to treatment and disease progression that can be useful in clinical practice for improving the treatment of patients. We will invest our effort also in communication and dissemination activities for increasing awareness about chronic liver diseases in European countries so that preventive measures can be established to decrease the burden of cirrhosis and reduce social stigmatization of patients with chronic liver diseases.",False
"Title: VICINITY - Open virtual neighbourhood network to connect intelligent buildings and smart objects Abstract: The lack of interoperability is considered as the most important barrier to achieve the global integration of IoT ecosystems across borders of different disciplines, vendors and standards. Indeed, the current IoT landscape consists of a large set of isolated islands that do not constitute a real internet, preventing the exploitation of the huge potential expected by ICT visionaries.

To overcome this situation, VICINITY presents a virtual neighborhood concept, which is a decentralized, bottom-up and cross-domain approach that resembles a social network, where users can configure their set ups, integrate standards according to the services they want to use and fully control their desired level of privacy. VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services.

VICINITY's approach will be demonstrated by a large-scale demonstration connecting 8 facilities in 7 different countries. The demonstration covers various domains including energy, building automation, health and transport. VICINITY's potential to create new, domain-crossing services will be demonstrated by value added services such as micro-trading of DSM capabilities, AI-driven optimization of smart urban districts and business intelligence over IoT.

Open calls are envisioned in the project to integrate further, preferably public, IoT infrastructures and to deploy additional added value services. This will not only extend the scale of VICINITY demonstration, but also efficiently raise the awareness of industrial communities of VICINITY and its capabilities.",True
"Title: my-AHA - My Active and Healthy Aging Abstract: Background
We propose a holistic view of interrelated frailties: cognitive decline, physical frailty, depression and anxiety, social isolation and poor sleep quality, which are a major burden to older adults and social and health care systems. Early detection and intervention are crucial in sustaining active and healthy ageing (AHA) and slowing or reversing further decline.

Aims and Relevance
The main aim of my-AHA is to reduce frailty risk by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, resulting in healthcare cost savings. my-AHA will use state-of-the-art analytical concepts to provide new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support.

Approach
An ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via non-stigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected, my-AHA will provide targeted ICT-based interventions with a scientific evidence base of efficacy, including vetted offerings from established providers of medical and AHA support. These interventions will follow an integrated approach to motivate users to participate in exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with my-AHA.

Scale and Sustainability
The proposed platform provides numerous incentives to engage diverse stakeholders, constituting a sustainable ecosystem with empowered end users and reliable standardised interfaces for solutions providers, which will be ready for larger scale deployment at project end. The ultimate aim is to deliver significant innovation in the area of AHA by cooperation with European health care organizations, SMEs, NGOs.",False

Energy vertical represents undoubtedly one of the most significant “test cases” for 5G enabling technologies, due to the need of addressing a huge range of very diverse requirements to deal with across a variety of applications (stringent capacity for smart metering/AMI versus latency for supervisory control and fault localization).However, to effectively support energy utilities along their transition towards more decentralized renewable-oriented systems,  several open issues still remain as to 5G networks management automation, security, resilience, scalability and portability.  To face these issues, NRG-5 will research and develop a novel  5G PPP-compliant software framework specifically tailored to the energy domain, which combines i) trusted, scalable and lock-in free plug ‘n’ play support for a  variety  of  constrained devices;  ii) 5G devices’ abstractions to demonstrate mMTC, uMTC and xMBB communications coupled with partially distributed, trusted, end-to-end security and MCM to enable secure, scalable and energy efficient communications; iii) extended Mobile Edge Computing (xMEC) micro-clouds to reduce backhaul load, increase the overall network capacity and reduce delays, while facilitating the deployment of generic MTC-related NFVs and utility-centric VNFs; iv) an extended 5G ETSI-MANO predictive analytics framework to support automated, dynamic, elastic VNF reconfiguration.  Extensive lab based validation will be complemented with real life demonstrations in two pilot sites (Italy, France) where proof-of-concept implementations for 5G-enabled electricity and gas distribution network optimized management will be offered, while offering support to 5G PPP phase III projects via demonstrating high replication potential towards other verticals.",True

While many efforts have focused on better access to healthcare and the expansion of assisted and social care housing, one of the main intervention points, enabling the aging population to remain in their homes longer, is just now becoming a primary developmental priority.  Caring for the aging population as they transition from active and independent lifestyles to those requiring significant external support is a large and complex field, with many approaches to the great diversity of citizen need profiles. Within the SAAM project (Supporting Active Aging through Multimodal coaching) we focus upon innovative, technology-enabled approaches to support the aging population living at home, with a novel and practical emphasis on ambient sensing and learning of user needs and preferences, and effective coaching by leveraging the user’s social support networks.  Over three years, the project’s partners will develop and test new methods allowing Europe’s aging population to remain active, independent and longer in their homes.",True
"Title: PSR94 - Commercialisation of 94GHz Phase Shifting Radar (PSR94) Abstract: This proposal presents a unique opportunity to commercialise ground-breaking radar technology, a 94GHz Phase Shifting Radar (PSR94). We will bring the PSR94 from the current TRL 6 (technology demonstrated in relevant environment) to TRL 8 (system complete and qualified), ready for TRL 9 (customer use in an operational environment).
This project will overcome the industrial problems, in the AeroSpace sector, associated with scanning beams at high frequency, namely the large physical size of the radar, the large power requirements and also reduced reliability due to the many moving parts. The PSR94 takes an extremely complex difficult method of antenna scanning and replaces it with a small light radar. 
The key advantages of our solution are:
• 94 GHz offers unparalleled radar resolution 
• Only electronically scanning antenna (with no moving parts, solid state) at 94GHz in the world
• Very small and compact (only 20cm diameter)
• Very wide scanning angles (up to 60 degrees)
• Can scan in both elevation and azimuth
• Can also track (monopulse) no need for two radar systems
• Less expensive to manufacture
• Very low power consumption
• Easy to control using near DC voltages 
The wider security radar market is estimated to be valued at $11.6 billion in 2014 (SDI, 2014). Our Target Addressable
Market (millimetre wave radar) is growing at a CAGR of 45% and is expected to reach $2 Billion by 2020 (Markets &

"Title: SaT5G - Satellite and Terrestrial Network for 5G Abstract: The introduction and global roll out of eMBB service within 5G raises coverage and network dimensioning issues in underserved and unserved areas, especially in low ARPU regions of emerging markets, and on mobile platforms (e.g. vessels and aircraft). Satcom systems are the only economic solution to address these scenarios provided that they are seamlessly integrated into the future 5G architecture and optimum efficiency is achieved via technological synergies between 5G mobile and satcom systems.

SaT5G will bring satcom into 5G by defining optimal satellite-based backhaul and traffic offloading solutions. It will research, develop and validate key 5G technologies in order to take the best value of satcom capabilities (e.g. multicast for content and VNF delivery, ubiquity and resiliency) and mitigate its inherent constraints (e.g. latency). It will identify novel business models and economically viable operational collaborations that integrate the satellite and terrestrial stakeholders in a win-win situation. SaT5G will validate, through specific research pillars, the required technology bricks that will enable the targeted markets to be addressed.

"Title: MuSeq - Defining the Oligodendrocyte Lineage in Multiple Sclerosis Lesions by Single Cell RNA-Sequencing Abstract: At which stage in oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation does remyelination in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions fail? Answering this is essential for developing new therapies for progressive MS patients in whom failed remyelination leads to neurodegeneration. Current neuropathological technologies using antibody labelling are insufficiently sensitive to detect each of the possible stages at which the process might fail. In MuSeq, I will therefore use single cell and single nuclear RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) technologies to define the stages of OL differentiation in human post-mortem brain in healthy and in MS tissue available to me from the Edinburgh tissue bank. By overcoming the problems of sensitivity and revealing the degree of heterogeneity within lesions, this innovative and multidisciplinary project will for the first time unravel the patterns of OL differentiation and its failure in human MS lesions. This in turn will generate a new and powerful classification system for MS lesions based on their regenerative potential, and generate an open-access web database for future functional studies beyond this project and laboratory. By identifying those key roadblocks that need to be overcome to promote remyelination, MuSeq will lay the foundations for rational therapeutics to improve the repair mechanisms of individual MS patients and thus promote European scientific excellence. The project will be carried out under the guidance of leading experts at the University of Edinburgh with a secondment at the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm), a world-leading medical research institution. Results from the project will be used to raise public awareness on the importance of innovative MS research.

"Title: SINHOPSI - Single-Hole Pumping in Silicon Abstract: A globally consistent system of measurement units and reference standards is a necessary underpinning feature of most technological, industrial and economic activities. In fact, to perform measurements of physical quantities, record and compare them in a consistent way, systems of units and standards have been historically developed and agreed upon. However, in the last few decades, the ever-increasing need for stability and reliability has determined a shift from standards based on material artefacts or prototypes towards those based on physical phenomena and true constants of nature. The focus of this proposal is the development of a novel quantum technology to generate highly accurate electric currents directly linked to the elementary charge. This could serve as the practical implementation for a quantum-based standard for the SI unit ampere, which is a long-standing goal in electrical metrology. Semiconductor nano-scale charge pumps have been used in the last three decades to generate accurate electric currents by clocking the transport of single electrons with driving oscillators. The main limitation to the fidelity of the charge transfer is ultimately ascribable to the poor spatial confinement of electrons that produces errors during the pumping cycle. In this project silicon-based nanotechnology will be employed to realize and operate the world-first charge pump based on the transfer of single holes rather than electrons. A hole carries the positive equivalent of an elementary charge, but its effective mass can be significantly larger than the electron's. The resulting tightly confined charge carrier wavefunction is expected to provide significant benefits in suppressing pumping errors. The primary objectives will be to develop the underpinning technology to fabricate and operate the first single-hole pump, and experimentally assess its performances in comparison to the well-established electron-based technology.",True
"Title: PROMIS - Postgraduate Research on Dilute Metamorphic Nanostructures and Metamaterials in Semiconductor Photonics Abstract: Photonics, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing technologies have been identified as key enabling technologies (KETs) for the EU. Today the photonics global market alone is around €300 billion and Europe has established a strong position with a total share of 20%, directly employing about 290,000 people. However, the shortage of sufficient skilled labour and entrepreneurs capable of handling the highly multi-disciplinary nature of KETs remains a major problem in the EU. Tailoring of semiconductors at the nanoscale is an important enabling technology for a wide range of photonics and electronics applications in diverse areas. In the training network proposed here, a cohort of 15 early stage researchers will be trained in the full range of skills required for a career in photonics, including materials growth, device fabrication, characterisation, design, theory, and commercialisation. A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 8 academic partners, 2 full industry partners and 7 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be developed within four burgeoning research areas; Semiconductor Metamaterials & Plasmonics, Dilute Nitride semiconductor nanostructures, Hydrogenated Semiconductors and Metamorphic structures. The outcomes of this enabling fundamental research are well focused to deliver advances in sources for secure communications, sensitive detectors for security applications, more efficient solar cells for energy generation, LEDs and sensors for environmental gas and bio-sensing.

"Title: BRISRES - The Basal Roughness of Ice Sheets from Radio-Echo Sounding Abstract: The subglacial environment beneath the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the physically least well characterised environments on Earth. Ice sheet model simulations demonstrate high sensitivity to their basal sliding parameterisation which is governed by basal roughness, the thermal state of the bed, and lithology (presence or absence or deformable sediments). Compiling observations of the current state of the glacier bed is therefore crucial for the accuracy of ice sheet modelling and future predictions of sea level change. Radio-echo sounding (RES) is the only existing geophysical technique that has sufficient data coverage to enable ice-sheet-wide information to be obtained from the bed. In general, however, quantitative analysis of radar sounding data, and integration with electromagnetic and geostatistical approaches, lags significantly behind the data availability.
         In this fellowship I will develop an integrated framework for characterising the roughness of glacier beds; exploiting information from the electromagnetic scattering of the radar pulse and the statistics of the basal topography. This approach will enable an unprecedented characterisation of the scale dependence of basal roughness from the kilometre to the metre scale - the scale that is most relevant for basal sliding.  Via a synthesis with ice sheet models I will challenge assumptions that are made regarding basal roughness and its relationship with other geophysical data fields, enabling new radar-derived constraints to be placed upon the bed of ice sheets. Subsidiary goals include: adapting electromagnetic scattering models for fractal surfaces to ice penetrating radar; identifying and mapping regions of deformable bed; and developing a framework for combining electromagnetic scattering information from different radar systems. This fellowship represents a unique opportunity to transfer knowledge and techniques from the US geophysical radar community to European glaciology.",True
"Title: PhyMeBa - The Physical  Mechanics of Swimming Bacteria Abstract: Bacteria play a critical role in the life of higher organisms. Their behavior is constrained by the physical properties of their habitat: first and foremost, the presence of a surrounding fluid. Most bacteria are motile, and most motile bacteria swim in fluids using slender helical appendages called flagella rotated by specialized motors. While many bacteria have only one flagellum, most well-studied pathogenic bacteria possess multiple flagella. Why have some bacteria evolved to use many flagella when others survive with one? In order to answer this question, one needs to understand quantitatively how multiple flagella provide a fitness advantage to a cell exploring its environment. The principal difficulty in deriving rigorous models for swimming bacteria lies in the {nonlinear} nature of the underlying external physics, which involves nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between flagella, short-range steric and electrostatic interactions, and elastic deformations of the flagella, which not only bend and twist but also undergo conformational changes. In this project, we will develop novel experimentally-testable theoretical modeling of the configurations and regimes relevant to swimming bacteria with multiple flagella with a focus on the mechanical forces at play. As a fundamental departure with past work, we will seek to exploit the slenderness and relative proximity of the flagella to incorporate all nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between flagella analytically and to simplify the determination of elastic stresses. This will allow us, in turn, to determine precisely the distribution of flagellar forces and derive a predictive framework for the stochastic behavior of swimming cells. The project will provide first-principle understanding of the external forces at play in one of the most important processes in biology and will help answer a number of outstanding physical questions on the behavior of swimming bacteria and the interactions with their environment.",False
"Title: BD4QoL - Big Data Models and Intelligent tools for Quality of Life monitoring and participatory empowerment of head and neck cancer survivors Abstract: Head and neck cancer can take away a patient’s “right to feel human,” and its impact on physical appearance, physical functioning, psychological status and general quality of life (QoL) can be devastating. Over the past several decades, the number of patients who survive head and neck cancer (HNC) has increased; this makes lifelong surveillance critical. HNC imposes an extremely high socioeconomic burden on patients during and after cancer compared to other tumors, including costs from treatment-induced morbidities, loss of workforce participation and short-term disability. Current survivorship care plans mostly focus on functional and health conditions of treated patients, whereas socioeconomic determinants of quality of life are often neglected due to difficult data collection.

"Title: MicroQC - Microwave driven ion trap quantum computing Abstract: The construction of a large-scale trapped-ion quantum information processor can be made decisively simpler by using the well-developed and compact microwave technology present already in today’s mobile phones and other devices. Microwave technology has tremendous simplification potential by condensing experimental effort from an optical table with several square meters of accurately aligned optical components down to an engineered conductor microstructure embedded into a chip surface and a few off-the-shelve microwave components. Thus, this technology can be the key enabling step for addressing the formidable challenge of a scalable quantum processor. Although the field is still in its infancy, there is rapid progress: a fidelity of over 99.9999% has been achieved for single-qubit gates and 99.7% for two-qubit gates. This technology allows execution of quantum gates by the application of a voltage to a microchip potentially replacing millions of laser beams and it can operate at room temperature or mild cooling. There are still enormous technical challenges in scaling ion trap (or any other) systems up to the millions of qubits required to implement meaningful full-sale quantum computation and simulation.

The technical approach exploits the benefits of the centralisation of Small Cell functions as scale grows through an edge cloud environment based on a two-tier architecture: a first distributed tier for providing low latency services and a second centralised tier for providing high processing power for computing-intensive network applications. This  allows decoupling the control and user planes of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and achieving the benefits of Cloud-RAN without the enormous fronthaul latency restrictions. The use of end-to-end network slicing mechanisms will allow sharing the 5G ESSENCE infrastructure among multiple operators/vertical industries and customising its capabilities on a per-tenant basis.

Abstract: This European Training Network aims to produce the next generation of early stage researchers who will enable Europe to take a leading role in the development of future devices, systems and networks supporting the 5G high-speed wireless internet. To do this, researchers must be able to work in interdisciplinary teams, integrate their activities, share expertise, and promote a vision of a converged wireless and optical devices and networks that efficiently supports the services and applications being demanded. A large number of technologies and devices will need to converge, co-exist and interoperate, and most importantly, cooperate, if this vision is to be efficiently and cost-effectively realised.

"Title: MARTE - Medically Assisted Reproduction: The Effects on Children, Adults and Families Abstract: Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) is one of the most important achievements of medical science in the last generation. In advanced societies, the number of MAR treatments increases every year, and, over the last four decades, more than five million MAR conceived children were born, and many more families received treatment. Given this trend, it is a public health prerogative to find out whether MAR affects the well-being of families. Prior findings are mixed and often hampered by low statistical power or conceptual limitations. I propose a programme of research that goes beyond the state-of-the-art by being the first to analyze comprehensively the effects of MAR on children, adults, and families through a combination of uniquely rich data, previously unused research designs, and conceptual innovations. First, in contrast to past work using small or convenience samples, I use extremely detailed and large datasets from population registers and surveys. Second, I compare the impact of MAR on different domains of life by analysing its effects on a range of adult and child outcomes (e.g., physical/mental health, education, union stability), thereby allowing me to investigate trade-offs that have not been previously tested. Third, I use innovative research designs to test whether the impact of MAR is causal by comparing children conceived through MAR treatments to their spontaneously conceived siblings, and adults who successfully conceive through MAR to those who are unsuccessful. The project has the potential to produce ground-breaking results that will impact future research in this field. Moreover, the project will have important policy implications, as its findings will be immediately relevant to health professionals advising couples seeking MAR treatments, to public health authorities allocating resources to mitigate the potentially negative effects of MAR on health, and to policy-makers considering whether to (further) subsidize MAR treatments.",False
"Title: NCLas - NanoCrystals in Fibre Lasers Abstract: The NCLas project will introduce and develop a disruptive technology for the synthesis of glasses containing functional nanocrystals (NCs). It is based on a novel hybrid nanosintering process, which allows for the incorporation of a large variety of NCs and functionalization of glasses in different formats for various applications. Previous attempts to either grow NCs inside glass by a glass heat treatment or incorporate NCs during glass formation showed unconvincing results. In our nanosintering process, key enabling steps include reducing the sintering temperature, developing specialized NC core-shell structures and adjusting the glass composition, thus achieving a chemically inert environment and matching the refractive index of NCs and glass. This technology will be exploited to produce low-loss, NC-functionalized glass fibres. Fibre lasers are energy efficient and compact and offer maintenance-free operation, ultra-short pulses, high power, and low noise. Today’s commercial fibre lasers are fabricated from robust, durable silica glass. The operation of oxide fibre lasers can be extended to an enormous spectral range (~400–3000 nm) by doping oxide glasses with laser-active nanocrystals optimized for particular laser wavelengths, thus enabling a huge variety of new applications. We will demonstrate two highly relevant fibre lasers: (i) a Ti3+:sapphire-NC fibre laser tuneable around 800 nm for bio-photonic applications; (ii) a Pr3+:yttria-NC 1300-nm fibre laser enabling a much-awaited wavelength extension in telecommunications and also fitting into one of the biophotonic windows. The high risk of NCLas is mitigated by an interdisciplinary team with demonstrated experience in their fields and highly complementary backgrounds. We will address the project challenges in all its steps, from material synthesis to device demonstration. NCLas makes a significant contribution to Key Enabling Technologies such as Nanotechnology, Photonics and Advanced Materials.",True

The goal of this project is to further uncover such hidden structures, by exploiting a surprising interplay of fundamental principles. One focus will be on recently discovered infrared and ultraviolet principles, their possible duality, and how they can be used to construct scattering amplitudes in new ways that expose unitarity as an emergent property. Next, the project will explore the expression of unitarity as a geometry of positive constraints, which was conjectured to fully define string theory amplitudes. The final main goal is the application of such on-shell principles and the color-kinematic duality to form factors, off-shell generalisations of scattering amplitudes of great phenomenological importance. The project also encompasses a comprehensive program for the dissemination and communication of its results. The former will be based on publications in high impact journals and talks at major conferences, while the latter involves diverse outreach activities targeted at a wide range of audiences. The researcher will benefit from a bespoke training program, including courses in career management, public engagement, teaching activities, and participation in scientific workshops. The balanced distribution of these complementary activities is designed to optimise the benefit for the researcher, to increase his visibility and independence, to enhance his skills portfolio and, hence, to prepare him for a permanent academic position in the future.",False
"Title: ECOPOTENTIAL - ECOPOTENTIAL: IMPROVING FUTURE ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS THROUGH EARTH OBSERVATIONS Abstract: Terrestrial and marine ecosystems provide essential services to human societies. Anthropogenic pressures, however, cause serious threat to ecosystems, leading to habitat degradation, increased risk of collapse and loss of ecosystem services. Knowledge-based conservation, management and restoration policies are needed to improve ecosystem benefits in face of increasing pressures. ECOPOTENTIAL makes significant progress beyond the state-of-the-art and creates a unified framework for ecosystem studies and management of protected areas (PA). ECOPOTENTIAL focuses on internationally recognized PAs in Europe and beyond in a wide range of biogeographic regions, and it includes UNESCO, Natura2000 and LTER sites and Large Marine Ecosystems. Best use of Earth Observation (EO) and monitoring data is enabled by new EO open-access ecosystem data services (ECOPERNICUS). Modelling approaches including information from EO data are devised, ecosystem services in current and future conditions are assessed and the requirements of future protected areas are defined. Conceptual approaches based on Essential Variables, Macrosystem Ecology and cross-scale interactions allow for a deeper understanding of the Earth's Critical Zone. Open and interoperable access to data and knowledge is assured by a GEO Ecosystem Virtual Laboratory Platform, fully integrated in GEOSS. Support to transparent and knowledge-based conservation and management policies, able to include information from EO data, is developed. Knowledge gained in the PAs is upscaled to pan-European conditions and used for planning and management of future PAs. A permanent stakeholder consultancy group (GEO Ecosystem Community of Practice) will be created. Capacity building is pursued at all levels. SMEs are involved to create expertise leading to new job opportunities, ensuring long-term continuation of services.

"Title: SINTBAT - Silicon based materials and new processing technologies for improved lithium-ion batteries Abstract: According to the European Energy Storage Technology Development Roadmap towards 2030 (EASE/EERA) energy storage will be of the greatest importance for the European climate energy objectives. The Sintbat project aims at the development of a cheap energy efficient and effectively maintenance free lithium-ion based energy storage system offering in-service time of 20 to 25 years. Insights gained from advanced in-situ and in-operando analysis methods will be used for multi scale modelling targeting on the simulation of aging mechanisms for a reliable lifetime prediction and enhancement. In addition, the latest generation of anode materials based on silicon as well as a prelithiation process for lifetime enhancement will be implemented in the cell manufacturing process. The implementation of high energy materials combined with a low cost and environmental benign aqueous cathode manufacturing process will lead to remarkable cell costs reduction down to 130 € per kWh. This will enable battery based storage system for an economic reasonable price of less than 400 € per kWh (CAPEX) and will lower the OPEX down to less than 0.09 € per stored kWh for the targeted in-service time of 20 to 25 years (10,000 cycles). The technical developments will be supported by the set-up of a relevant roadmap as well as a catalogue for good practice. To guarantee the highest possible impact for the European economy the Sinbat consortium installed an Industrial Advisory Board including various European battery material suppliers, cell manufacturer and end-users whereby the whole value added chain in this way is completed within the Sintbat project. This strong interaction of the Sintbat consortium with relevant stakeholders in the European energy economy will assure that battery based energy storage systems are becoming an economic self-sustaining technology.",False
"Title: GATE - Glass Assessment Technology for glass Embedded antennas Abstract: The advanced applications in 5G, such as Internet of Things, smart building, and smart city, are driving the growth of indoor broadband communications. Small cell is a promising technology to address capacity crunch problem in-building. Glass is a popular material widely used in modern buildings. Considering the factors of aesthetics and stability, embedding antennas into glass can be a good choice for deploying small cells indoors. However, how the glass impacts the wireless performance of a glass embedded antenna has not been well investigated. In this project, we will study the influence of EM properties of glass on the wireless performance and will design and optimise glass to achieve desirable wireless performance while maintaining acceptable optical and thermal properties. First, we will define measurable wireless performance metrics for glass embedded antennas, where the radiation efficiency, bandwidth, radiation pattern, coverage, and signal to interference plus noise ratio will be taken into account. Then, we will bridge the gap between ingredient ratios and structures of glass and the wireless performance of the embedded antenna. Three glass structures including coated glass, laminated glass and doping glass will be modeled. Finally, we will develop a method that can obtain a trade-off among wireless, optical and thermal performances of glasses. The ingredient ratio and structure of glass will be optimised in term of wireless performance under the constraints of optical and thermal performances, so that the glass can be multifunctional and smart. After this project, the benefits and feasibility of glass embedded antenna arrays can be assessed and the key technology of optimising glass embedded antennas can be established.",True
"Title: NextGenProteins - BIOCONVERSION OF UNDERUTILIZED RESOURCES INTO NEXT GENERATION PROTEINS FOR FOOD AND FEED Abstract: Demand for proteins is increasing for food and feed applications. To meet the increasing demand, production will have to double by 2050. However, current protein production, both animal- and vegetal based, has severe negative environmental impacts in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land and water use, as well as biodiversity loss. The EU is not self-sufficient when it comes to protein production and a large proportion of the demand is met with imported proteins with concerns regarding food security and the general competitiveness of the EU. It is therefore of vital importance to find sustainable alternative protein sources that can be economically produced in quantities that meet growing food and feed sectors. NextGenProteins has identified microalgae, single cell protein and insects as three promising sources of alternative proteins that can be produced through innovative and environmentally sustainable bioconversion processes using industrial waste streams. These processes cause limited environmental impacts and pressure on natural resources. Through collaboration between industry and RTD, the project will address key barriers that currently prohibit or limit the application of the three alternative proteins in food and feed, such as production scalability and optimisation, production costs, value chain risks, safety, regulations and consumer trust and acceptance. The project will demonstrate the suitability and economic viability of the alternative proteins in food and feed value chains and explore their market opportunities with the industry, stakeholders, policy makers and consumers. NextGenProteins will find means to improve the acceptability and trust of consumers towards alternative proteins and processes. The project will contribute to strengthening food security, sustainability and self-sufficiency of EU protein production with future-proof supply, as well as long-term reduction of land use, water use, GHG emissions and energy of EU food sector.",False
"Title: Eco-UV - Low carbon footprint and eco-innovative UV water disinfection Abstract: The central objective for Eco-UV is the demonstration and characterisation of an innovative UV lamp and driving electronics technology for chemical-free water treatment and disinfection. The newly implemented technology is a ground-breaking innovation providing up to four times increased lifetime with greatly increased efficiency, the energy consumption reduced by 80%. Thus, this technology provides a lower carbon footprint, much improved energy use and hence greatly reduced lifetime costs. Additionally, the innovative technology will be introduced with a mercury-free configuration, removing the need to handle with this hazardous substance in manufacture and disposal, hence providing a sustainable and eco-innovative technology. The project will prove the lamp technology by demonstration in real applications with full characterisation in terms of long-term stability, ageing effects and dose-response-relationship. Furthermore, the UV lamps are integrated in reactors and the performance of the whole UV system is evaluated at a test centre for drinking water. A new testing protocol for different end-users applications will furthermore be derived, which will be the basis for a future standardised validation of industrial UV applications. The technology will be installed at three demonstration sites for an extended running period. At each, the treatment performance of the UV systems will be evaluated according to the inactivation of micro organisms and the reduction of application specific chemicals, e. g. antibiotics and pesticides. A full Life Cycle evaluation of cost and environmental benefits will be disseminated via EU ETV forums to ensure active uptake of the technology offering by comparing it to traditional UV technology in terms of energy, infrastructure and lifetime costs. The proposed UV technology is addressing the thematic priority areas as outlined in the EIP on Water, especially water reuse, water treatment, water governance and the water-energy nexus.",False
"Title: 5GEx - 5G Exchange Abstract: The goal of the 5G Exchange (5GEx) project is to enable cross-domain orchestration of services over multiple administrations or over multi-domain single administrations. This will allow end-to-end network and service elements to mix in multi-vendor, heterogeneous technology and resource environments. Market fragmentation has resulted in a multitude of network operators each focused on different countries and regions. This makes it difficult to create infrastructure services spanning multiple countries, such as virtual connectivity or compute resources, as no single operator has a footprint everywhere.

5GEx aims to enable collaboration between operators, regarding 5G infrastructure services, with the view to introducing a unification via NFV/SDN compatible multi-domain orchestration by producing (i) an open platform enabling cross-domain orchestration of services over these multiple domains, with a set of open source software tools and extensions that can be utilised outside the scope of 5GEx; (ii) a Sandbox Network enabling experimentation and validation of the devised architecture, mechanisms, and business models; (iii) a proof-of-innovation multi-domain platform enabling multiple 5G use-cases and realistic scenarios that demonstrate the orchestration of complex end-to-end Infrastructure as a Service across multiple carriers; (iv) contributions to standards bodies of concepts learned during the development and experimentation of the project; (v) input to stimulate the telecom and IT industry stakeholders by actively promoting adoption of 5GEx’s open solutions.

Such 5G infrastructure services will provide a crucial role in making 5G happen as they provide the foundation of all cloud and networking services. 5GEx aims to enable, through operator collaboration, a unified European infrastructure service market integrating multiple operators and technologies, where service provisioning is fast and automated and which results in stronger economy via economies of scale.",True
"Title: Comedy and Politics - The Comedy of Political Philosophy.  Democratic Citizenship, Political Judgment, and Ideals in Political Practice. Abstract: Despite the rich history and contemporary relevance of the intersection of comedy, political practices, and political thought, comedy has thus far not received sustained attention in the field of political philosophy. This research programme will address this lacuna by developing parallels between (i) the specific outlook on human action offered by comedies and (ii) the perspective of a tradition of political thought known as political realism.

The overall objective of this research programme is to demonstrate that comedy reflects the theoretical and methodological commitments of political realism, and to establish comedy’s contribution to realism by drawing out realism’s transformative potential. 

Three specific research objectives will be combined to support the overall objective. (a) The first objective will develop an account of democratic citizenship informed by comedy by exploring Aristophanes’ comedies. (b) The second objective will develop an account of political judgment informed by comedy, by analysing Machiavelli’s comedies and political writings in relation to each other. (c) The third objective will develop an account of the relation between ideals and practice in politics informed by comedy by drawing on theoretical reflections on comedy by Hegel, Vischer, and Marx. 

Each of the specific research objectives corresponds to a central feature of political realism. By developing these objectives through comedy, the researcher will explicate structural parallels between comedy and political realism. In each of the specific objectives, the transformative potential inherent in comedy will be elucidated. In doing so, the researcher will use insights derived from this parallel to develop a more nuanced understanding of political realism’s potential to conceptualize social transformation. Thus comedy transpires as the means through which the full potential of realism for political philosophy as a whole can be grasped for the first time.",True
"Title: DarkSphere - Search for light Dark Matter with a Spherical Proportional Counter Abstract: The aim of DarkSphere is to shine a light on the nature of Dark Matter (DM), with the NEWS-G direct detection experiment that focuses in the low mass region. Through the novel detector concept of Spherical Proportional Counters, the experiment will provide for the first time access to the 0.1 - 10 GeV mass region, which is highly motivated by the Higgs boson discovery and the non-observation of supersymmetry at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The innovative detector concept offers a number of advantages, including: very low energy detection threshold, background rejection capabilities, and construction of large volume using solely radiopure materials. Furthermore, in contrast to other direct detection experiments, using a choice of light target gases, including hydrogen, helium, and neon, allows the NEWS-G experiment to kinematically match the target to the DM candidate mass, and thus maximise its sensitivity for each mass in the region of interest. Within the project a number of advances will be achieved in terms of detector optimisation and simulation through original measurements, background measurement methods, physics analysis with novel classification and statistical inference methods, and advances in DM phenomenology. Beyond use in fundamental physics research, the detector concepts relevant for DarkSphere have potential for industrial and medical applications, which are also explored.",False
"Title: REDSTEM - Development of a new plant variety for the Asian market Abstract: Palms are some of the most successfully traded plants, with numerous species sold for indoor, outdoors and as crops. The kentia palm (Howea forsteriana), is one of the most widely exported houseplants in the world and is worth over seven million euros per year in the Dutch horticultural industry alone. Wild kentias are only found on a 12km2 island in the middle of the Tasman Sea, Lord Howe Island (LHI). LHI is a unique ecosystem. It is the focus of the applicant's ERC Advanced Grant, who is using the kentia palms as a model to tackle 'Darwin's mystery of mysteries'. During our expeditions on LHI, we have also discovered a new mutant variety of the kentia palm: instead of having the typical dark green colouration, it has a bright red stem.  Red-stemmed varieties of palms are known, but have had very limited commercialisation due to climatic restrictions: these palms are tropical species, requiring high humidity and temperature. In contrasts, kentias are very hardy and grow well under low light and cool temperatures, hence their immense success as decorative items across innumerable indoor public venues and households. In addition, red is an auspicious colour in Asia – and we know our new red kentia palm has tremendous horticulture potential. Building on our genetic research and experiments with these kentia palms, we propose to disentangle the biological underpinning of the red stem. In parallel, we will conduct a market research. Examining our IPR position and strategy, we will take the necessary steps to protect our variety, including its registration as Ornamental  Crop  to the Community  Plant Variety  Office.  Finally,  we will strengthen  our links  with  various industries and private stakeholders to develop a business plan for commercialisation of red kentias",False

"Title: CULTIVATE MSS - Cultural Values and the International Trade in Medieval European Manuscripts, c. 1900-1945 Abstract: CULTIVATE MSS aims to assess the significance of the trade in medieval manuscripts for the development of ideas about the nature and value of European culture in the early 20th century, a crucial period for the development of modern European nation states. Although recent technological developments have facilitated quantitative analyses of provenance data, charting in increasing detail the early-20th-century movement of manuscripts, including an exodus of works to America, qualitative analyses have failed to keep pace, leaving questions of how and why particular books were valued underexplored. The PI’s role in the development of the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts, which has begun to make available historic data about books, has revealed the need for a reassessment of the relationship between collecting and scholarship, and the potential for existing data about the manuscript trade to be used, with unpublished archival sources, to identify and compare the economic and philosophical values projected onto books. Thus the project uses the PI’s expertise to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to assess the roles of collectors, scholars and dealers in the formation of collections of medieval manuscripts, and the impact of this on scholarship, comparing the English-speaking world, France and Germany. It will analyse published and unpublished accounts of manuscripts, together with price data, to reconstruct values projected onto books. It will seek to contextualise these values within the history of the early 20th century, assessing the impact of two world wars and other political and economic shifts on the trade in books and attitudes to manuscripts as objects of national significance. The Middle Ages are often identified with the emergence of European cultural identities, thus a reappraisal of the historiography of the study of medieval manuscripts has the potential to impact research about attitudes to European culture and identity in a wide range of disciplines.",False
"Title: OpenAIS - Open Architectures for Intelligent Solid State Lighting Systems Abstract: Following the trends of the creation of the “The Internet of Things” (IoT) and the rapid penetration of SSL based lighting, it is
very advantageous to connect the luminaires in buildings to the Internet.
OpenAIS aims at setting the leading standard for inclusion of lighting for professional applications in to IoT, with a focus on
office lighting. This will enable a transition from the currently existing closed and command oriented lighting control systems
to an open and service oriented system architecture. Openness and service orientation will create an eco-system of
suppliers of interoperable components and a market for apps that exploit the lighting system to add value beyond the lighting
function. Added value can e.g. be related to more efficient use of the building, reduction of carbon footprint and increased
comfort and wellbeing. In addition, IoT will facilitate smooth and effective interaction of the lighting system with other
functions in a building such as e.g. HVAC, security and access control. Extensibility and security of the system architecture
are important aspects and will be guaranteed.
The OpenAIS project will define the requirements and use cases for offices in 2020, define the best open system
architecture, identify existing ICT components to be used and develop additional components. The system will be validated
by a pilot installation in a real office setting. After the OpenAIS project, the Consortium will pursue standardization of the
system architecture, aiming at the creation of the leading standard for Internet connected lighting.
The project brings together a strong collaboration of the leading lighting companies Zumtobel, Tridonic, and Philips and the
major players in IoT technology ARM, NXP and Imtech. Consortium partner Johnson Controls represents the end user and
academic knowledge on ICT and system architecture is present through TU/e and TNO-ESI. During the project, the

"Title: APACHE - Active & intelligent PAckaging materials and display cases as a tool for preventive conservation of Cultural Heritage. Abstract: Most Cultural Heritage objects housed by museums are often stored under unsuitable climate conditions. APACHE will develop a cutting edge technology to control and prevent the degradation of such patrimony. The novel approach is based on three pillars: 1) advanced sensing and absorbing materials to control the artifacts’ environment; 2) modeling to define the threshold of artifacts’ degradation and to discriminate between the need for preventive or remedial conservation; 3) remote control of the works of art stressors. The unique combination of these pillars will reduce to the lowest possible level the costs actually required by conventional technology for art conservation. New generation of active and intelligent display cases, crates, and storage boxes, will be implemented thanks to: i) The unique APACHE partnership, comprising the most important experts in the three aforementioned pillars; ii) The development of easy-to-use sensing devices able to communicate through Wireless Sensor Networks and Radio Frequency Identification Devices thanks to Industry 4.0-5.0 ICT technologies, granting the optimal environmental conditions around the art objects. Multiscale models integrated in an open simulation environment will be used to predict the degradation of artefacts and set the properties of sensors (detection limits) and polyfunctional absorbents. APACHE includes small, medium, and large museums exhibiting representative variety of display and storage conditions. For instance, the Venice Peggy Guggenheim Collection features one of the most important collections of modern/contemporary art, which experiences highly unfavorable environmental conditions, difficult to control with conventional tools. Centre Pompidou and National Museum of Hungary possess a vast amount of artefacts stored in deposits (e.g. in crates and boxes). Moreover, a decision-making tool composed by a modular set of decision trees will be offered to end-users to guide them through the best solutions.",True

"Title: SwiftV2X - Smart mmWave and MultiRATs for Multihop Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Abstract: The push for improved driving experience, including the ultimate goal of driverless vehicles, has fueled the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Connectivity is an important enabler for CAVs, as it allows for autonomous vehicles to directly participate in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) and make collective intelligent decisions. 5G mobile networks play an important role in providing vehicular connectivity as mobile networks support mobility by default. However, the density of vehicles is high in urban areas that poses challenges for the support from mobile networks. Deploying ultra-dense small cells using millimetre wave (mmWave) communication is one promising solution since ultra-dense small cells deployment addresses the network capacity and mmWave addresses the interference arisen from the dense deployment. However, due to the relatively narrow footprint of a mmWave beam, using mmWave communication for fast moving vehicles requires careful allocation to utilise its potential and avoid selfishness in radio resource usage. This project sets an ambitious goal of designing smart and dynamic algorithms to manage mmWave beam allocations in CAV environments. The project first investigates solely on the mmWave beam allocations and proposes smart algorithm using both traditional optimisation technique for benchmarking and modern machine learning algorithms for practical operation. It then studies the radio resource allocation under multi radio access technologies (multiRATs) that is the likely deployment setup before the full mmWave small cell networks become practical in the future. Finally, our study is extended to vehicle-to-vehicle communication using mmWave that can support delay sensitive message exchanges and range extension.

"Title: AdMiRe - Advanced Mixed Realities Abstract: The main goal of AdMiRe is to develop, validate and demonstrate innovation solutions, based on Mixed Reality (MR) technology, which will allow for TV audiences a step change in interactivity, and bring for content creators a radical improvement in talent immersion and interaction with computer generated elements. AdMiRe is focused on sectors where the lead industry partners in the consortium are key players, thus guaranteeing the impact of the innovation and the take up of the technology. 
At present, TV audiences can interact with the shows they are watching only through social media or HBBTV. Comments, video and audio from the audience may be incorporated into TV program formats, but this is done in such a way that viewer engagement is quite limited and there is not much potential for innovation. AdMiRe will radically change this by producing solutions that will allow viewers at home to be incorporated into the live TV program they are watching and to interact with people in the TV studio. The key innovation here is to use a regular mobile phone to capture the viewer, extract him/her from the background and finally composite the viewer into the studio footage as an MR object. 
As for content creators, be it in film, TV or live productions, there is an ever growing trend to combine actors and performers with computer generated objects and have them interact. But the number and difficulty of the technical challenges involved have resulted in methods and technologies of reduced scope, resulting in less engaging content. AdMiRe takes the exact opposite approach, producing authoring tools that remove the main technological obstacles and that will allow actors to be immersed in virtual environments, performers to feel at home within the space, and directors to have the opportunity to better capture emotion, all in all resulting in the possibility to create more compelling visuals and more engaging programming.",True
"Title: HoloRuminant - Understanding microbiomes of the ruminant holobiont Abstract: Sustainability of ruminant production is of concern to society because of its implications for the environment, the economy and food security. Microbiomes associated with the host play a key role in health, welfare and environmental efficiency in ruminant production systems. However, despite the information already available, we lack the insights to precisely link the causes and mechanisms of microbial influence on ruminant phenotypes. This is because the interconnection and communication between the animal and its different microbiomes have never been studied in a deep, integrated way. 
The goal of the project is to elucidate the role of ruminant-associated microbiomes and their interplay with the host in early life and throughout fundamental life events. HoloRuminant will use a holistic multi-omics approach to characterise the acquisition and evolution of microbiomes from different body sites, their inheritability and their influence on the host’s resistance to disease and environmental efficiency of production. Specifically we will: determine microbiomes’ functions by combining multi-level information for microbes, host and their interaction; define microbiomes’ roles during challenging life periods such as perinatal, weaning, and after exposure to pathogens; and evaluate the effect of ruminant microbiomes on critical phenotypes for sustainable production, health and welfare. This will allow the identification of novel microbial markers for monitoring, predicting and selecting phenotypes of interest. By engaging actors from the livestock value chain, we will evaluate the socio-economic impact and acceptability of the innovations proposed among stakeholders and the public.
HoloRuminant will provide highly innovative, standardized methodologies that will radically advance our understanding of the ruminant holobiont. This knowledge and the tools created will allow the use of microbiome-based diagnostics and solutions for improving ruminant sustainabilty.",False
"Title: CureCN - Adeno-Associated Virus Vector-Mediated Liver Gene Therapy for Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Abstract: Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CN) is a rare recessive disorder caused by mutations in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1(UGT1A1) gene. CN is a life-threatening disease with no cure which constitutes a severe burden for the patients, their families, and the society. CureCN has the objective of developing a curative gene therapy for CN syndrome based on liver gene transfer with and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing the UGT1A1 transgene. Additional goals of CureCN are to develop strategies to allow for vector re-administration and to address the issue of pre-existing anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which prevent large proportion of seropositive patients from receiving AAV mediated gene therapy. Proof-of-concept studies of AAV8-UGT1A1 gene transfer provide a strong rationale for the safety and efficacy of gene therapy for CN. CureCN proposes to carry out an open-label, multicenter clinical trial of AAV8-UGT1A1 gene transfer to prove the safety and efficacy of the therapy in severe CN patients, and file for marketing authorization in Europe at the end of the study. CureCN will also produce enabling data for the clinical translation of a groundbreaking immunomodulatory strategy to allow for vector administration. Additionally, a technology for the selective removal of anti-AAV NAbs from the bloodstream of seropositive patients will be developed. The goal of these studies is to ultimately allow all CN patients to access AAV8-UGT1A1 gene therapy. CureCN is a patient-driven initiative that gathers top clinicians and scientists; it also includes small medium enterprises in its partners, to foster economic growth and valorization of intellectual property. CureCN sets itself in the ambitious goal set by the IRDiRC by 2020 by developing a curative treatment for CN syndrome. Importantly, it validates technologies that will broaden the scope of gene therapy, thus will have an impact on the development of treatments for several other rare diseases.",False

"Title: NeuroUTR - Systematic investigation of the functional coupling between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying tissue-specific 3'UTRs variability. Abstract: 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) serve as a key platform in the RNA regulatory network that controls mRNA translational efficiency, localisation and stability. Of all human cell-types, brain-specific isoforms have the longest 3' UTRs and therefore their regulation is likely to be most complex. Moreover, mutations perturbing the mRNA secondary structure and sites of mRNA-miRNA interactions can lead to diseases such as neurodegeneration. Isoforms of variable 3' UTRs are engendered by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (polyA) site selection. Of the many factors contributing to this process, both transcriptional and RNA regulatory interactions have been extensively studied. Yet the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the systematic tissue-specific polyA site selection remain largely unknown. Here I hypothesise that changes in transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and polyA factors activities together regulate the condition-specificity of this process. Furthermore I hypothesise that the resulting 3' UTR sequence variation contributes to increased protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders such as motor neurone disease (MND), a common but incurable disorder in which mRNA metabolism and protein homeostasis are disrupted. Here using bioinformatic approaches I will integrate a variety of genomic measurements, and systematically identify tissue-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying polyA site selection. I will develop linear models to characterise the genome-wide functional coupling between these regulatory interactions and study how these associate with MND in regulating alternative 3' UTRs. In doing this project I will not only advance our current knowledge about RNA regulation but I will enable a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying MND, and in the long term, the future development of new therapies that ameliorate the regulation of 3' UTRs in neurodegenerative diseases.",False

DRAGON capacity-building strategy will enable expertise and skill transfer from Agri-EPI Centre, the UK and Wageningen University in the Netherlands to BIOS in order to enhance 1) BIOS’ researchers’ S&T capacity for performing multi-scale/multi-source data analyses; 2) BIOS’ researchers’ capability to communicate practical big data-related knowledge to various stakeholders across the supply chain and the non-scientific local communities. Specifically, this means that BIOS knowledge technologies research group, currently focused on data analytics only (science-driven research), will be enhanced through DRAGON into BIOS Knowledge & Innovation Group (KIG) concentrating on interdisciplinary innovation-driven R&D within a co-creation environment. Post DRAGON BIOS’ KIG will be competitive in the PA sector on European and Global levels.

"Title: FineSol - Assembly of miniaturized PCBs by using low cost hyper-fine solder powders Abstract: The total EU electronics industry employs ≈20.5 million people, sales exceeding €1 trillion and includes 396,000 SMEs. It is a major contributor to EU GDP and its size continues to grow fueled by demand from consumers to many industries. Despite its many positive impacts, the industry also faces some challenges connected with the enormous quantity of raw materials that it needs for sustainability, the huge quantity of Waste Electrical, Electronics Equipment (WEEE) generated and the threat of competition from Asia. To sustain its growth, to manage the impact of WEEE and to face the competition from Asia, the industry needs innovations in key areas. One such area is the drive for ultra-miniaturisation/ultlra-functionality of equipment. The key current road block/limitation to achieving the goal of ultra-miniaturisation/functionality is how to increase the component density on the printed circuit board (PCB). This is currently limited by the availability of hyper fine pitch solder powder pastes. FineSol aims to deliver at first stage an integrated production line for solder particles with size 1-10 μm and to formulate solder pastes containing these particles. Thus, by proper printing methods (e.g. screen and jet printing) the fabrication of  PCBs with more than double component density will be achieved. Consequently, this would effectively enable more than a doubling of the functions available on electronic devices such as cell phones, satellite navigation systems, health devices etc. The successful completion of the FineSol project would lift the ultra-miniaturisation/functionality road block and also enable reduction in raw material usage, reduction in WEEE, reduction in pollution and associated health costs and also a major reduction in EU energy demand with all its indirect benefits for environment and society.",True

"Title: IN-FET - Ionic Neuromodulation For Epilepsy Treatment Abstract: There is a need for a paradigm shift in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Several routes have been explored to modulate or silence dysfunctional neural circuits, through genetic, electrical, magnetic or optical means. All have serious limitations due to the unphysiological mechanisms used to regulate neuronal activity. In IN-FET, we address this issue by manipulating the elementary building blocks of cell excitability: ions. IN-FET tackles the visionary idea of altering neuronal firing and synaptic transmission by direct ionic actuation at the microscopic scale, while monitoring cell responses by arrays of nanoscale transistors. We will develop and test, in vitro, the use of active polymers to trap or release electrochemically specific ions in the extracellular milieu surrounding neurons. These will be integrated with ion sensors and ultra-sensitive nanowire arrays, offering closed-loop regulation of cellular electrical activity. We will deliver for the first time a device that can physiologically modulate the neuronal membrane potential, the synaptic release probability, and glutamatergic NMDA receptors activation by altering potassium, calcium, and magnesium ionic concentrations in a controlled and spatially-confined manner. High-resolution simultaneous probing of cell activity will be performed by Si-nanowire vertical transistors, penetrating the membranes and detecting the cell electrical activity at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. In conclusion, IN-FET's multidisciplinary consortium brings together state-of-the-art electrochemistry, 3-d nanofabrication, nanoelectronics, and numerical simulations, and combines neuronal biophysics to device modeling. IN-FET will thus establish the proof-of-principle for a breakthrough biocompatible neuromodulation technology, with a clear impact for future brain implants for epilepsy treatment, advancing neuroscience, biomedical microsystems engineering, and nano-neurotechnology.",False
"Title: CIMEC - Cooperative ITS for Mobility in European Cities Abstract: Call topic MG3.5-2014 notes that the deployment of C-ITS has not kept pace with the technological development, implying that deployment is being restrained by non-technical factors. CIMEC, as a proposed CSA for this topic, aims to support the accelerated take-up of C-ITS by increasing the alignment of technological solutions with user needs, thereby removing perceived barriers and risks in deployment.
European highways authorities are relatively well educated, prepared and supported regarding C-ITS, including through a series of EC- and national funded R&D projects. However the greatest benefits are expected through the more complex and fragmented city context, which up to now is much less understood. CIMEC focuses especially on this urban C-ITS context.
CIMEC brings together key collaborative institutions, supported by a panel of core cities and by the European city network Polis. This meta-network has extensive experience in bringing together cities and suppliers to optimise ITS, and has specific expertise in a range of C-ITS at national and European level.
The objectives of CIMEC are to
•capture and document a set of realistic use cases for C-ITS in cities, supported by robust business cases
•identify practical project structures which enable the deployment of these use cases
•identify how emerging standards for C-ITS will affect, and should respond to, urban systems and processes
•show possible system architecture and workflow of C-ITS support systems 
•promote multi-sector stakeholder dialogue, engagement and collaboration
The principal output will be a roadmap for city deployment of C-ITS which has been validated against user needs and technology maturity, captured in meaningful project descriptions. By developing a single, coherent narrative and communicating it effectively to all relevant stakeholder groups, this will ensure that standards, product development, project management, and policy goals are fully aligned across the European urban C-ITS context.",False
"Title: CAST - Active Monitoring of Cancer As An Alternative To Surgery Abstract: When a patient is discovered to have cancer, one of the primary goals is to have the tumour removed by surgery. Although
this provides excellent oncological control, it is associated with morbidity and functional problems in cancer survivors. Recent
studies have shown that the immediacy to perform a resection does not always lead to improved clinical outcome.
Furthermore, cancer surgery can often lead to complications where the quality of life for the patient is compromised by toxic
side effects and /or damage to nerves, organs or healthy tissues. A number of recent clinical trials in the field of cancer
surgery have advocated the concept of watch and wait, watchful waiting, active monitoring or surveillance, which are terms
used to describe a monitoring strategy for cancer. The concept may be antithetical but the functional advantage of these
alternatives is clear even though there is some concern about the risk. Though the evidence is still weak, current studies
suggest that with adequate selection and follow-up, this oncological risk is small. A major consideration for clinicians is now
to maintain quality of life for all patients. Our objective in this proposal is to implement novel approaches so that cancer
surgery can be avoided, where we aim to (a) develop new monitoring technologies from industry so that the surveillance
window can be increased to allow for better treatment options over time and to avoid surgery, (b) develop new ‘watch and
wait’ strategies in order to study the behaviour of the cancer so that any risks to the patient can be minimised leading to a
better clinical outcome and (c) train a new generation of preclinical and clinical scientists to be able to implement this new
concept as standard of care and to maximise the benefits of an active monitoring policy.",False

"Title: ORRmetIR - Development and in situ Infrared study of Novel Strained Core-shell Electrocatalysts: Towards an Understanding of the Oxygen Reduction Mechanism Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical in fuel cells (FC), batteries and corrosion. Sluggish kinetics of the ORR remains a key barrier to efficient electricity generation in FC operating on renewable fuels such as hydrogen or alcohols. Poor understanding of the ORR mechanism has hindered development of cost-effective and improved FC catalysts. 
This project aims to bring about a step change in development and understanding of ORR catalysts by (i) synthesising metal nanoparticles with a strained surface structure, and (ii) developing and implementing new in situ and operando infrared (IR) spectroscopic techniques to understand how strain impacts the ORR mechanism. Novel strained core-shell Pt-based catalysts will be developed, featuring a core of inexpensive metals including Ni, Co or Cu. For the first time, insight into the ORR mechanism for supported electrocatalysts under realistic catalytic turnover will be gained by modifying an approach to combining IR spectroscopy and electrochemistry developed in the Vincent group. 
The University of Oxford is uniquely suited for this ambitious project: the applicant will be hosted in a strong research culture in catalysis, have access to state-of-the-art research infrastructure and technical expertise in spectroscopy and materials characterisation and industrial collaborations. The fellow will receive broad-ranging training in the synthesis of catalysts and surface characterisation. The host team will benefit from her skills in in situ vibrational spectroscopy, especially spectral interpretation of ORR intermediates. 
This highly interdisciplinary project combines nanomaterial synthesis, spectroscopy and electrocatalysis, and has strong potential for generation of intellectual property and commercialisation of new catalysts for FC, aiding knowledge transfer between academic and industrial sectors.

"Title: IGNIS - Reuse of Tyre Fibres for Fire-Spalling-Proof Concrete Abstract: Fire-induced explosive spalling (violent peeling-off of concrete surface) is a major drawback of modern high-performance and high-strength concrete. Tunnels and buildings have been seen to experience catastrophic failure due to fire spalling of concrete, leading to huge economic costs and potential loss of life. Recent EU directives and legislation require adequate addressing of the spalling problem in any new project and all major existing road tunnels need to be upgraded. However, fire spalling still remains one of the least well understood aspects of concrete behaviour and the need to fill this knowledge gap has significantly increased, due to the increasing demand of infrastructure and materials that are sensitive to spalling. Therefore, the research community has set fire spalling as a research priority; a RILEM Technical Committee (TC256-SPF) has been dedicated to this topic. This research aims to develop a better understanding of the complex mechanism behind fire spalling as well as a novel sustainable spalling-mitigation solution by using waste fibres recovered from end-of-life tyres. If successful, this will enable manufactured polymer fibres, currently used to prevent fire-induced spalling, to be replaced with a reused product of equal or better performance, thereby providing a possible annual reduction of 0.5 million tonnes of CO2 in an EU market worth about £50 million per annum. The fire spalling risk will be investigated through high-temperature slab tests. The test data will be used to develop a predictive numerical model. The host organisation has world-leading expertise in the fields of fire engineering and sustainable concrete technology and it is current coordinating an EU project (ANAGENNISI) on the reuse of tyre components in concrete for ambient temperature applications. This project, along with training schemes available at the host organization, will be a unique opportunity for the fellow to develop his career as an independent researcher.",False

Thus the TreatER project has two independent goals, either of which alone can have significant impact addressing unmet clinical needs in chronic diseases, and advancing innovative European technologies:

1) Proof-of-concept of CDNF protein therapy for disease modification in PD. The patented European innovation CDNF has further potential in other ER stress related indications.

2) Clinical validation of DDS, an already clinically tested approach for accurately targeted intracerebral infusions in PD. The patented European innovation DDS has also significant potential in other indications needing intracerebral infusions.

The clinical study builds on extensive preclinical research and related data on CDNF, including completed acute and chronic toxicology studies in non-human primates supporting an excellent safety profile. Further, the clinical study builds on existing clinical experience on DDS and related neurosurgery.

Both conventional and novel means for assessing the efficacy of the treatment will be utilized. This requires strong interdisciplinary expertise and knowledge available in the consortium, including: Regulatory expertise in drug and medical device development; neurological and neurosurgical expertise in PD; PET imaging expertise specific to PD; Scientific expertise in novel neurotrophic factors, in specific CDNF; and GMP manufacturing expertise of novel biological drug compounds.

"Title: FRAMES - Fibre Reinforced thermoplAstics Manufacturing for stiffEned, complex, double curved Structures. Abstract: The fuselage of the next generation of Large Passenger Aircrafts´ (LPA) will be made with thermoplastic (TP) composites. In fact, even if this kind of materials are being increasingly used in aerospace industry, as they contribute to lighter aircrafts and consequently to fuel consumption reduction, there are still some issues to be overcome until this becomes a reality.
The manufacturing complex forms of rear end section with continuous fibre-reinforced TP still poses a considerable challenge: higher processing temperatures and raw material costs, need of complex temperature-controlled tooling, etc. Automated fibre placement (AFP) is a workable alternative for more complicated TP Composites (TPC) shapes with varying part thickness (e.g., fuselage shells, wing and stabilizer torsion boxes and stringers), but one of the challenges is void removal, which is more difficult with TP than with thermosets. 
FRAMES aims to fully define technical and cost performance of an optimized integral TP rear end manufacturing process with critical design features as an alternative to thermoset materials. Thanks to a self-heated tool with process driven heating zones and advanced lay up process simulation, FRAMES will be capable of predicting heating law for efficient TP-AFP, correlated with lay-up trials, mastering TP-stiffeners manufacturing process, optimizing co-consolidation cycle. Its main innovation relies on the co-consolidation of a double curved and thick skin with its entire stiffening structure in one shot.
FRAMES will support the spread of alternative heating process for thermoplastic AFP by developing a simulation tool able to predefine processing parameters of the most common aerospace grades thermoplastics. At the end, the advanced rear end (ARE) concept that will allow the savings (NRC and maintenance costs, higher integration level at lighter weight, etc.)  will be easily applicable to other panels or structures with the same interface principle or same architecture",False
"Title: EPICut - Molecular mechanisms, evolutionary impacts and applications of prokaryotic epigenetic-targeted immune systems Abstract: Interactions between bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) have led to the evolution of a wide range of bacterial mechanisms to resist viral infection. The exploitation of such systems has produced true revolutions in biotechnology; firstly, the restriction-modification (RM) enzymes for genetic engineering, and secondly, CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing. This project aims to unravel the mechanisms and consequences of prokaryotic immune systems that target covalently-modified DNA, such as base methylation, hydroxymethylation and glucosylation. Very little is known about these Type IV restriction enzymes at a mechanistic level, or about their importance to the coevolution of prokaryotic-phage communities. I propose a unique interdisciplinary approach that combines biophysical and single-molecule analysis of enzyme function, nucleoprotein structure determination, prokaryotic evolutionary ecology, and epigenome sequencing, to link the molecular mechanisms of prokaryotic defence to individual, population and community-level phenotypes. This knowledge is vital to a full understanding of how bacterial immunity influences horizontal gene transfer, including the spread of virulence or antimicrobial resistance. In addition, a deeper analysis of enzyme function will support our reengineering of these systems to produce improved restriction enzyme tools for the mapping of eukaryotic epigenetics markers.",False

The target will be a 10x or more capacity increase by employing 10 or more OAM multiplexed channels over a conventional WDM system. The combination of 10x OAM states with 16 wavelength channels will provide a total of 160 multiplexed channels. Full compatibility with legacy technologies will be demonstrated. Speciality fibres will be employed to support OAM modes transmission in the range up to 2 km.
The second objective is to exploit the use of OAM domain as a switching resource in conjunctions with the wavelength domain to significantly improve the scalability and the power consumption of the switches in data-centres applications. A 10x improvement of the scalability of the data-centre switches will be targeted with the study and development of an OAM-based switch compatible with the WDM layer. A switch exploiting 10 OAM modes and 16 wavelengths as switching domains will be implemented. The developed two-layer switch will enable a more than 10x reduction of power consumption/Gb/s with respect to the current commercial switches. OAM switch configuration time of 100 ns will be demonstrated, with 8x improvement with respect to commercial switches.
The project goals will be enabled by integrated high performance OAM components build on silicon photonics technology.

"Title: 7SHIELD - Safety and Security Standards of Space Systems, ground Segments and Satellite data assets, via prevention, detection, response and mitigation of physical and cyber threats Abstract: The project addresses the security and the resilience of EU Ground Segments of Space Systems, meeting the crosscutting and the sectorial criteria of the EU critical infrastructures (2008/14). The Copernicus era has created a new market with the massive amounts of satellite data that the ground segments of space systems receive serve to the market and governmental bodies. A physical/cyber-attack to their installations or communication networks, respectively, would cause debilitating impact on public safety and security of EU citizens and public authorities. A physical attack on a space ground segment makes the distribution of satellite data problematic and, on the other hand, a cyber-attack in its data storage, access and exchange affects not only the reliability of space data, but also their FAIR standards: findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Current approaches do not fully exploit the recent advances in surveillance mechanisms with robotic technologies and AI. 7SHIELD will be an integrated yet flexible and adaptable framework enabling the deployment of innovative services for cyber-physical protection of ground segments, such as e-fences, passive radars and laser technologies, multimedia AI technologies, that enhance their protection capabilities, while integrating or interoperating with existing protection solutions already deployed at their installations. The framework will integrate advanced technologies for data integration, processing, and analytics, machine learning and recommendation systems, data visualization and dashboards, data security and cyber threat protection. The technological solution is co-designed with first responders’ teams and contributes to policy making, standardisation and new guidelines for contingency planning and service continuity. The project will be evaluated and demonstrated in five installations of ground segments of space systems.",True
"Title: TESTBED - Testing and Evaluating Sophisticated information and communication Technologies for enaBling a smartEr griD Abstract: Smart grid represents a significant new technology of improving the efficiency, reliability, and economics of the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity. It is crucial to exchange and use information for performing smart grid applications. However, in reality the exchange of information over multiple networks is unreliable, leading to unpredictable network Quality-of-Service and thus unreliable smart grid applications. What’s worse, there are massive data, including metering data and measurement data,  structured or unstructured, making it challenging to exploit useful information. Hence, there is an urgent need to solve the research problem: how to coordinate multiple networks to reliably transmit data, and then manage ICT system resources to efficiently extract useful information for supporting smart grid applications?
TESTBED is a major interdisciplinary project that combines wisdoms in three academic disciplines - Electronics Engineering, Power Engineering and Computing Sciences, to address the aforesaid problem. The main focus is on improving the communication layer interoperability and the efficiency of data analytic. Regarding the communication layer interoperability, this project intends to develop and evaluate function-driven communication frameworks. Moreover, this project will develop and verify new data integration and analytic techniques for enhancing power grid operations. These developed frameworks and methods will be extensively tested and evaluated in 4 well-equipped Laboratories at HWU, EPRI, ICCS, and CAS. They will not only support the SGAM Framework, but also complement and enhance International Standards. 
Overall, the main objective of this project is to coordinate the action of 5 Universities and 3 enterprises, working in the field of ICT and smart grid from both EU and China, to build and test sophisticated ICT, thereby facilitating the successful implementation of smart grid applications.",True
"Title: FLAMINGO - Fulfilling enhanced Location Accuracy in the Mass-market through Initial GalileO services Abstract: The success of Galileo will largely depend on its uptake in LBS and IoT markets. Leveraging on Galileo’s features that improve performance in urban environment, FLAMINGO will unleash GNSS mass-market potential.

The overarching objectives of FLAMINGO are to develop and deliver high accuracy and reliable positioning and navigation services for mass market uptake, to demonstrate the potential by developing and showcasing ready to market applications on both Smartphone and IoT devices within major European cities, and to foster a new community of E-GNSS consumers and applications. FLAMINGO shall produce a service targeting accuracies of 50cm (95%) and better, employing multi-constellation, PPP and RTK mechanisms, power consumption optimisation techniques as well as the GNSS raw measurements availability.

FLAMINGO will deliver hardware and software that utilise the service to its full potential. Technology triggers for mobile devices are provided by Google through the provision of the GNSS raw measurements API that provide access to pseudorange and carrier phase (a prerequisite for the highest order accuracy GNSS positioning) and by various commercial smartphone manufacturers who support these measurements. IoT devices currently provided by three of the consortium partners will be modified, enhanced, and made available for the validation activities. The project will develop and deliver a series of market-ready Galileo enabled IoT and commercial LBS applications in three urban areas that support European ambitions on Smart Cities namely Barcelona (ES), Toulouse (F) and the Gdansk/ Gdynia/Sopot Tricity (PL).

"Title: NeMESIS - Neuron-based Monitoring Electrochemical Bio-Sensor Interface System Abstract: Reliable, real-time detection systems for in-vivo, continuous monitoring of biological and chemical processes consist a crucial aspect in personalised healthcare. Nevertheless, even nowadays, the medical practice still lacks of systems providing a rapid, reliable and ultra-sensitive sensing in a continuous way. Meanwhile, inflammatory markers consist a pivotal tool in clinical practice since they may be indicators of specific diseases, along with signalising the response of a patient to a specific medical treatment. Nanotechnology-based devices exhibiting memristive electrical properties show great potential for delivering highly scalable, resilient, power efficient and reconfigurable electronic systems. In addition, when those particular nanodevices are subjected to appropriate surface treatments and implemented in the role of bio-inspired sensors, they can bring solutions and introduce novelty to the bio-sensing field regarding highly sensitive and robust detection of biomarkers, while expanding and broadening the research field and applications involving memristive phenomena. In the framework of this fellowship, a flexible, low-cost miniaturised minimally invasive sensing platform will be developed, implementing memristive nanoscale devices as intelligent bio-interfaces, allowing reliable, continuous and real-time monitoring of inflammatory markers. This scheme will be accomplished by the fabrication of a memristor-based sensing platform conjugated with a sensing membrane and an accordingly designed binding assay. Validation of the sensing platform for continuous monitoring will be followed by the integration on flexible substrates for in vivo measurements and integration with readout circuitry enabling the sensing data readout and the wireless transmission to a tablet or smartphone. Finally, the sensing platform will be applied for in-vivo, real-time monitoring, for the detection of inflammatory markers and for indicating the response to an applied treatment.",True
"Title: VisiOn - Visual Privacy Management in User Centric Open Environments Abstract: Public Administration (PA) authorities are working towards upgrading the level of their
online services through new governance models such as the Open Government. This pushes
for greater transparency, accountability and innovation aiming at increasing citizen levels of
confidence and trust in PA online services. In this context, user data privacy is an important
issue. VisiOn will deliver a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Visual Privacy
Management Platform, which empowers any citizen to achieve desired levels of privacy by
creating and monitoring a personal Privacy Level Agreement. The platform will provide clear
visualisation of privacy preferences, relevant threats and trust issues along with an insight into
the economic value of user data. The platform will equip PAs with the right tools to improve
the transparency and accountability of their operations, by supporting visual analysis of (i)
privacy issues at different levels (e.g. design, run-time) and perspectives (i.e. citizen, PA); (ii)
regulation compliance; and (iii) business/operational processes. The VisiOn consortium will
leverage existing software, tools and methodologies, which partners have developed in
previous projects, towards the implementation of the privacy platform software components.
The latter will be tested in an operational environment (i.e. TRL 7), in three different pilot
scenarios across two different scenario types (i.e. citizen/PA & PA/cross-border PA). Pilots
will involve users from three European countries. Driven by the lack of appropriate products
in the market, as identified by the relevant market analysis, the VisiOn exploitation strategy is
based on commercialisation of the project results at three levels: platform-as-a-whole,
fragments of the platform, and partner individual exploitation. This strategy will enable

"Title: ELLIS-SDI - Elliptic Integrable Systems: solutions, deformations and integrability Abstract: The proposal studies relativistic generalizations of quantum integrable models of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) type and their deformations, and the correspondence between the CMS models and the Painlevé hierarchies. It is divided into several parts.  The first part investigates the van Diejen model (which is the most complicated model in the CMS family) and its sophisticated limiting case proposed by Takemura. The aim is to construct exact eigenfunctions of these two models using the kernel function methods. These eigenfunctions belong to an emerging new class in the theory of special functions.  The second part is devoted to the study of integrable deformations of the relativistic CMS model (Ruijsenaars model), going back to the works of Chalykh, Feigin, Veselov and Sergeev. In the trigonometric case, the deformed models are known to be integrable and the eigenfunctions of the principal Hamiltonian are given in terms of super-Macdonald polynomials. Using the kernel function identities, I will prove that all higher Hamiltonians of this model are diagonalized by the super-Macdonald polynomials. This will be used to establish orthogonality of the super-Macdonald polynomials. Extending this, I plan to establish integrability of the elliptic case. Furthermore, by using algebraic tools such as Cherednik operators and double affine Hecke algebras, and building upon a recent work of Chalykh, I will construct quantum Lax matrices for the deformed models in all cases.  Lastly, we aim to find a conceptual link between elliptic Cherednik algebras and higher Painlevé systems. Namely, first we will obtain the classical Inozemtsev system from Cherednik algebra by a Hamiltonian reduction. By relating this to the recent results of Bertolo, Cafasso, and Rubtsov, we will then find an alternative and more natural interpretation of the higher Painlevé equations as isomonodromic deformations.",False
"Title: GOLIATH - Beating Goliath: Generation Of NoveL, Integrated and Internationally Harmonised Approaches for Testing Metabolism Disrupting Compounds Abstract: GOLIATH addresses the work programme topic ‘SC1-BHC-27-2018: New testing and screening methods to identify endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)’ by focussing on one of the most urgent regulatory needs, namely the lack of methods for testing EDCs that disrupt metabolism – chemicals collectively referred to as ‘metabolism disrupting chemicals’ (MDCs). MDCs are natural and anthropogenic chemicals that have the ability to promote metabolic changes that can ultimately result in obesity, diabetes and/or fatty liver in humans.  GOLIATH will generate the world’s first integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) specifically tailored to MDCs. With a focus on the main cellular targets of metabolic disruption – hepatocytes, pancreatic endocrine cells, myocytes and adipocytes - GOLIATH will develop new methods and optimise existing methods that span the entire adverse outcome pathway (AOP) spectrum, using in silico predictive modelling and high throughput screening, (pre-)validated ready-to-use in vitro assays and optimised in vivo toxicity testing guidelines. GOLIATH will provide key information on the endocrine mode of action by which MDCs disrupt metabolic pathways and induce adverse effects on human health by incorporating multi-omics technologies, and translating results from in vitro and in vivo assays to adverse metabolic health outcomes in humans at real life exposures. Given the importance of international acceptance of the developed test methods for regulatory use, GOLIATH will link with ongoing initiatives of the OECD for test method (pre-)validation, IATA and AOP development.  With a consortium comprised of world-leading experts in endocrinology, molecular biology, toxicology, epidemiology, test method development, validation and chemical regulation, GOLIATH will be pivotal in the development of an internationally harmonised strategy for testing MDCs, and help to reduce the worldwide rise in metabolic disorders that have reached ‘Goliathan’ proportions.",False
"Title: WFNQMC - Development of a Novel Computational Toolbox for Stochastic Electronic Structure in Chemistry and Condensed Matter Abstract: Atomistic computational modelling is increasingly an integral component of almost all areas of chemistry, physics and materials science, especially as its predictive ability improves. However, not all systems are equal when it comes to the predictive capabilities of current methods, and many systems are too large or many-body effects too complex to be routinely tractable. The result is that the promise of ‘materials by design’, deduction of reaction pathways or routine simulation on a par with experimental accuracy has not in general come to fruition. This ambitious proposal aims to address this, with development of a suite of novel approaches to stochastically sample the wavefunction. Recent work by the PI has already made huge strides in this direction, with an emerging approach in quantum chemical space having remarkable success for accurate solutions of small problems. Here, we first propose a number of novel developments to order to extend this approach from a tool for small systems to a widespread disruptive technology, with application to a variety of challenging problems. This involves development of the scope, scaling, accuracy and capabilities of this sampling, including admitting time-dependent, spectral and relativistic extensions. Next, we aim to take the successful philosophy of this sampling and exploit its powerful approach in order to reformulate a number of well-established electronic structure tools. Allowing stochasticity has the potential to yield low-scaling formulations of these methods, able to naturally exploit inherent sparsity, and have a revolutionary impact on their use and success. This proposal is highly interdisciplinary, spanning a range of applications and techniques in quantum chemistry, condensed matter and materials science, brought together under the banner of exploiting inherent sparsity by establishing a new paradigm of stochastic tools for correlated electrons, with the opportunity for tremendous impact in a number of fields.",False
"Title: TADFORCE - Strengthening and survey beyond the knowledge of the TADF emitters as materials  for superefficient OLED devices Abstract: The OLED worldwide market is growing rapidly and Europe needs experts possessing a comprehensive knowledge and practical experience in this technology. OLED technology is used in small devices such as smart phones and tablets but also in high-end TVs and lighting, as OLEDs are still relatively expensive compared to LCD. But with research progressing towards lower cost and longer lifetime, together with a growing trend to use flexible displays in smartphones etc., the OLED market is growing fast. Europe is a huge supplier of the materials for OLED displays, taking in to account that electronic market is changing very fast and companies are search for new cheaper materials the input of research in this area is needed.

"Title: LSFM4LIFE - Production and characterization of endocrine cells derived from human pancreas organoids for the cell-based therapy of type 1 diabetes Abstract: Self-renew and multilineage potential characterize stem cells.  We have recently described that pancreas progenitor cells extracted from adult donors can be expanded long-term in vitro into 3D structures, which we have termed organoids.  Pancreas organoids reproduce in vitro all the features of pancreas ductal epithelia, and have a limitless expansion potential.  Thus, pancreas organoids promise to boost cell therapy of type 1 diabetes.  We have recently observed that progenitor cells organoids preserve their genetic stability over a long time in culture. That represents an advantage, when compared to iPS or hES derived approaches, where genetic instability raises concerns for their future therapeutic applications.  While progenitor organoids are promising for the future of cell therapy, bringing stem cell-based therapies to patients requires a reliable characterization (“knowing what the cells do and how they do it”, i.e. a phenotypic and molecular biology characterization), chemically well-defined culture media, and the capacity of mass-production under GLP/GMP conditions.
The LSFM4LIFE consortium aims to the mass production of pancreas organoids for the cellular therapy of type 1 diabetes.  The goals of the project are: (1) optimize growth and differentiation of human pancreas stem-cell organoids by employing phenotypic and molecular high-throughput screening (2) standardize the growth and differentiation of the organoids under well-defined biochemical conditions, and (3) achieve GLP/GMP-production of the human organoids for preclinical studies and phase I clinical studies.

Computation at the network edge is key to supporting many emerging applications, from extended reality to smart health, smart cities, smart factories and autonomous driving. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is being developed to deliver the required computation functionalities closer to user devices, directly at mobile access points. GREENEDGE is motivated by the fact that the large scale adoption of MEC technology, while benefiting human productivity and efficiency, will result in a surge of data and computation in mobile networks, which, in turn, will exacerbate their energy consumption. GREENEDGE is set out to tame the growing carbon footprint of MEC technology, devising highly energy efficient communication and computing functionalities for the network edge, combining them with ambient energy sources and with new energy storage and supply paradigms.

"Title: TalkingHeads - TalkingHeads: Audiovisual Speech Recognition in-the-wild Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition refers to the problem of recognizing speech using both audio and video information. Speech is not a purely auditory process but the way that the listener perceives it is also through the recognition of the visual patterns associated with the mouth movement. This correlation of the audio-visual information has been occasionally explored in literature in order to develop more robust automatic speech recognition systems for cases in which the auditory environment is noisy (e.g. background noise, multiple speakers). However, the problem of audio-visual speech recognition has been mainly studied in controlled, laboratory conditions. TalkingHeads proposes, for the first time, the problem of audio-visual speech recognition in unconstrained (in-the-wild) videos collected from real-world multimedia databases and a set of methodologies that will work well under the assumed in-the-wild setting. 

TalkingHeads brings together a talented but experienced researcher (ER) with expertise in speech analysis (diarization and recognition) and the Supervisor with large research experience in Computer Vision for face analysis in-the-wild (recognition, detection, alignment and tracking, and facial expression analysis). TalkingHeads will establish the ER as an independent and internationally recognized researcher in the area of audio-visual fusion and speech recognition. Through TalkingHeads’ achievable work plan, the ER will attain a high level of research maturity by (a) complementing his expertise on speech analysis through extensive training in Computer Vision, (b) conducting research on a challenging research problem (audio-visual speech recognition in-the-wild) with significant career opportunities in both the academia and the industry, (c) publishing at high impact factor  conferences and journals, (d) establishing a network of research collaborators, and (e) enhancing personal skills (e.g. supervisory experience, leadership and management skills).",True

The network is interdisciplinary, intersectoral, unconventional and ambitious. It is unconventional in the sense that it connects stakeholders from seemingly separately developed fields: computational harmonic analysis, numerical linear algebra, computer algebra, nonlinear approximation theory, digital signal processing and their applications, in one and more variables. It is ambitious because the consortium stretches from mathematics to computational science and engineering and industry.  Multi-exponential analysis might sound remote, but it touches our daily lives in many surprising ways, even if most people are unaware of how important it is. For example, a substantial amount of effort in signal processing and time series analysis is essentially dedicated to the analysis of multi-exponential functions. Multi-exponential analysis is also fundamental to several research fields and application domains that are the subject of the EXPOWER proposal: remote sensing, antenna design, digital imaging, testing and metrology, all impacting some major societal or industrial challenges such as energy, transportation, space research, health and telecommunications.  The EXPOWER Beneficiaries and Third Country Partners, each bringing in their own complementary expertise, aim at solving some core challenges where the different domains involved with multi-exponential analysis meet.

"Title: MACROPRU - Investigating new policies for financial stability that do not create inequality Abstract: ""The primary aim of the action is to investigate how new macroprudential policies can influence financial stability without contributing to inequality in society. In this project we aim to apply cutting-edge, agent-based simulation techniques to uncover the redistributive effects of macroprudential policies and to examine the combination optimality of the macroprudential tools from the social welfare perspective. The results of this project will complement the conclusions extracted from the ECB system-wide stress-testing exercises by providing data on the rise of inequality in EU countries due to the adoption of new financial regulations. It will also supplement the macroeconomic impact assessment for the Basel III reforms (cost-benefit """"Growth-at-Risk"""" approach).

It provides us with the practical knowledge of how to take into account the heterogeneity of the agents in the models and how to apply new Bayesian estimation techniques. The results of the project may guide policymakers and central bankers on how to reshape financial regulations and to calibrate macroprudential policies in order to minimize adverse social effects and to reduce inequality (by supporting a social policy).

"Title: NEURO_NMD - Functional impact of alternative splicing coupled to nonsense-mediated decay in developing neurons Abstract: Differentiation of precursor cells into mature neurons relies on transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression that have to be coordinated in a precise spatiotemporal fashion. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing coupled to nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD) is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism known to orchestrate gene expression dynamics in developmental contexts. Earlier studies identified several neural targets of this pathway; however, in most cases, the extent to which AS-NMD contributes to the overall gene expression dynamics and biological significance of this regulation is poorly understood. Moreover, whether AS-NMD target repertoire undergoes considerable changes in developing brain and how this might fit to the global regulation network underlying neuronal differentiation remains unclear. I will address these questions using two separate approaches. First, I will investigate novel AS-NMD targets encoding actin cytoskeleton factors and controlled by an important regulator of neuronal alternative splicing, Ptbp1. I will elucidate the extent of AS-NMD regulation in these genes by modulating the inclusion of the NMD-promoting exons with corresponding antisense oligonucleotides. in mouse embryonic stem cells undergoing neuronal differentiation, neural stem cells and primary neurons. Second, I will systematically analyse how NMD contributes to different stages of neuronal development by acutely inhibiting this pathway in a time-resolved manner using genetic means. I will then identify gene expression effects and functional consequences of NMD inactivation using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and appropriate cell biological methods. All in all, this work will provide critical quantitative insights into AS-NMD functions and uncover novel mechanisms allowing neurons to attain their unique morphological and functional properties.",False

At 16 case study sites having a variety of scales, aquaculture at different trophic levels with different environmental interactions and most importantly with a range of key space-related development constraints as defined by local stakeholders, we will assess appropriate tools using a common process so as to facilitate synthesis and comparison. This case study approach will generate a large amount of information and is allocated about a third of the project’s resources. The project will develop the outcomes leading to a set of evaluated tools for facilitating the aquaculture planning process by overcoming present constraints. This information will be presented on an interactive web-based platform with tailored entry points for specific user types (e.g. planners, farmers, public) to enable them to navigate to the tools most appropriate to their application. The knowledge and information gained during this process will be developed into an on-line module at Masters Level which will also be developed into a short CPD course aimed at aquaculture planning professionals. The public will be engaged by an innovative school video competition and a vehicle to ensure project legacy will be established.",True
"Title: ER_disease - Defining hormonal cross-talk and the role of mutations in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer Abstract: Estrogen Receptor (ER) is the driving transcription factor in ~75% of all breast cancers. ER antagonists are routinely used for treatment, but significant variability exists in clinical response. We are interested in explaining this heterogeneity and exploiting the mechanistic insight. We have recently identified important, but previously uncharacterised cross-talk between ER and the progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) pathways, both of which are commonly expressed in ER+ tumours. Recently, ER has been shown to be mutated in ~18-55% of metastatic breast cancers. In addition, two key ER-chromatin regulatory proteins, FoxA1 and GATA3, are mutated in primary ER+ disease. Finally we have discovered three previously unknown phosphorylation events on FoxA1. 

Aim 1: We will comprehensively explore the cross-talk that exists between ER and PR and AR pathways to determine the physiological effects on ER function. Aim 2: We will recapitulate the key mutations observed in ER, FoxA1 and GATA3, to assess the impact on ER-DNA interactions, ER transcriptional activity and cell growth and drug response. This will be explored under different hormonal contexts to identify how the mutational spectrum influences the cross-talk between ER and the parallel PR and AR pathways. Aim 3: We will identify upstream kinase pathways that influence FoxA1 and GATA3 function. Aim 4: We will establish a novel single locus chromatin purification method for isolation of specific chromatin loci, followed by Mass Spectrometry to characterise the potential role of PR and AR variants and to identify unknown regulatory factors. 

Given recent biological discoveries and technological advances, we are perfectly positioned to apply cutting-edge tools to glean mechanistic insight into the factors that determine variability within ER+ disease. This proposal aims to advance our understanding of ER+ tumour heterogeneity, revealing ways of exploiting this in a clinically meaningful manner.",False
"Title: GEO-SAFE - Geospatial based Environment for  Optimisation Systems Addressing Fire Emergencies Abstract: In EU and Australia, every year thousands of square miles of forests and other lands burn due to wildfires. These fires cause important economic and ecological losses, and often, human casualties. Both EU and Australian governments are aware of how crucial it is to improve wildfires’ management and containment . Scientists from different specialties, both in EU and Australia, have already developed methods and models in order to  improve the management and decision process  pertaining to preparedness and response phases in case of bushfire. The present project, named Geospatial based Environment for Optimisation Systems Addressing Fire Emergencies (GEO SAFE), aims at  creating a  network enabling the two regions to exchange  knowledge, ideas and experience , thus  boosting the progress of wildfires knowledge  and the related development of innovative methods for dealing efficiently with such fires. 
More precisely, the GEO SAFE project will focus on developing the tools enabling to set up an integrated decision  support system optimizing the resources  during the response phase, through:
• Developing a dynamic risk cartography of a region with regard to the possibility of a wildfire. The task will involve data collection (satellite and remote sensors),  risk analysis and  development  of a tool   enabling to forecast fire extension i, and in particular to predict  fire and risk evolution during the response phase
• Designing and testing a resource allocation tool for the response phase using the dynamic risk cartography. One of the problems to consider will be the resource allocation for securing key places (schools, hospitals, ….) given time dependent constraints. Problems will be identified through connections with final users, and the proposed solutions will be tested on simulated data.
• Developing analyses of relevant management processes as well as training tools in order to facilitate the implementation of such solutionto be completed",True
"Title: NoHoW - Evidence-based ICT tools for weight loss maintenance Abstract: Most adults who try to lose weight fail to maintain it. Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).
Current research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.

Information technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. 
The NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.

Impact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK’s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000+ consumers. Commercialisation of project results will provide much needed WLM services that promote health education and long-term weight management programmes.",True
"Title: Class II PI3K - Characterization of the signalling and physiological roles of the class II PI3Ks Abstract: Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are lipid kinases that generate intracellular second messengers in signal transduction and membrane trafficking pathways and are important drug targets. This proposal seeks to delineate the roles and mechanism of action of a group of PI3Ks which have remained enigmatic ever since their discovery over a decade ago.
The PI3K family comprises eight members in three subclasses. Class I PI3Ks signal downstream of growth factor and G protein-coupled receptors, are amongst the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and are being exploited as drug targets. The class II and III PI3Ks have in part emerged as regulators of membrane trafficking pathways but their physiological roles remain poorly understood.
We aim to identify the physiological roles of the class II PI3K-C2α and β and to characterize the impact of their kinase activity on signalling pathways. To analyse the roles of class II PI3K activity in vivo, the Host Laboratory has created constitutive global and conditional knock-in kinase-inactive mice (unpublished). In contrast to PI3K gene knockout models, these mouse lines allow us to specifically address kinase-dependent functions and hence are an ideal model to evaluate the potential of class II PI3Ks as drug targets.
The class II PI3K-C2α (C2α) is involved in endo- and exocytosis as well as endocytic recycling, whereas PI3K-C2β (C2β) has been implicated in cell migration. However, their influence on cellular signalling is unknown. As an initial approach, the Host Laboratory performed a screen for proteins interacting with C2α or C2β (unpublished). We will explore hits from this screen using the kinase-inactive knock-in mice and cells derived thereof as discovery tools. 
The combination of my expertise in membrane traffic and phosphoinositide regulation with the mouse and signalling studies of the Host Laboratory form an excellent and timely basis to uncover the roles of the class II PI3Ks in mammalian biology.",False
"Title: BoneMalar - Mechanisms of bone marrow sequestration during malaria infection Abstract: Malaria remains a major problem of public health in developing countries. It is responsible for about 600000 deaths per year, predominantly children in sub-Saharan Africa. There is an urgent need for novel therapies as resistance against current treatments is widespread. The complex parasite biology requires a multifaceted approach targeting multiple life cycle stages and virulence pathways. The pathogenesis of the most deadly of human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, is related to the capability of infected red blood cells to sequester in deep tissues. Sequestration is critical for the completion of the red blood cell cycle because the release of parasites into the blood circulation allows recognition by surveillance macrophages and clearance in the spleen. A series of studies have since led to the understanding that sequestration of asexually replicating parasites is caused by the adherence of parasite infected red blood cells to the vascular endothelium of various tissues in the body.
 We have recently demonstrated that gametocytes, the only stage capable of transmission to the mosquito vector, develop in the extravascular environment of the human bone marrow. Preliminary studies in the mouse model have confirmed this finding and also suggest existence of an asexual reservoir in the bone marrow. In this innovative multidiscipinary proposal we aim to investigate the host pathogen interactions at the interface between infected red blood cell and bone marrow vasculature. Specifically we will focus on the following questions: how do parasites home to bone marrow? What are the changes in the bone marrow endothelium upon infection? How do parasites adhere with and transmigrate across the vascular endothelium in the bone marrow? The proposed studies initiate detailed characterization of a new paradigm in malaria parasite interaction with the host vasculature and provide a compelling new avenue for intervention strategies.",False

This will introduce NFC technology at lower cost and without substantial changes to product dimensions and mechanical characteristics. Moreover, one-time programmable memory (PROM) will enable additional functionality. NFC chip development will be ready for implementation in the “up-scaled” production facility at Pragmatic Printing (>100Mn chips/year). As a result, the PING consortium represents the value chain (design, manufacturing, integration, assembly and conversion) of NFC-enabled products in Europe and will secure follow-on commercialisation for volume production. More specifically the PING objectives are as follows:
1) Development of a Process Design Kit (PDK) for automated design of complex integrated circuits in scalable metal-oxide technology and compatible with standard simulation tools

"Title: AdMoRe - Empowered decision-making in simulation-based engineering: Advanced Model Reduction for real-time, inverse and optimization in industrial problems Abstract: “AdMoRe: Empowered decision-making in simulation-based engineering: Advanced Model Reduction for real-time, inverse and optimization in industrial problems” aims at providing in-depth training of Early Stage Researches (ESRs) in the development and application of state-of-the-art computational models and numerical methods to solve cutting-edge engineering problems. The main driving factors of all the beneficiaries are reduced order modeling techniques for real-time, inverse and optimization problems. In fact, these issues are seen by industry as a major asset to increase performance and competitiveness. The ultimate goal is to produce the next generation of European research engineers, leaders in the use of these methodologies for industry related problems.
To achieve the ETN objectives, AdMoRe is based on training-through-research of ESRs with personalized frontier-research projects and active participation in network activities (viz. industrial placements, AdMoRe schools, conferences, dissemination, organization of events). Training will involve multi-disciplinary modeling (i.e. solids, fluids, structures, electromagnetics, acoustics), inter-disciplinary modeling (i.e. fluid-structure interaction, electro-magneto-mechanics, thermo-mechanics, aerodynamic noise) and new emerging scientific fields (i.e. geometrically enhanced finite elements/volumes, reduced order techniques, validation…), with a highlighted industrial edge bringing necessary transversal skills (i.e. through active involvement of the industrial partners). 
Furthermore, ESRs will be trained to develop core entrepreneurial skills to successfully move ideas into commercial practice through a series of transversal-entrepreneurship modules, as part of their training. The active involvement of industrial partners in AdMoRe ensures that both the research development and the ESR training will deliver research engineers that will be able to lead computer modeling in European industry and enterprise.",True
"Title: DIBOR - Unsymmetric diborane(4) compounds for small molecule activation and B-B coupling Abstract: Organoboron complexes are ubiquitous in synthesis due to their utility in functional group transformations and the Nobel Prize winning Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. Furthermore, the advent of frustrated Lewis pair chemistry and BB multiple bonds has demonstrated that organoboron compounds can activate small molecules (e.g., CO) and sigma bonds (including H2), reactivity previously thought to be the domain of transition metal catalysts. As part of the renaissance in organoboron chemistry diborane(4) compounds (R2B-BR2) have received considerable interest, particularly that react as boryl anion equivalents.  Recent unpublished work at UNIMAN has developed an efficient, scalable route to a synthetically useful unsymmetric diborane(4) compound, specifically (RO)2B-BCl2(NHC), (1, NHC = N-heterocyclic Carbene). The DIBOR project will exploit this breakthrough using 1 (and new congeners synthesised in this fellowship) as key precursors to;
(i) readily synthesised cationic diboranes that are strong electrophiles able to activate small molecules and sigma bonds (C-H) and to diborylate pi nucleophiles; 
(ii) extended homocatenated boron compounds containing both electron precise B-B and B=B bonds. 
Advances in (i) will generate new transition metal free routes to diborylated hydrocarbons for use as synthetic intermediates. Whilst the demonstration of H-H and C-H activation will demonstrate that individual steps are viable for future application using diboranes in catalytic sigma bond transformations. Advances in (ii) will generate fundamentally new boron entities, e.g., electron precise B4 chains containing B-B and B=B bonds. The chemistry of electron precise boranes is in its infancy but dramatic differences in reactivity to the isoelectronic hydrocarbons have already been reported. Precursor 1 is carefully designed to prevent borane cluster formation on reductive coupling thus facilitate formation of homo-catenated chains.",False
"Title: EXHAUSTION - Exposure to heat and air pollution in EUrope – cardiopulmonary impacts and benefits of mitigation and adaptation Abstract: Extreme heat and wildland fires are identified as key climate risks in Europe. The two risks are interlinked, as the risk of wildland fires increases during periods of extreme heat and decreasing precipitation. Extreme heat increases the death and disease rates for cardiopulmonary disease (CPD). Wildland fires cause intense air pollution in the form of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3). These are the two major air pollutants threatening human health in Europe, and their main health effects are related to CPD. Episodes of extreme temperatures and extreme levels of PM2.5 and O3 are likely to occur simultaneously and could occur more often, last longer, and become more intense in a warming world. 

EXHAUSTION will establish exposure projections for extreme heat and air pollution based on the most updated and advanced climate modeling efforts. EXHAUSTION has access to unique retrospective health registries on CPD mortality and morbidity in Northern, Central, and Southern European settings. In addition, EXHAUSTION draws upon a large time-series data base in a multi-country observational study. These data enable us to derive novel exposure-response relationships for heat, air pollution, and CPD. By combining the exposure projections and the exposure-response relationships, EXHAUSTION quantifies the future exacerbation of CPD in European settings and attributes the change in CPD mortality to a changing climate. 

EXHAUSTION will develop innovative adaptation strategies informed by epidemiological evidence, and address major inequity issues by identifying how age, sex, and indicators of socio-economic status (SES) predict probability for CPD caused by extreme heat and air pollution. EXHAUSTION will model socio-economic cost estimates for the response in CPD, and identify and validate possible adaptation strategies. Cost estimates, including projected health co-benefits of future adaptive measures and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures will be established.",False
"Title: MOOD - MOnitoring Outbreak events for Disease surveillance in a data science context Abstract: The detection of infectious disease emergence relies on reporting cases, i.e. indicator-based surveillance (IBS). This method lacks sensitivity, due to non or delayed reporting of cases. In a changing environment due to climate change, animal and human mobility, population growth and urbanization, there is an increased risk of emergence of new and exotic pathogens, which may pass undetected with IBS. Hence, the need to detect signals of disease emergence using informal, multiple sources, i.e. event-based surveillance (EBS). The MOOD project aims at harness the data mining and analytical techniques to the big data originating from multiple sources to improve detection, monitoring, and assessment of emerging diseases in Europe. To this end, MOOD will establish a framework and visualisation platform allowing real-time analysis and interpretation of epidemiological and genetic data in combination with environmental and socio-economic covariates in an integrated inter-sectorial, interdisciplinary, One health approach:
1)Data mining methods for collecting and combining heterogeneous Big data, 
2)A network of disease experts to define drivers of disease emergence,
3)Data analysis methods applied to the Big data to model disease emergence and spread,  
4)Ready-to-use online platform destined to end users, i.e. national and international human and veterinary public health organizations, tailored to their needs, complimented with capacity building and network of disease experts to facilitate risk assessment of detected signals. 
MOOD output will be designed and developed with end users to assure their routine use during and beyond MOOD. They will be tested and fine-tuned on air-borne, vector-borne, water-borne model diseases, including anti-microbial resistance. Extensive consultations with end users, studies into the barriers to data sharing, dissemination and training activities and studies on the cost-effectiveness of MOOD output will support future sustainable user uptake",False
"Title: CaMILLET - Application of crop genetics to improve Calcium content in millets and other crops for promoting health benefits in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis Abstract: With osteoporosis becoming an increasing threat to human health, this project is directed towards finding an inexpensive solution to this problem using crop genetics. Biofortification of human diet with food that are naturally rich in Calcium (Ca) is proposed. Among all cultivated cereals, finger millet (Eleusine coracana), an annual small millet of Africa and Asia, has been found to have the highest concentration of Ca (350mg/100g) in its grains. This proposal aims to investigate the genetic variations of Ca accumulation in finger millet germplasm using chemical phenotyping and genomics, and to use this knowledge in further improving the concentration of this micronutrient in finger millet and other staple crops. Specific objectives of the study are: (1) to explore the extent of genetic diversity for Ca content present in world collection of finger millet germplasms; (2) to identify genomic regions associated with Ca accumulation in finger millet grains using next generation sequencing, chemical phenotyping and GWAS analysis; (3) to identify and validate candidate genes underlying genomic regions found to be associated with Ca accumulation in finger millet; and (4) use comparative genomics to identify similar genes and processes in staple cereals like wheat, rice, barley or oats grown in Europe. The project will identify genes involved in Ca accumulation in crops and the prospects of their breeding into new varieties through plant breeding. Such crop varieties will benefit the smallholder farmers who will grow them (by adding value to their food products) and also provide valuable, superior raw material to industries for developing functional food rich in Calcium. Availabilities of such food and food products will increase Ca consumption and reduce the health and economic impacts of osteoporosis.",False
"Title: B5G-OPEN - Beyond 5G – OPtical nEtwork coNtinuum Abstract: B5G-OPEN targets the design, prototyping and demonstration of a novel end-to-end integrated packet-optical transport architecture based on MultiBand (MB) optical transmission and switching networks. MB expands the available capacity of optical fibres, by enabling transmission within S, E, and O bands, in addition to commercial C and/or C+L bands, which translates into a potential 10x capacity increase and low-latency for services beyond 5G. 
To realize multiband networks, technology advances are required, both in data, control and management planes. Concerning devices, these include new amplifiers, filterless subsystems, add/drop multiplexers, etc. Such technology advances complement novel packet-optical white boxes using flexible sliceable Bandwidth Variable Transceivers and novel pluggable optics. The availability of MB transmission will also lead to a complete redesign of the end-to-end architecture, removing boundaries between network domains and reducing electronic intermediate terminations. 
The control plane will be extended to support multiband elements and a ‘domain-less’ network architecture. It will rely on physical layer abstraction, new impairment modelling, and pervasive telemetry data collection to feed AI/ML algorithms that will lead to a Zero-Touch networking paradigm including a full featured node operating system for packet-optical whiteboxes. 
The results will be shown in two final demonstrations exposing the project benefits from operator and user perspectives. B5G-OPEN will have a clear impact on the society showing the evolution towards a world with increased needs of connectivity and higher capacity in support of new B5G services and new traffic patterns. 
The consortium includes partners from 8 countries: three major telecom operators, three vendors, four SMEs and four research centres and academia, combining several years of experience and a successful record in past European projects on related technologies, thus guaranteeing its success.",True
"Title: SpiraStent - DEVELOPMENT OF A SPIRAL LAMINAR FLOW INDUCING ENDOVASCULAR STENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE Abstract: The project is focused the medical device sector and specifically peripheral vascular (PV) devices. A large, unmet, and growing patient population will require treatment for Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and revenue in this market will continue to grow driven by the aging population and the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the most widely used non-surgical treatment, however when used in areas of long calcified stenosis, PTA does not show satisfactory results at long term follow up. Stenting has become the most obvious choice to overcome the limitations of PTA. Unfortunately, long term performance of stents appears to be problematic as they do not prevent (and may to a certain extent even cause) a failure mode known as restenosis. Whilst covered stents have tackled the problem of restenosis within the stent the stent itself interrupts the bloods natural spiral laminar flow (SLF) and increases laterally directed forces and wall shear stress downstream of the implantation causing downstream disease progression. Re-institution of the bloods SLF reduces the forces and turbulence caused by stenting, and reduces neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) distal to the stent which can lead to occlusion distal to the stent.

The global objective of the project is to develop an innovative endovascular stent that will reintroduce the natural spiral laminar flow both through the stent and distal to the stent that can be manufactured to be deployed using standard delivery system profiles. With the long term post project target of increasing patency rates to greater than 80% and reduce restenosis of the stent by greater than 20% and distal stenosis by greater than 20% at 2 year follow up. 

As a result of the proposed project, we expect to improve our collective competitiveness and generate increased sales by capturing at least €25M p.a. of the European market for endovascular stents",False
"Title: MSMART - Margination of Microcapsules in Small Arteries Abstract: Intravascular delivery of microcapsules is emerging as a novel and effective approach in targeted therapeutic and diagnostic procedures in cancer and cardiovascular diseases. It encapsulates drugs or imaging-contrast agents and functionalizes the surface of the capsule to target specific diseased sites. However, a major challenge in its applications is to improve the adhesion efficiency of capsules to the endothelium (a monolayer of cells that lines the luminal surface of blood vessels) under complex blood flow conditions. While extensive research has focused on identifying disease-associated biomolecules on the endothelium, or suitable antibody/peptides targeting these molecules, much less attention has been given to the margination of the drug carriers from the blood stream to the vascular wall, especially in arteries where many diseases develop. Margination represents the crucial first step before adhesion. The aim of this project is therefore to investigate the cross-sectional migration of microcapsules in arterial blood flows and to develop scientific understanding of how the size, shape and deformability of capsules, as well as system parameters such as the blood haematocrit, blood flow inertia and pulsatility, and vessel geometry affect the margination of the microcapsules. The project will unit the state-of-the-art in-vitro, ex-vivo experimentation and numerical modeling resolving blood flow at a cellular level. A second aim of the project is to develop practical principles for designing microcapsules with optimum margination property in arteries. The project will pave the way for novel designs of injectable medicines or imaging-contrast agents with enhanced vascular targeting efficiency.",False

The prototypes to improve policy design efficiency and coherence (PDEC) within each of the European countries, and in the European Union as a whole, will be realised through understanding the decision-making function relationships between companies and policy makers. The approach will employ questionnaires to policy makers, which have designed past incentives towards internationalization; and firms, which have used these same incentives. The insights gained will be used to generate models to explain the behaviour of both managers and policy makers in their actions and to arrive at set of principles of action for PEC. The work plan will be executed at the University of Leeds at a time when there is an EU policy (Lisbon Treaty) highlights the need of coordination of policies, the coherence in external relations, and the consistency with the potential complementarities between trade and FDI within EU members and considering third countries.

"Title: DENTALkeys - Evolution of human tooth enamel: unlocking hidden cell mechanisms Abstract: Understanding the ways in which we relate to our fossil ancestors is fundamental to elucidating how modern humans evolved. Yet, after a century of investigations, there is still no consensus about relationships among some members of the genus Homo. Studies of enamel thickness have been at the centre of these debates. Teeth preserve well in the fossil record and enamel thickness is a trait that can contribute to taxonomic classification. Yet, we know very little about the cell mechanisms that generate variation in enamel thickness. Several of our fossil ancestors have enamel that is of similar thickness, though it formed with very different underlying developmental processes. The goal in this interdisciplinary project is to combine 3D and 2D microtomography, histology, and theoretical biology to identify links between enamel growth and thickness to reveal novel traits in our fossil ancestors that will contribute new classification knowledge to our understanding of human evolution. I will examine modern day samples and fossil samples spanning the past 2 million years from the genus Homo. I will use the knowledge I gain to re-examine existing debates about which fossils are, or are not, ‘human-like’ to provide novel insights into their classification. Results will be of interest to anthropologists, human biologists, archaeologists, as well as the general public.

"Title: G MOTIT - Galileo-Enhanced MOTIT: an electric scooter sharing service for sustainable urban mobility Abstract: Causing peaks in pollution, wasted time and noise nuisance, traffic jams are one of the greatest challenges to overcome for the majority of large cities around the world. It’s a problem that affects the richest countries and developing countries alike, and the possible solutions are as slow to put in place as they are difficult to enforce. Moreover, the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. These facts highlight the need of efficient and environmentally sustainable urban mobility services that do not generate CO2 emissions and ease traffic congestion. 
Within this context, an innovative service has been developed in order to solve mobility problems in the city of Barcelona and potentially major metropolitan areas in Europe. MOTIT is a unique and innovative electric scooter sharing service, in which users may pick up and drop off vehicles wherever and whenever they want. MOTIT allows users to reserve a scooter with their smartphone, and some minutes before the start of the trip he receives a notification on his smartphone with the position of the vehicle assigned. 
Vehicle positioning performance is key for the success of the service, since the user is informed on where to pick up his vehicle based on this source. During initial pilot operations, supported by European Commission R&D funding , GPS-based solution (embedded on the tablet device of the vehicle) has proven not to be a reliable solution because of:
• Lack of availability in certain areas of the city (deep urban)
• Positioning errors, and therefore misleading scooter location information to user
Therefore, G-MOTIT project aims to overcome these problems by developing and integrating an EGNSS-based location technology. The location solution will be validated both functionally and operationally through a small-scale demonstration in Grand Paris region.",True
"Title: MICROBAT - Wireless devices for smart energy management systems Abstract: There is a growing need for smart energy-efficient homes, offices and industrial plants, and this need is increasingly being supported by legislation.  Hence there is a growing market for technologies to enable this, through the deployment of smart metering as well as intelligent heating, ventilation, lighting, and monitoring control systems.  To address this market, a new class of low-power wireless protocols has been developed for the automation and control of the above systems.
To date, wireless home and building automation systems that employ such protocols have seen limited adoption, despite the technology being widely available, mainly because conventional semiconductor radio architectures are unable to fulfill the market need of whole-house coverage and ultra-low power consumption while using inexpensive semiconductor technology.  
Cascoda's patented technology is unique in that it delivers standards-based radio communication with whole-house coverage, high data-link reliability and ultra-low power consumption, while using inexpensive CMOS semiconductor technology.
The objective of this project is to investigate the best fit for Cascoda’s technology with manufacturers energy management systems, and to develop an appropriate customer evaluation kit and a high-level protocol stack for the target application.  Together, these items will form a solution with which such manufacturers can quickly and easily integrate Cascoda’s technology.",True
"Title: EU-TOPIA - EU-TOPIA: TOWARDS IMPROVED SCREENING FOR BREAST, CERVICAL AND COLORECTAL CANCER IN ALL OF EUROPE Abstract: Breast, colorectal and cervical cancer cause 250,000 deaths each year, representing 20% of EU-cancer mortality. Although important progress has been made in both detection and treatment, there is persisting inequity in progress to reduce its burden. Screening programmes vary substantially between countries and in most long-term effectiveness of screening has not yet been assessed. The objective of EU-TOPIA is to systematically evaluate and quantify the harms and benefits of the running programmes for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in all European countries, and identify ways to improve health outcomes and equity for citizens. We will first identify significant inequities in screening outcomes by assessing the key set of quality indicators for benefits and harms in each country. Using these indicators, outcomes and cost-effectiveness of existing cancer screening programmes in 2015 will be estimated. For this, state-of-the-art models of the natural history of the cancers will be constructed, using country-specific data with and from country-specific experts. Barriers hindering implementation of optimal screening programs will be assessed, leading to road maps for  improved screening. These road maps contain feasible changes, e.g., to extend or reduce the program, to change the screen test used or change key quality indicators, to perform activities that reduce screen-related harm or incorporate new developments in screening, and provide policymakers with evidence for increased, decreased or optimized use of screening. Capacity for self-evaluation of screening will be built using three web-based tools (monitoring, model-quantification and barrier assessment) explained and trained in workshops with country representatives, also from the Associated Countries. The project will lead to reduced inequity, reduced number of cancer deaths and over-diagnosed cases, and increase in life years gained and better cost-effectiveness by 2025.

"Title: TEQ - Testing the Large-Scale Limit of Quantum Mechanics Abstract: Microscopic systems can be prepared in quantum configurations with no classical counterpart. Such a possibility seems precluded when the 'complexity' of the system grows towards the macroscopic domain: so far we have no evidence of non-classical behavior of the macroscopic world. Why is it so? How is quantumness lost as we abandon the microscopic domain? These questions, which remain to date largely unanswered, address interesting and challenging goals of modern research in physics, and serve the overarching goal of this project. TEQ will establish the large-scale limit of quantum mechanics by pursuing a novel research programme that aims at surpassing the current approach based on matter-wave interferometry. Specifically, the TEQ Consortium will
1) Trap an ad hoc manufactured nanocrystal in a radio-frequency ion trap, cooling it by optical parametric feedback, so as to let it operate in ultra-low noise environments. 
2) Determine quantitatively all the major sources of decoherence affecting the nanocrystal, and control them experimentally so as to prepare high-quality quantum states of its motional degrees of freedom. 
3) Analyse the light scattered by the nanocrystal to test the quantum predictions for the motion of the particle against those of spontaneous collapse and non-standard decoherence mechanisms, and thus pinpoint/rule-out key quantum-spoiling effects, beyond all the studies performed so far.
This roadmap will enable the test of quantum effects for systems whose mass is orders of magnitude larger than that employed in the most successful quantum experiments to date, thus closing the gap with the macroscopic world. Moreover, it will entail significant technological impact: the device that will be built will exhibit exquisite sensitivity to frequency and displacements, thus embodying a significant contribution of explicit technological nature to the design of quantum empowered metrological sensors.",True
"Title: A-LITHIA - Plastic nanoscale electronics via novel fabrication paradigms Abstract: Nanogap electrodes have been a highly attractive research area for over 25 years. This is mainly due to their potential for realising next generation nanodevices and circuit elements with lower power consumption, faster speed, and higher level of integration, as well as investigating the fundamental properties of materials at the nano- or even molecular level. However, the lack of a facile, inexpensive, high throughput technique for the manufacturing of dissimilar nanogap electrodes has hindered their commercial and scientific exploitation.
It is exactly at this junction that I strive to make significant advances with this proposal, by first implementing a novel patterning technique, adhesion lithography (a-Lith), to manufacture large aspect ratio (>100,000) metal electrode nanogaps (<50 nm) on a variety of substrates and then by fabricating and fully characterising nanoscale devices that will allow both understanding of the relevant device physics, alongside, advancing in device performance. 
Herein, I will firstly further develop the a-Lith key processing steps in order to establish a reliable protocol for the controlled geometry and uniform nanogap formation. Then I will follow a multidisciplinary research trajectory aiming at the development of high performance co-planar nano-scale electronic devices. Targeted proof-of-concept applications include radio frequency rectifying Schottky diodes, non-volatile ferroelectric tunnel junction memories, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, piezoelectric nanogenerators and molecular nano-junctions, the architectures and dimensions of which would be difficult or far too expensive to obtain with traditional patterning techniques (e.g. e-beam lithography). Finally, during my secondment, I will pursue the successful demonstration of fully functional non-volatile ferroelectric tunnel memory array over large area flexible substrates that will pave the way to the industrial deployment of this highly promising technology.",True
"Title: GMGalaxies - Understanding the diversity of galaxy morphology in the era of large spectroscopic surveys Abstract: Galaxies are the building blocks of structure in the Universe; this proposal seeks to understand how their shapes, colours and dynamics are determined. For example, what happened in the history of some galaxies to transform them into passive ellipticals while others, seemingly of the same mass and in the same environment, are star-forming spirals? Even such a basic question about the link between morphology and star formation has not yet been answered, revealing our theories of galaxy formation are inadequate. This is a major concern in an era where understanding the shapes of galaxies and how they relate to the underlying dark matter is essential for progress in precision cosmology.  

This project will build the missing link between the history of a galaxy and its observational properties (i.e. between cause and effect) by using numerical simulations.  Current research in this area rightly gives significant attention to the crucial problem of how feedback – energy input from supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and more – affect observable properties.  But as well as investigating this avenue, GM Galaxies will uniquely make use of my new technique (“genetic modification”) to systematically investigate the role of the galaxy’s merging and accretion history at high resolution.

To distinguish the fingerprints of history from the effects of feedback, we will compare to rich new data from integral field unit surveys; these reveal, for example, galactic metallicity and velocity maps. My pilot study for this project shows that such measures of a galaxy disambiguate between alternative formation routes to galaxies which would appear similar by photometric measures alone. Similarly, we will make predictions for the observable properties of the gas reservoir surrounding galaxies and for integral field observations at high redshift. In this way we will make a predictive account of how galactic structure is determined by the interaction of the accretion history with feedback.",False
"Title: Beauty2Charm - Precision tests of the Standard Model using Beauty to Charm decays Abstract: The present matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe cannot be explained by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. I propose to look for the presence of new physics beyond the SM in Charge-Parity (CP) asymmetries using beauty mesons decaying to charmed mesons (Beauty2Charm). A unique feature of these decays is that the SM contribution can be precisely measured using relations between ten decay modes all of which can be measured with in a coherent manner at a single experiment: LHCb at the Large Hadron Collier (LHC). The proposal will make measurements of ten branching ratios and eight analyses sensitive to CP violation using data collected by LHCb in order to test these relations. CP asymmetries larger than a few percent would be an unambiguous signal of the presence of new physics. In order to make these measurements at the required level of precision, I will lead a major upgrade to the way that the LHCb experiment selects proton proton collisions and for which I have laid the conceptual foundations. Real-Time Analysis  will enable a dramatic increase in the the efficiency and signal yield of the decay modes relevant to this proposal, and reduce systematic uncertainties. To test and commission this upgrade I will lead the first ever measurements of beauty hadron production using final states without leptons. The experience gained in the commissioning phase will result in increased efficiencies for the CP sensitive channels leading to the world's most precise measurements and world-leading sensitivity to new physics.",False
"Title: INTAC - The International Register of Academic Job Categories. Facilitating Careers in the European Research Area Abstract: The Proof of Concept INTAC project will create a prototype of an online Register which systematically lists, explains and compares formal job categories and status positions of research- and teaching staff in 575 higher education institutions in France, Germany and Great Britain. It will set up the Register on a public multilingual platform and provide resources for career-relevant decision-making (such as career guidelines, CV templates, visualisation and mapping tools for career tracks and status systems, identifier of job equivalents, a community forum). While international academic mobility is growing at high rates and academic systems are rapidly changing, job-seekers as well as recruiting institutions often grapple with the fact that job and status categories in academic institutions (such as PRAG, Akademische Rätin or Teaching Fellow) are difficult to understand for those coming from other institutions or systems. As a consequence, academics may not recognize the most suitable career paths and academic institutions may not receive the best applications. Responding to a demand from academics, employers, unions, associations and organisations in the higher education sector, the INTAC Register aims to facilitate academic recruitments, make national and international academic job markets more transparent and help academic career planning in the European Research Area. In order to bring the Register to the market, INTAC will create a diversified revenue stream, including regular premium user fees and licensing to academic social media. Future sponsors from the public sector will be invited to commission more institutions, countries and service functions to be included into the Register.

"Title: OPTEMUS - Optimised Energy Management and Use Abstract: Optimised energy management and use (OPTEMUS) represents an opportunity for overcoming one of the biggest barriers towards large scale adoption of electric and plug-in hybrid cars: range limitation due to limited storage capacity of electric batteries.

"Title: VirtuWind - Virtual and programmable industrial network prototype deployed in operational Wind park Abstract: With anticipated exponential growth of connected devices, future networks require an open solutions architecture facilitated by standards and a strong ecosystem. Such devices need an easy interface to the connected network to request the kind of communication service characterized by guarantees about bandwidth, delay, jitter, packet loss or redundancy. In response, the network should grant the requested network resources automatically and program the intermediate networking devices based on device profile and privileges. Similar requirement also comes from business applications where application itself asks for particular network resources based on its needs.

"Title: OptiDrill - Optimisation of Geothermal Drilling Operation with Machine Learning Abstract: Geothermal drilling industry faces various challenges such as poor overall drilling confidence and performance, and lack of bottom hole awareness resulting in NPT, tripping time etc. OPTIDRILL concept was born to address and solve problems in drilling for geothermal resources that increases uncertainty and well construction costs. OPTIDRILL ´s innovative drilling advisory system is based on a combination of enhanced monitoring systems, multiple data-driven ML modules, each being responsible for either analysis, prediction, or optimization of one aspect of drilling or completion process.
OPTIDRILL consortium, brings together highly experienced drillers, drilling project managers, engineers and operators, each having a different, yet complementary set of expertise in differing geological conditions, operating parameters and production end-goals. They will be providing data from various wells around the world.
An enhanced monitoring system will be developed based on real time MWD systems as well as acoustic and vibration sensors. The automated machine learning analysis method will predict drilling parameters, using a real-time monitoring and optimization tool, as a unified system combining existing data and the newly developed methods, and finally, a coupled drilling optimization models to reduce overall geothermal drilling and production cost.
The goal is to advise and support drilling operators in making informed decisions through real-time data, reducing many of uncertainties associated with drilling, which in term leads to less NPT, as the drilling can be more readily optimised to maintain good ROP, borehole control and address possible drilling issues, before they could impact operation. The OPTIDRILL Advisory System is NOT an attempt to just fully automate drill rig operations, but rather to enhance and digitize decision making and reporting, instrument and optimize the drilling process, and share and transfer this learning across subsequent future application.",False

"Title: SUN-PILOT - Subwavelength Nanostructure Pilot (Sun-Pilot) Abstract: Nanostructured surfaces that engineer the interaction between an object and its surroundings are a subject of scientific and manufacturing importance. Nature routinely creates nanostructured surfaces with fascinating properties, such as antireflective moth eyes, self-cleaning lotus leaves, colourful butterfly wings, and water harvesting desert beetles. Well defined nanostructured surfaces have huge commercial potential due to product enhancement: reduced reflectivity in photonic devices and solar panels, antiglare plastic parts for the automotive industry, hydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces for smart packaging, antireflective and smudge-free smartphone displays, and biofouling resistant marine and water treatment systems. Unfortunately, the lack of cost-effective, scalable, nanopatterning methods is a major hurdle for the commercial exploitation of nanopatterned surfaces. SUN-PILOT will address this challenge by developing a novel and cost effective platform for up-scaling sub-wavelength nanostructures fabrication techniques that can be applied to curved surfaces such as optical lenses, and the mass production of metal moulds for injection moulding of plastic parts.

Still, the current Internet can only evolve adequately, if its infrastructure can be devised to accommodate the emerging services. The increased cost of adding new infrastructure and capacity has a drastic effect on rural and remote communities as well as nomadic users as they become marginalized by not gaining access to crucial Internet services. Our goal is to make the Future Internet universally pervasive supporting a diverse set of services. To achieve this, we develop a universal mobile-centric and opportunistic communications architecture, which integrates the principles of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) and Information Centric Networking (ICN) in a common framework. We utilize the benefits of both ICN and DTN to enable resource exploitation at minimal bandwidth, opportunistic access to information and more localized access to information through novel caching strategies. UMOBILE focuses on assisting users in getting access to the content they want or content that may be of shared interest to their trust circles. By relying on an instance of the UMOBILE architecture, users are able to share information directly with other peers without relying on infrastructure or expensive connectivity services. The proposed architecture targets the mobile part of the networks, extends Internet connectivity to regions that are not typically covered enhancing network resilience and is fully backward compatible with the current Internet architecture.

"Title: DEEPVOLC - Forecasting volcanic activity using deep learning Abstract: DEEPVOLC will radically advance the way future activity is forecast at volcanoes by applying advances in artificial intelligence to transformative new geodetic datasets. 200 million people live within 30 km of a volcano. Accurate forecasting of volcanic eruptions is problematic because 1) it relies on human interpretation at individual volcanoes, 2) a volcano can behave in unexpected ways not previously seen at that location, and 3) most volcanoes are not instrumented. DEEPVOLC will address this by i) applying artificial intelligence, ii) using data for all volcanoes worldwide, and iii) exploiting advances in satellite monitoring. A key indicator of potential volcanic activity is deformation of a volcano's surface due to magma migrating beneath. Surface movements as small as a few millimetres can now be measured from space, using satellite-borne radar. A recently-launched European satellite mission, Sentinel-1, has transformed our ability to measure surface deformation at all of the world's volcanoes, acquiring data at least twice every twelve days. However, forecasting how deforming volcanoes will behave in the future remains challenging. In this project I will apply recently developed deep learning approaches to the satellite data. This is an entirely new approach to forecasting volcanic activity, which currently relies on the individual expertise available at each observatory, and which is only now made possible due to the launch of Sentinel-1 and advances in deep learning algorithms. DEEPVOLC will combine knowledge from all volcanoes that have been active in the era of satellite deformation observations, and will continue to improve as it ingests data from new activity. The main deliverable will be a system for volcano observatories that uses knowledge of how volcanoes behave globally to automatically identify deformation at volcanoes locally, and forecast how the deformation will evolve, indicating the probability of eruption.",True
"Title: POPREBEL - Populist rebellion against modernity in 21st-century Eastern Europe: neo-traditionalism and neo-feudalism Abstract: POPREBEL is an inter-disciplinary consortium of researchers focused on explaining and contextualising the recent rise of populism in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). While populism is a phenomenon that has by now emerged in almost every democracy, we believe that regional and cultural-historical dimensions need to be considered in order to improve not only scholarly knowledge, but also policy recommendations. It is urgent for Western Europeans to look into the CEE mirror, just as it is urgent for the CEE region to understand itself. To this end, we will create a typology of populism’s various manifestations, reconstruct trajectories of its growth and decline, investigate its causes, interpret its meanings, diagnose its consequences, and propose policy solutions.

Our focus is on CEE, but we engage in comparisons with populisms elsewhere, particularly Western Europe. While scholars from different disciplines have looked at populism, we argue that the full potential of interdisciplinary research has not been achieved yet. We draw on data and models from various disciplines and combine them into a rich study of forces at play. In addition to established methods of economics, sociology, and cultural studies, at the heart of our approach is a novel methodology whose essence is a large-scale, Europe-wide, multi-lingual online conversation. This is a listening exercise; its aim is a deep understanding of everyday life in Europe challenged by the rise of populism. The method to process this unique ethnographic material is semantic social network analysis.

POPREBEL relies on foresight/future studies, deep involvement with activists, policy makers, and civil society actors to boost the immune system of European democracy. We develop scenarios and share them with all interested parties to reflect, in public debate, on how well they fit both in the CEE region and the rest of Europe. Our focus is not just scholarly; the project serves as a platform for mutual learning.",False
"Title: DiSCo MRI SFN - Developing Integrated Susceptibility and Conductivity MRI for Next Generation Structural and Functional Neuroimaging Abstract: MRI is indispensable in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. These are poorly understood while their prevalence and socio-economic burden continue to rise. Structural and functional MRI can provide biomarkers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic intervention. My research vision is to develop novel MRI methods for structural and functional mapping of tissue magnetic susceptibility and electrical conductivity as these show great promise for neuroimaging in diseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD).

Susceptibility mapping (SM), which I pioneered, is uniquely sensitive to tissue composition including iron content affected in AD while conductivity mapping (CM) probably reflects cellular disruption in AD. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) reveals how AD affects brain networks without any tasks or stimulation equipment. However, each technique currently needs a separate time-consuming MRI scan. I will develop an integrated scan for simultaneous structural SM and CM, and rsfMRI functional connectivity characterisation. This efficient scan, ideal for AD patients, will reveal totally new resting-state networks based on electromagnetic properties: resting-state functional SM and resting-state functional CM for the first time. As changes in blood susceptibility underlie fMRI, rsfSM should measure functional connectivity more directly. This also makes it sensitive to physiological noise so I will develop noise removal methods building on fMRI techniques I established. Initial fSM studies have been at 7 Tesla but I will target the more widespread 3T field to maximise applicability. As a leader in both SM and rsfMRI physiological noise removal I have the ideal background to integrate SM and CM with fMRI and extend them for ground-breaking functional electromagnetic connectivity. This research will yield a rich set of novel, multimodal MRI contrasts to allow development of new combined structural and functional biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and other diseases.",False

"Title: BINGO - Breeding Invertebrates for Next Generation BioControl (BINGO) Abstract: BACKGROUND
Secure and sustainable food production in terms of quantity and quality is a major challenge facing human societies. However, food security is continuously threatened by current and invasive pest species. EU regulations for the use of pesticides are getting stricter to ensure food safety and protect ecosystem health. Biocontrol of agricultural pests by using natural enemies has great potential to deal with these two demands.
CHALLENGE
Controlling novel exotic pests often involves importing non-native natural enemies. Such practices are undesirable as it poses risks to local biodiversity. Optimizing existing and native biocontrol agents can reduce the dependence on imported natural enemies.
OBJECTIVE
BINGO will advance current knowledge in biocontrol practice through the use of natural genetic variation and by simultaneously training 13 young researchers in an extensive suite of interdisciplinary skills. This will allow them to improve the efficiency of biological pest control through selective breeding of natural enemies in a broad range of agricultural systems and environmental conditions.
HOW
The research projects will address current bottlenecks in biocontrol, for rearing, monitoring and performance, that include a broad range of scientific disciplines and in which state-of-the-art population genomics will be applied. Industry has a pivotal role by providing the problems for research, training, and by translating the results to capacity building and increased competitiveness.
RELEVANCE
BINGO will deliver improved biocontrol agents, knowledge on the genetic organisation of traits related to agents’ performance, genetic markers for monitoring and risk assessment, and guidelines and protocols for genetic improvement of natural enemies. Crucially, BINGO will deliver eager ESRs that have the potential to thrive in professional environments in science, industry and public bodies to ensure that the biocontrol potential is met and implemented.",False
"Title: ENCOUNTER - Demography, Cultural change, and the Diffusion of Rice and Millet during the Jomon-Yayoi transition in prehistoric Japan Abstract: Human history is punctuated by episodes of large-scale diffusion of new ideas and people that lead to era-defining transitions in past societies. Investigating what promotes these events, how societies react to these, and what are their long-term consequences is a key to understand the fundamental drivers of cultural change. ENCOUNTER will push forward this research agenda by investigating the Jomon-Yayoi transition, a demic and cultural diffusion event that led the predominantly hunting, gathering, and fishing-based communities of the Japanese islands to adopt rice and millet farming during the 1st millennium BC. The continental migrants who triggered this transition event did not bring just a new economy, but also new technology and culture, deeply impacting the indigenous society. The transition was however not uniform, as different regions responded to the new culture in different ways. Some immediately adopted the new cultural repertoire to its full extent, others embraced only certain elements, and still others resisted for over 1,000 years, generating cultural, linguistic and genetic clines that are still tangible today. ENCOUNTER will investigate this pivotal moment in Japanese prehistory, seeking to determine why the indigenous inhabitants responded so differently to the arrival of the new culture. It will examine the dynamics of this transition by: synthesising one of the richest archaeological records available in the world; combining new and old lines of evidence across different disciplines, including organic chemistry, palynology, and material culture studies; and developing a suite of computational techniques to reconstruct patterns of demographic change and cultural diffusion. It will question the existing narrative that farming is inevitable and instead put new emphasis on the incumbent hunter-gatherer populations to understand their motivations to change subsistence strategies with respect to their environment settings and cultural affinities.",False
"Title: WASPSNEST - Wavelength tunable Advanced Single Photon Sources Non-laboratory Environment Specification and Testing Abstract: Triggered single photon sources are key enabling tools in the new technology of quantum communications and a host of quantum optics research, but have not found widespread use because robust and portable devices have yet to be commercialised. The FP7 WASPS project is completing laboratory-based demonstrator experiments for a new range of plug-in single photon sources that can ultimately be operated at ambient temperatures and in non-laboratory environments. The devices, based on nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond coupled to optical microcavities, offer a degree of wavelength tunability and a flexible design in which the active component can be replaced and upgraded. Work towards construction of a field-testable prototype device has started. In this Innovation Launchpad project, we propose to carry out critical steps in the development and field testing of this prototype that will provide key performance information to companies looking to manufacture and market the technology. These will involve innovative refinement of the active module containing the cavity and single photon emitter, development of module assembly protocols compatible with manufacturing, and testing of the prototype in a free-space quantum key distribution system. The project will bring robust triggered single photon sources closer to market and will promote innovation and entrepreneurship within the H2020 FET programme.",True
"Title: RAPID-MIX - Realtime Adaptive Prototyping for Industrial Design of Multimodal Interactive eXpressive technology Abstract: RAPID-MIX brings together 3 leading research institutions with 4 dynamic creative industries SMEs and 1 leading wearable technology SME in a technology transfer consortium to bring to market innovative interface products for music, gaming, and e-Health applications.
RAPID-MIX uses an intensely user-centric development process to gauge industry pull and end-user desire for new modes of interaction that integrate physiological human sensing, gesture and body language, and smart information analysis and adaptation. Physiological biosignals (EEG, EMG) are used in multimodal hardware configurations with motion sensors and haptic actuators. Advanced machine learning software adapts to expressive human variation, allowing fluid interaction and personalized experience.
An iterative, rapid development cycle of hardware prototyping, software development, and application integration accelerates the availability of advanced interface technologies to industry partners. An equally user-centric evaluation phase assures market validation and end-user relevance and usability, feeding back to subsequent design cycles and informing ultimate market deployment.
The RAPID-MIX consortium leverages contemporary dissemination channels such as crowd funding, industry trade shows, and contributions to the DIY community to raise awareness across the professional and consumer landscapes of novel interface technologies.
Project output is encapsulated in an Open Source RAPID-API exposing application level access to software libraries, hardware designs, and middleware layers. This will enable creative partner SMEs to build a new range of products called Multimodal Interactive eXpressive systems (MIX). It also allows broader industries such as quantified self, and DIY communities, to use the API in their own products in cost effective ways. This assures the legacy of RAPID-MIX and marks its contribution to European competitiveness in rapidly evolving markets for embodied interaction technologies.",True
"Title: NanoBioCar - Impacts of Nanoparticles on microphytobenthic Biofilms and consequences on the Carbon cycle Abstract: Intertidal and shallow subtidal zones are key areas for biochemical transformations, and particularly they play a crucial zone in the carbon cycle. In soft-bottom areas, most primary production is performed by photosynthetic microorganisms organised in biofilms, and called microphytobenthos. The organic matter they produce is rapidly respired by bacteria or consumed by higher trophic levels. Together, microphytobenthos and bacteria realise most carbon transformation in these areas, and are therefore important groups to study in a view to understand carbon cycling in coastal zones. Coastal areas are currently under influence of numerous stressors linked to anthropogenic effects. The impacts of ‘well established’ pollutants, e.g. metals, oils, nitrogen, are fairly well understood; however there is now evidence that new compounds, products of advanced technology, have the potential to disrupt the environment. The aim of this project is to understand how a recently developed family of compounds, namely nanoparticles (NPs), influences the development of biofilms and their impact on the carbon cycle. NP concentrations are increasing dramatically in the environment, but their effect on organisms and ecosystems is currently poorly described. Yet, genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of NPs have been demonstrated, including on microorganisms. In this project, laboratory and field experiments will be performed to characterise the effects of NPs on microphytobenthos and bacteria, on their trophic interactions and on their roles in carbon and nutrient cycles. Two common types of NPs will be tested in a wide range of environmental conditions, to decipher in which conditions NPs are more or less harmful to organisms and processes. Such understanding will allow developing strategies to reduce the impacts of NPs and will be beneficial to environment and human well-being in EU and elsewhere.",False
"Title: NetZeroCities - Accelerating cities' transition to net zero emissions by 2030 Abstract: NetZeroCities (NZC) is designed to pursue the ambition of the report from the Mission Board for Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, as part of a broader European ambition to achieve climate neutrality before 2050. This ambition represents a substantial elevation of the degrees of decarbonisation and the timescale for achieving it. For all cities achieving this level of impact is an extraordinary undertaking and would require profound changes in how policies, projects and programmes are advanced by cities, with the direction and support of senior governments. NZC connects and builds beyond established programmes and experimental initiatives.
The NetZeroCities consortium is build based on partners? expertise, experience, and access to a very large network of cities of all sizes and maturity throughout Europe. It has an excellent balance of partner typologies, a great geographical coverage allowing presence and activity all throughout Europe, and thanks to that, its approach goes beyond current state-of-the-art.
NetZeroCities will create a programme tailored to the specific conditions of each city. All the services and thematic expertise will be aggregated and co-designed through a NZC one-stop-shop Platform and the digital portal and smart repository for impact measurement, capacity building and knowledge/tools dissemination. Cities will benefit from an intensive support relationship of dedicated City Guides to navigate the platform and ensure city needs are adequately understood and addressed. 
NetZeroCities will support pilots in 30 European cities and, in subsequent rounds of engagement, more than 100 cities to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 (medium-term) and 2050 (long term) respectively, by developing and deploying an integral approach to support climate-neutral transformation in cities. This will be achieved through the co-design and organisation of services, including the Climate-neutral City Contract as an enabling instrument.",False
"Title: Levitate - Levitation with localised tactile and audio feedback for mid-air interactions Abstract: ""This project will be the first to create, prototype and evaluate a radically new human-computer interaction paradigm that
empowers the unadorned user to reach into levitating matter, see it, feel it, manipulate it and hear it. Our users can interact
with the system in a walk-up-and-use manner without any user instrumentation.

As we are moving away from keyboards and mice to touch and touchless interactions, ironically, the main limit is the lack of
any physicality and co-located feedback. In this project, we propose a highly novel vision of bringing the physical interface to
the user in mid-air. In our vision, the computer can control the existence, form, and appearance of complex levitating objects
composed of """"levitating atoms"""". Users can reach into the levitating matter, feel it, manipulate it, and hear how they deform it
with all feedback originating from the levitating object's position in mid-air, as it would with objects in real life. This will
completely change how people use technology as it will be the first time that they can interact with technology in the same
way they would with real objects in their natural environment.

We will draw on our understanding of acoustics to implement all of the components in a radically new approach. In particular,
we will draw on ultrasound beam-forming and manipulation techniques to create acoustic forces that can levitate particles
and to provide directional audio cues. By using a phased array of ultrasound transducers, the team will create levitating
objects that can be individually controlled and at the same time create tactile feedback when the user manipulates these
levitating objects. We will then demonstrate that the levitating atoms can each become sound sources through the use of
parametric audio with our ultrasound array serving as the carrier of the audible sound. We will visually project onto the objects to create a rich multimodal display floating in space.""",True

"Title: ChainReact - Making Supplier Networks Transparent, Understandable and Responsive Abstract: ChainReact is an effort to make supplier networks transparent, understandable, and responsive, so that companies and their stakeholders can see, react to, and ultimately transform corporate network impacts.  To this end, we will create an integrated data network supported by three platform struts:
1. A new informer platform (TalkFree) will help advocacy groups manage campaigns to solicit flexible bottom-up reports about corporate behaviour.
2. The world’s largest open repository of corporate information (OpenCorporates) will be enhanced to connect these reports to major corporate brands through multi-level corporate network mapping.
3. An open analysis platform (WikiRate.org) will integrate data from both sources (and others, including direct corporate disclosure) and support their interpretation via collaboratively-developed dynamic, network-aware CSR metrics.
Network participation will be driven by outreach campaigns organized in collaboration with advocacy groups, including pilot campaigns with consortium partner Walk Free Foundation, an international non-profit with the mission to eliminate slavery, with a community of 8.5m participants in their campaigns.  Several other major not-for-profit players, including Oxfam International, the Carbon Disclosure Project, and Amnesty International, have also begun discussions around involvement in ChainReact campaigns.  
University of Cambridge and University of Warsaw will provide a research perspective on every aspect of ChainReact’s development and outreach.  CERTH is the project coordinator and brings expertise in the entity matching that will support extracting corporate network data from unstructured documents. OpenCorporates is run by consortium partner Chrinon Ltd, WikiRate.org is run by consortium partner WikiRate e.V., and a new nonprofit will be formed to run TalkFree.

It is  proposed to last 48 months to implement, as the call requests, a very ambitious restructuring of the backbone network operated by GÉANT in order to provide equal access to clouds and other e-infrastructure services in the European research area and beyond.  It will improve the overall resilience and reliability of the GÉANT network significantly and offer a base for future improvements in access, transmission speeds and capacity wherever needed.
The outcome of GN4-3N project will offer uniform network access and choice of services to many more partners, eliminating the """"digital divide"""" wherever technically and economically feasible. 
This project proposal is based on technical and economic studies carried out during 2017-2018 in the GN4-2 project which have given the Consortium clarity on the resourcing, financial and effort, needed to realise the huge ambition of this undertaking.  It exclusively covers the engineering, procurement, acquisition and installation of the new backbone network. The day-to-day network operations as the elements of it is commissioned is the responsibility of the teams described in accompanying the GN4-3 project.

"Title: IMPETUS - Pilot line for paper based electrochemical test strips dedicated to quantitative biosensing in liquids Abstract: IMPETUS will combine paper, printing and microchip technologies to realise a pilot line capable of manufacturing fully integrated paper-based electrochemical biosensors that directly transfer the measured data to the user’s smartphone. These biosensors will be designed as self-powered disposable test strips that combine the simplicity of lateral flow tests with quantitative readout, which is enabled by the implemented electrochemical detection method. As an application example, we will fulfil the consumer need for fast point-of-care discrimination between bacterial and viral infections.
In particular, IMPETUS will combine screen-, flexo- and inkjet-printing in a seamless roll-to-roll pilot line compatible to high-throughput fabrication. Here, the paper is employed as substrate for the printed circuits and a microchip, but also as active component of the printed battery as well as of the biosensor. This we will achieve by developing new technologies for paper manufacturing, coating and surface modification, and the respective processing will work hand in hand with the ink development (cellulose-based inks for fabricating the printed battery as well as bio-inks for surface functionalization and reagent deposition). A highly integrated and energy-efficient silicon microchip will be developed that enables electrochemical data acquisition, storage and contactless NFC transmission, and the microchip will be mounted onto the paper substrate by an inline placement process. 
In summary, the IMPETUS pilot line will pave the way towards the real world application of paper-based quantitative electrochemical diagnostic test strips, thereby clearly advancing the current state-of-the-art, which up to now has mostly focussed on individual fabrication processes and device concepts. The IMPETUS pilot line is conceived in such a way that during the project, all printing and assembly processes will be implemented and validated.",True
"Title: Revolution - Regulation and Evolution of C4 photosynthesis Abstract: Life is dependent on sugars made during photosynthesis. When plants colonized land ~450 million years ago they used a photosynthetic system known as the C3 pathway that still operates in the majority of species today. However, from ~30 million years ago over sixty plant lineages evolved a version of photosynthesis known as the C4 pathway that increases CO2 fixation efficiency by about 50%. C4 species such as maize and sorghum are now the most productive on the planet and achieve this by compartmentalizing gene expression between cell-types.

As with other complex biological systems made up of multiple distinct cell-types, it has not been possible to understand how photosynthesis genes are regulated in specific cell-types of C4 leaves. In contrast to strategies being used by other groups, I propose to discover how specific cell-types of ancestral C3 leaves regulate gene expression, and then to use this information to determine how C4 photosynthesis operates. To achieve this, state-of-the-art approaches used on whole tissues will be adapted to study individual cell-types.

Revolution will test the hypothesis that cell-specific gene expression in C4 leaves is mediated by pre-existing regulatory networks found in C3 species. Intracellular mechanisms regulating photosynthesis genes in ancestral C3 but also derived C4 leaves will be identified. In C3 leaves I wish to understand how some cell-types express photosynthesis genes whilst others remain photosynthetically repressed. In C4 leaves I wish to discover the extent to which cell-specific expression is based upon pre-existing regulatory networks in the C3 leaf.

Revolution will therefore generate information of broad relevance to understanding gene expression in eukaryotes, and provide insight into mechanisms underpinning one of the major evolutionary transitions since plants moved to land.",False
"Title: UBioRec - Development and Testing of a Reference Computational Platform for Understanding Biomolecular Recognition Abstract: Due to its fundamental regulatory role, molecular recognition has been extensively studied by both experiments and
simulations. During the last 30 years impressive technical advances allowed significant progress in understanding molecular
recognition mechanisms. However, the matter is far from settled and contradictory reports are still appearing in the literature.
Lately, I have been studying these processes using a combination of computational and experimental approaches in
different systems. Here I propose to study several representative model systems in great details, taking advantages of new force fields, DFT functionals and enhanced sampling algorithms recently emerged. These systems are small enough to allow the use of state-of-the-art simulation techniques; still they are sufficiently complex not only to mimic the behaviour of far larger systems but also to use apparently different mechanisms. Indeed, their molecular recognition needs complex conformational changes, the re-arrangement
of water molecules in the binding cavity, and an active role of the ligand in the binding/release mechanisms. The overarching
objective of my proposal is to learn the state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques developed at UCL and combine them
with QM/MM approaches to: i) understand how bio-molecular recognition works in both isoforms, ii) fully characterize the
thermodynamics and kinetic processes that govern them and iii) validate the computational approaches against high-quality
experimental data. If successful, the in-depth understanding of the molecular binding mechanism will shed light on an
intriguing and important biological system and provide a much needed benchmark to the computational community. This
challenging but feasible project will have a far reaching impact on a number of H2020 priority areas, including drug discovery

"Title: EvoGamesPlus - Evolutionary games and population dynamics: from theory to applications Abstract: Evolutionary game theory (EGT) was developed to model biological populations, and the early models had great success in explaining apparently paradoxical biological behaviour. Animal and human populations are complex, however, involving important factors such as social relationships, space and time. Thus whilst EGT is a great tool to conceptualize and understand real-world biological interactions, standard EGT is often too simplistic and therefore insufficient to describe the interactions at hand with a sufficient level of realism.
There has thus been a lot of work in developing more realistic models of populations, including by participants in this project, and this is a rapidly growing area. There is a great shortage of, and need for, highly trained and versatile researchers comfortable with the mixture of mathematical modeling, biological knowledge and expertise in computing and the analysis of data. It is rare for undergraduates to be taught all of these skills, and so a significant training focus is needed at PhD level. The development of a strong group of such researchers is at the centre of this proposal, and we have developed a training plan to give them the required expertise in the relevant areas, and their combination.
We will pursue 4 research themes, 2 developing methodology and 2 focused on applications. The first concerns the modelling of structured populations, incorporating more realistic spatial and social interactions. The second considers important out of equilibrium dynamical concepts, often neglected in favour of equilibria. The third focuses on the mathematical modelling of cancer and its treatment. Here the two above concepts are especially important. The fourth considers ecological and epidemiological modelling where the focus is on structural complexity relating to the interplay of different timescales and the management and analysis of epidemiological data. Whilst specialising, all ESRs will gain knowledge of all of these important themes.",False
"Title: SAPTiMeC - Semi-Autonomous ProtoTissues capable of photo-Mechano-Chemical transduction Abstract: Recently, researchers in the field of bottom-up synthetic biology have developed different models of non-living cell-like entities, termed protocells. Protocells are designed to mimic basic aspects of living cells and have potential applications in various emerging technologies. Prototissues comprise networks of protocell consortia that communicate and display synergistic functions. Though the current designs contribute much to the development of bottom-up synthetic biology, they lack robustness and the complexity required to perform higher-order functions. The aim of this proposal is to advance the prototissue design to create prototissues capable of higher-order functions (i.e. photo-mechano-chemical transduction). The prototissues will be created by stratifying and patterning populations of specialised protocells. As a result, the prototissue will be able to self-regulate the amount of luminous energy received from the environment by opening and closing cyclically. This movement enables the prototissue to tune its endogenous photocatalytic reactivity, producing waves of an output chemical signal. The expertise of the applicant in photochemistry, materials and nanomaterials chemistry will be applied to the emerging field of prototissue engineering, area in which the hosting supervisor is an emerging leader. The approach will be focussed on the generation of macroscopic free-standing prototissue sheets with complex architectures. This process will be used to create phototropic prototissues upon exploiting photoresponsive hydrogels encapsulated in their building blocks. The resulting phototropic prototissues will be modified in order to contain building blocks with photocatalytic synthetic proto-organelles. Collectively, the outcome of this proposal will: kickstart a new area of bottom-up synthetic biology; provide a new approach to the construction of out-of-equilibrium systems; and deliver new materials with applications in tissue engineering and soft robotics.",False

"Title: MiroMigration - Miro dependent mitochondrial dynamics and the regulation of neuronal migration Abstract: Regulated trafficking of mitochondria is essential for providing ATP at the correct spatial location to power neural computation, and for providing Ca2+ buffering at sites of Ca2+ entry or release. In neurons, the concentration of mitochondria in specific regions such as growth cones and synapses is important for correct neuronal function and development. Consequently, defective mitochondrial trafficking is increasingly implicated in neurological diseases. Very little is known regarding the role of mitochondrial positioning and function during neural development such as during the migration of cortical neurons. This proposal will study the mechanisms that control the trafficking of mitochondria in neurons and how this regulates neuronal migration during cortex development. Using imaging, molecular techniques, combined with ex vivo or in utero electroporation and mouse transgenic models I will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the signalling-dependent positioning of mitochondria in migrating neuronal progenitors. I will examine how the mitochondrial Ca2+-sensing GTPase Miro1 acts as a molecular switch to regulate mitochondrial positioning and function. How Miro1-mediated mitochondrial trafficking regulates neuronal migration in brain development will also be determined. A key goal will be to determine the role of Miro1 Ca2+-sensing and GTPase domains and other components of the Miro1 protein complex including CENPF, DISC1 and Nde1 in the control of mitochondrial positioning in these processes. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control mitochondrial signalling-dependent localization in regulating neuronal development. Moreover, understanding these processes may highlight novel therapeutic approaches for neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, schizophrenia and intellectual disability, where disrupted neuronal migration and cortical wiring are thought to occur.",False
"Title: WINTHER - Fast optoacoustic mesoscopy, using the skin as a window for therapeutic monitoring of local and systemic disease. Abstract: Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging dramatically improves upon conventional bio-optic barriers and enables three-dimensional, high-resolution optical imaging deep inside tissues (several mm to cm). Clinical optoacoustic macroscopy has been supported by two ERC Advanced Awards (2008, 2016; Prof. Ntziachristos). In parallel, under the ICT program INNODERM, we developed mesoscopic optoacoustic imaging for dermatology diagnostics. Termed raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM), the method can image previously invisible ❶ pathophysiological/oxygenation and ❷ morphological features of the skin at depths of 1-5mm. RSOM has already shown clinical diagnostic value in dermatology and, fuelled by INNODERM, has been commercialised and globally placed by iThera Medical. 
WINTHER builds on this success. While INNODERM focused on diagnostic dermatology, it has become apparent that RSOM can also assess progression and therapy not only in skin but also in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. However, to achieve this, RSOM should be able to assess endothelial function, ability that it is not yet available. WINTHER will build next-generation fast RSOM (F-RSOM), operating up to two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art RSOM, enabling it to assess not only ❶,❷ above but also ❸ endothelial function. Using the skin as a window for disease assessment and aided by a modern computation framework, based on deterministic and artificial intelligence algorithms, F-RSOM aims to improve the clinical accuracy of RSOM and shift the paradigm in therapeutic monitoring of cardio-metabolic diseases and inflammatory skin conditions, strengthening Europe's leadership in photonics and in personalized medicine.

"Title: MolCellTissMech - Molecular and cellular determinants of cell monolayer mechanics Abstract: Epithelial monolayers are amongst the simplest tissues in the body, yet they play fundamental roles in adult organisms where they separate the internal environment from the external environment and in development when the intrinsic forces generated by cells within the monolayer drive tissue morphogenesis. The mechanics of these simple tissues is dictated by the cytoskeletal and adhesive proteins that interface the constituent cells into a tissue-scale mechanical syncitium. Mutations in these proteins lead to diseases with fragilised epithelia. However, a quantitative understanding of how subcellular structures govern monolayer mechanics, how cells sense their mechanical environment and what mechanical forces participate in tissue morphogenesis is lacking.

To overcome these challenges, my lab devised a new technique to study the mechanics of load-bearing monolayers under well-controlled mechanical conditions while allowing imaging at subcellular, cellular and tissue resolutions. Using this instrument, my proposal aims to understand the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics as well as the cellular behaviours that drive tissue morphogenesis.  I will focus on four objectives: 1) discover the molecular determinants of monolayer mechanics, 2) characterise monolayer mechanics, 3) dissect how tension is sensed by monolayers, and 4) investigate the biophysics of individual cell behaviours participating in tissue morphogenesis.

Together these studies will enable us to understand how monolayer mechanics is affected by changes in single cell behaviour, subcellular organisation, and molecular turnover. This multi-scale characterisation of monolayer mechanics will set the stage for new theoretical descriptions of living tissues involving both molecular-scale phenomena (cytoskeletal turnover, contractility, and protein unfolding) operating on short time-scales and rearrangements due to cell-scale phenomena (cell intercalation, cell division) acting on longer times.",True
"Title: UNEXMIN - Autonomous Underwater Explorer for Flooded Mines Abstract: This project will develop a novel robotic system for the autonomous exploration and mapping of Europe’s flooded mines. The Robotic Explorer (UX-1) will use non-invasive methods for autonomous 3D mine mapping for gathering valuable geological and mineralogical information. This will open new exploration scenarios so that strategic decisions on the re-opening of Europe’s abandoned mines could be supported by actualised data that can not be obtained by any other ways. The Multi-robot Platform will represent a new technology line that is made possible by recent developments in autonomy research that allows the development of a completely new class of mine explorer service robots, capable of operating without remote control. Such robots do not exist nowadays; UX-1 will be the first of its kind. Research challenges are related to miniaturisation and adaptation of deep sea robotic technology to this new application environment and to the interpretation of geoscientific data. Work will start with component validation and simulations to understand the behavior of technology components and instruments to the application environment. This will then be followed by the construction of the first Prototype. Post processing and data analysis tools will be developed in parallel, and pre-operational trials are launched in real life conditions. In the final stage of the project extensive pilots will take place during which UX-1 will be iteratively improved after each trial session, which will be increasingly demanding. The final, most ambitious demonstration will take place in the UK with the resurveying of the entire Ecton mine (UK) that nobody has seen for over 150 years. This final pilot will demonstrate the Platform’s scalability from small missions to the largest ones by increasing the number of deployed autonomous drones, and supporting multi-robot cooperation in confined 3D spaces with realtime sensor and data fusion for reliable navigation and communications.",False
"Title: EMPOWER - EMpowering transatlantic PlatfOrms for advanced WirEless Research Abstract: EMPOWER ambitions to accelerate the joint development between the EU and the US on advanced wireless platforms targeting the new connectivity frontiers beyond 5G. EMPOWER targets the creation of a joint EU-US advanced wireless ecosystem for (i) bridging the relevant EU-US Wireless communities and stakeholders, such as scientific researchers, platform engineers, standardization experts, regulators, and product incubators; and (ii) developing a strategic EU-US collaboration agenda and supporting its execution ahead of worldwide competition for beyond 5G connectivity standards. EMPOWER foresees twinning with the best researchers and practitioners involved in projects funded by USA, especially with entities participating in the PAWR programme (https://www.advancedwireless.org/). EMPOWER will provide instruments for inducing collaboration between ongoing and forthcoming 5G and beyond initiatives targeting at wireless networks experimentation on both ends of the Atlantic. Through the EMPOWER instruments we aim to create an efficient means for stimulating the circulation of ideas and people between European and similar American experimental wireless platform initiatives. We also aim at encouraging stronger collaboration between fundamental and experimental wireless researchers by making access to platform tools and data exchange simpler. EMPOWER instruments will also provide a wealth of information for global and regional standards and regulatory organizations (e.g. ITU-R, ETSI) and industry fora (e.g. NGMN). An important additional output of EMPOWER will be in the form of recommendations on technologies and experimentation methodologies for future wireless experimentation objectives.

"Title: REVERSEACTION - Reverse engineering collective action: complex technologies in stateless societies Abstract: Cooperation is a markedly human mix of innate and learned behaviour, and a key to tackling some of our greatest concerns. Paradoxically, studies of social dynamics often focus on hierarchies, state formation and political structures ruled by coercive power, with comparatively little regard to the mechanisms whereby humans voluntarily collaborate. Encouragingly, new research on collective action is reconciling classic anthropology with game theory and empirical studies of group resource management, thus heralding a fundamental transformation.
Archaeological collective action studies have mostly concentrated on subsistence and relatively simple technologies. There is a perplexing lack of research on cooperative production of luxury items, i.e. those materialising exceptional investment in materials, skill and/or labour, and not geared towards subsistence. Evidence for goldwork, polychrome textile-making and lapidary work in stateless societies provides compelling proof that complex technologies could be sustained in the absence of coercive powers, but explanations are lacking.
How can complex technological systems be sustained in the absence of coercive political administrations? To address this question, REVERSEACTION will deploy archaeological science methods to the reverse engineering of archaeological artefacts made of multiple materials, combined with environmental studies, and fostering exploratory collaborations with anthropology, sociology, management studies and crafts.
A key focus will be placed on two stateless societies of Pre-Columbian America: Muisca and Nariño. These offer a wealth of relevant materials, including goldwork, ceramics, lithics and textiles. Incorporating technological studies, raw material sourcing, and formal analyses of skill and knowledge transmission, the data will be used to test hypotheses on the role of cross-craft interaction in ensuring resilience, and on the relationships between ritual, complex technologies, and innovations.",False
"Title: PROSPECT - PROactive Safety for PEdestrians and CyclisTs Abstract: The past decade has seen significant progress on active pedestrian safety, as a result of advances in video and radar technology. In the intelligent vehicle domain, this has recently culminated in the market introduction of first-generation active pedestrian safety systems, which can perform autonomous emergency braking (AEB-PED) in case of critical traffic situations. PROSPECT will significantly improve the effectiveness of active VRU safety systems compared to those currently on the market. This will be achieved in two complementary ways: (a) by expanded scope of VRU scenarios addressed and (b) by improved overall system performance (earlier and more robust detection of VRUs, proactive situation analysis, and fast actuators combined with new intervention strategies for collision avoidance).

PROSPECT targets five key objectives:
i. Better understanding of relevant VRU scenarios 
ii. Improved VRU sensing and situational analysis
iii. Advanced HMI and vehicle control strategies 
iv. Four vehicle demonstrators, a mobile driving simulator and a realistic bicycle dummy demonstrator
v. Testing in realistic traffic scenarios and user acceptance study

The consortium includes the majority of European OEMs (Audi, BMW, DAIMLER, TME and Volvo Cars) currently offering AEB systems for VRU. They are keen to introduce the next generation systems into the market. BOSCH and CONTI will contribute with next generation components and intervention concepts. Video algorithms will be developed by UoA and DAIMLER. Driver interaction aspects (HMI) are considered by UoN and IFSTTAR. Euro NCAP test labs (IDIADA, BAST, TNO) will define and validate test procedures and propose standardization to Euro NCAP and UN-ECE. Accident research will be performed by Chalmers, VTI and BME, based on major in-depth accident databases (GIDAS and IGLAD) and complemented by East Europe data.

"Title: MENTOR - Machine LEarning in Optical NeTwORks Abstract: Optical fiber networks is one of the major drivers of our societal progress and a key  enabler of the global telecommunication infrastructure. Optical networks underwent considerable changes over the past decade, as consequence of a continuous growth (exceeding 20% per year) of bandwidth demand.   The current growth sets strong requirements in terms of capacity and costs for the operators, which seek to decrease the cost per transmitted bit. Several solutions have been proposed, and among them wide-band is more favourable to network operators, compared to more/or novel fibers. However, wide-band optical system presents new major challenges: optical components must guarantee similar performance over a broad spectrum, network optimization is carried out on a non-flat spectrum and with a much larger number of channels making design, optimization and control a complex problem. Therefore, application of machine learning (ML) techniques is of the growing importance for high-capacity multi-band (MB) optical systems. ML is becoming the technique of choice to solve complex nonlinear technical problems, such as, advance component design and management of wide-band networks. 

The European Industrial Doctorate MENTOR presents a timely proposal to train 6 ESRs in the interdisciplinary field of high industrial importance: ML applications in multi-band optical communications. As ML can properly works only when a large amount of real data is available, it is crucial to bring together academic partners and the industry that provide access to the data. MENTOR consortium offers the strong industrial commitment of four large companies (CORIANT Germany and Portugal, ORANGE Labs and TELECOM ITALIA MOBILE) that significantly contributed in defining the research and training topics to be studied together with the world-leading academic partners in MENTOR. MENTOR will contribute to the European economy by design of the next generation of high-capacity optical networks.",True
"Title: IDentIFY - Improving Diagnosis by Fast Field-Cycling MRI Abstract: Many diseases are inadequately diagnosed, or not diagnosed early enough by current imaging methods. Examples of unmet clinical needs arise in thromboembolic disease, osteoarthritis, cancer, sarcopenia, and many more areas. Our solution, Fast Field-Cycling (FFC) MRI, can measure quantitative information that is invisible to standard MRI. FFC scanners switch magnetic field while scanning the patient, obtaining new diagnostic information. FFC-MRI has been demonstrated by us, but many challenges must be solved before clinical adoption.
Objectives:
Understand the mechanisms determining FFC signals in tissues;
Create technology to measure and correct for environmental magnetic fields, enabling FFC at ultra-low fields;
Investigate contrast agents for FFC, to increase sensitivity and to allow molecular imaging;
Improve FFC technology, in order to extend its range of clinical applications;
Test FFC-MRI on tissue samples and on patients.
Achieved by:
Developing the theory of relaxation in tissue at ultra-low fields, leading to models and biomarkers;
Developing magnetometers for FFC-MRI, and environmental-field correction;
Creating and in vitro testing of new FFC contrast agents; studying existing clinical agents for FFC-MRI sensitivity;
Improving technology to monitor and stabilise magnetic fields in FFC; improving magnet power supply stability; investigating better radiofrequency coils and acquisition pulse sequences;
Testing FFC methods on tissue samples from surgery and tissue banks; proof-of-principle scans on patients.
FFC-MRI is a paradigm-shifting technology which will generate new, quantitative disease biomarkers, directly informing and improving clinical diagnosis, treatment decisions and treatment monitoring. Its lower cost contributes to healthcare sustainability.

"Title: SONNET - Self-OrganizatioN towards reduced cost and eNergy per bit for future Emerging radio Technologies Abstract: A revelation in today´s mobile is networks is SON (Self-Organizing technology) technology, which is seen as a playing pivotal role towards reducing the management costs of networks. In legacy networks, still many network elements and associated parameters are manually configured. The associated operations costs are significant. Specialized expertise must be maintained to tune these network parameters, and the existing manual process is time-consuming and potentially error-prone. In addition, this manual tuning process inherently results in comparatively long delays in updating values in response to the often rapidly changing network topologies and operating conditions, resulting in sub-optimal network performance. SON is capable of collecting information from the network, so as to perform self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing and etc, so as to reduce the operation cost through less human involvement, and to optimize the service quality through robust and prompt network optimization.   

In this proposal, we aim to drive further cost savings in the way networks are managed today by amplifying further the coverage zone of SON within the network. We believe that key technologies such as network sharing and Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) can benefit from SON technology solutions. We will consider a complex context-aware heterogeneous network that is slowly becoming a 5G reality, and investigate the notion of SON CoMP and SO network sharing, as key technologies to reduce cost and energy per bit in legacy and future emerging mobile technologies.",True
"Title: OrganoidAlign - Comparative modelling of organoids in the age of single-cell transcriptomics Abstract: The OrganoidAlign action will develop a solid computational framework for comparative modelling of organoids in the age of single-cell transcriptomics. It will provide direct payoffs to both, tissue engineering and single-cell genomics fields. The overarching goal is to build a set of statistically rigorous and consistent probabilistic models for aligning a single-cell transcriptomic profile of an organoid against its in vivo tissue, for quantitatively evaluating its recapitulatory power. 

During the course of this action, a meticulous review will be conducted on the state-of-the-art single-cell data modelling and comparative analysis techniques prior to formulating the single-cell transcriptomic profile comparison problem in statistical learning theory. This will specifically focus on both cell clustering and cell trajectory inference methods. A new statistical framework will be implemented to accommodate a comprehensive comparison between a pair of in vitro and in vivo transcriptomic profiles. A rigorous scoring measure will be devised to quantify their alignment. 

Overall, the inference components under the proposed framework will facilitate the prediction of missing or outlying cellular attributes, transcriptional factors and signaling pathways in organoids compared to their in vivo tissues, informing directions of organoid protocol improvement. Overall, its outcomes will have potential contributions towards engineering more reliable in vitro tissue models, as well as reference profiling of organoids under the Human Cell Atlas project.",False
"Title: Methodology - A New Methodology for Comparative Analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Cognate Literature Abstract: My post-doctoral project entitled “A New Methodology for Comparative Analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Cognate Literature” will take an integrative approach to the Dead Sea Scrolls (henceforth scrolls), the New Testament and other ancient Jewish literature. It is therewith part of an ongoing and lively debate on how the scrolls can shed new light on and give meaning to texts that have puzzled New Testament scholarship all along. I intend to describe and highlight more prominently the different „evolutionary factors“ like the absence from a sacrificial cult, the focus on a unique canon of formative scriptures, the understanding of the group as a “holy building” and an “eternal planting” (1QS 11:7-9), and the impact of Greco-Roman culture that shaped the language, laws and theology of the communities behind the scrolls. My first challenge when turning to New Testament traditions will be to show how its authors transferred ideas and traditions from a Palestinian Jewish background into a new cultural milieu with an almost entirely different encyclopaedia of knowledge an act that I would call “translation of traditions”. One of the biggest difficulties in tradition-historical comparison between New Testament and Yahadic writings is to determine whether or not the traditions incorporated into New Testament writings are of Palestinian Jewish origin but phrased differently with Greek motives and expressions. Only when we know the “source language” that is the underlying concept behind these expressions we will be able to identify its tradition-historical origin. With the identification of Palestinian Jewish traditions in New Testament writings the last step that is the comparison of concepts that underlie New Testament traditions and the ideas from which Yahadic traditions originated can then be implemented.",False
"Title: CUISINE - An innovative approach for the study of culinary practices in past societies Abstract: The aim of this project is to develop an innovative methodology for the study of culinary practices (cuisine) in past societies integrating the morpho-typological analysis of cooking pots, the analysis of their lipid content and the analysis of microbotanical remains. By analysing a society's diet and cuisine we can explore, for instance, cultural development  expressed through growing complexity in parallel with the development of more complex social and technological structures. This project will explore culinary practices in past societies through the integrated analysis of phytoliths, starch grains and lipids from cooking pottery. In order to interpret the archaeological record, extensive plant reference collections and several experiments will be developed as part of the project. At the same time, the methods developed during the experimentation phase will be tested and validated on two archaeological case studies in the Aegean, an area that has historically been (and still is) a crossroad for people and foodstuffs: the Neolithic site of Stavroupoli (Greek Macedonia, ca. 5600-5000 cal. BC) and the Bronze Age site of Knossos-Gypsades (Minoan Crete, ca. 3650-1100 cal. BC). The development of these integrated analyses on Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements will allow for the study of the emergence of new social practices and cultural identities linked to the origins of food production and the development of complex, urban societies.",False
"Title: SMARTRange - A disruptive wireless transceiver chip to transform the Internet of Things (IoT) by delivering excellent range, ultra-low power, high security, high reliability and cost-effective connectivity. Abstract: Part of the 4th Industrial Revolution, the Internet of Things (IoT) represents a global growth opportunity. In particular, the IoT offers tremendous socio-economic and environmental benefits through the improved automation and energy efficiency of Smart Homes, Buildings and Industrial Plants.

Most IoT applications demand that devices provide the range of WiFi. In addition, devices must be standards-based, highly secure, globally interoperable, reliable, ultra-low power and cost effective.

However, existing IoT technology is failing to meet these market needs. Current 2.4GHz radios have limited range and sub-GHz radios do not give security or global interoperability. 

There are two ways to increase the range of radio devices: 1) increase transmit power or 2) improve the radio’s receiver sensitivity (Rx sensitivity). However, legislation in Europe limits transmit power to 10dBm, meaning the only practical way to increase range is to improve Rx sensitivity. 

Cascoda has developed a disruptive 2.4GHz wireless transceiver based on a unique patent-protected radio architecture, which significantly improves Rx sensitivity, effectively doubling the range without using any external power amplifiers. This delivers the range of WiFi to provide whole-house coverage, reduces power consumption by a factor of 6 enabling years of operation from batteries, provides high security, reliability and reduces equipment costs by a factor 5 as no power amplifiers are needed. 

Extensive R&D and market feasibility studies including a Eureka Eurostars and a H2020 Phase 1 project, have taken us this far. This Phase 2 project will allow us to optimise, refine and certify our products under industry standards and demonstrate our systems under real-world conditions. This project enables us to enter the low-power wireless market worth at least €3 billion. By 2025, we will cumulatively generate €48 million in revenues and €27 million in operating profits and help create up to 184 skilled jobs.",True
"Title: DEDICAT 6G - Dynamic coverage Extension and Distributed Intelligence for human Centric applications with assured security, privacy and trust: from 5G to 6G Abstract: In future 6G wireless networks, it is imperative to support more dynamic resourcing and connectivity to improve adaptability, performance, and trustworthiness in the presence of emerging human-centric services with heterogeneous computation needs. DEDICAT 6G aims to develop  a smart connectivity platform using artificial intelligence and blockchain techniques that will enable 6G networks to combine the existing communication infrastructure with novel distribution  of intelligence (data, computation and storage) at the edge to allow not only flexible, but also energy efficient realisation of the envisaged real-time experience. DEDICAT 6G takes the next vital step beyond 5G by addressing techniques for achieving and maintaining an efficient dynamic connectivity and intelligent placement of computation in the mobile network. In addition, the proposal targets the design and development of mechanisms for dynamic coverage extension through the exploitation of novel terminals and mobile client nodes, e.g., smart connected cars, robots and drones. DEDICAT also addresses security, privacy and trust assurance especially for mobile edge services and enablers for novel interaction between humans and digital systems.  The aim is to achieve (i) more efficient use of resources; (ii) reduction of latency, response time, and energy consumption; (iii) reduction of operational and capital expenditures; and (iv) reinforcement of security, privacy and trust. DEDICAT 6G will focus on four use cases: Smart warehousing, Enhanced experiences, Public Safety and Smart Highway. The use cases will pilot the developed solutions via simulations and demonstrations in laboratory environments, and larger field evaluations exploiting various assets and testing facilities. The results are expected to show significant improvements in terms of intelligent network load balancing and resource allocation, extended connectivity, enhanced security, privacy and trust and human-machine interactions.",True
"Title: ID-EPTRI - Infradev - European Paediatric Translational Research Infrastructure Abstract: The general objective of this project is to design the framework for the European Paediatric Translational Research Infrastructure (EPTRI), a new Research Infrastructure (RI) aimed to enhance technology-driven paediatric research in discovery and early development phases to be translated into clinical research and paediatric use of medicines.
The starting point of the proposal is the serious lack of medicines for children in EU and worldwide as well as the lack of a developmental model for paediatric medicines that integrates technology-driven aspects with the methodological, ethical and regulatory framework. The design for this new RI will be based on the following main pillars:
•	to harness efficiency and delivery of paediatric research activities and services strengthening collaboration within the scientific paediatric community;
•	to be a complementary RI in the context of the existing RIs covering the current gaps, while avoiding any duplication;
•	to develop a one-stop-shop for advice in paediatric drug development.
To prepare a valuable Conceptual Design Report (CDR), the project encompasses three phases. During the Context Analysis phase, that will be performed in 5 technical and scientific domains (1- Paediatric Medicines Discovery, 2- Paediatric Biomarkers and Biosamples, 3-Developmental Pharmacology, 4-Paediatric Medicines Formulations and Medical Devices, 5-  Underpinning Medicines Development to Paediatric Clinical Studies) the perceived value and the possible gaps to be covered will be estimated by enquiring the scientific communities and many other Stakeholders.
During the Operational phase, the different components of the new RI will be depicted including governance model strategies for interaction with national Authorities and the existing RIs, the IT-architecture model, services to be provided and a business plan.
Finally, a Feasibility phase is proposed to develop virtual exercises simulating the operations of the RI. 
The final result of the project will be the CDR to realize EPTRI.",False
"Title: CLASP - A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry Abstract: As elsewhere in Europe, Anglo-Saxon England saw a development from an oral, vernacular, native, and pagan culture to one that was primarily literate, Latinate, imported, and Christian; and such a transition is clearest in Anglo-Saxon verse. CLASP will focus on all surviving verse of Anglo-Saxon England, composed in Old English and Anglo-Latin over a period of over four centuries (c. 670–1100 CE), and produce for the first time an online and interactive consolidated library, marked up through TEI P5 XML to facilitate the identification of idiosyncratic features of sound, metre, spellings, diction, syntax, formulas, themes, and genres across the entire corpus, so forging connections and suggesting more certain chains of influence both within and between the two main literary languages of Anglo-Saxon England. The bilingual corpus comprises almost 60,000 lines of poetry, with about half surviving in each language, and mostly appearing in only a single witness, usually in manuscript. More than fifty named poets are identified, many of them dateable with more or less precision, whose influence on each other can be closely documented, while in the case of anonymous verse, most of which is in Old English, the focus will be on tracing potential influence between texts, to establish a comparative rather than an absolute chronology. CLASP will use the full panoply of digital resources, including sound- and image-files where relevant, to make the oldest surviving poetry in England available to a modern audience for unprecedented kinds of exploration, comprehensive analysis, and interrogation, and in a series of conferences, workshops, and other publications will show the potential of such a comprehensive multilingual corpus to revolutionize perspectives not only on Anglo-Saxon England, but elsewhere in Europe, where Latin and the vernacular likewise co-existed in a Christian context across centuries.",False
"Title: NonMinimalHiggs - Non Minimal Higgs Abstract: On July 4th CERN has announced the discovery of a scalar particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), later identified as the Higgs boson. This scientific breakthrough was accomplished due to the joint efforts of thousands of scientists from all around the globe. This long awaited discovery increased our understanding of the world, providing an explanation for the mechanism from which all elementary particles acquire mass. However, there are still fundamental questions awaiting a clear answer: which model better describes nature when all observed properties of this new particle are taken into consideration? Will these new models help to solve other outstanding problems in elementary particle physics? The goal of this project is to look for answers to these crucial questions regarding our understanding of nature.
In order to address the problem we have gathered a group of people with complementary expertises that range from model builders to high-energy tool developers who will finally make the connection to the LHC's experimental collaborations. We expect that this interaction between the different nodes of this international collaboration will result in a database together with high-energy tools where a number of models will be readily available for testing by the experimental groups at the LHC and future colliders.
The staff exchange will be planned according to the needs of the project. There have been collaborations in the past between some of the nodes. We now expect that the proposed staff exchange will enhance this Higgs physics network, with an effective skills development both for experienced and early stage researchers. Finally we foresee that the project will not only have an impact on European science but will also contribute to bring together different cultures with a very positive outcome for society as a whole.",False
"Title: GeoHex - Advanced material for cost-efficient and enhanced heat exchange performance for geothermal application Abstract: Heat exchangers (HXs) are the most critical components of a geothermal power plant specially for organic Rankine cycle (ORC) based plant and the capital cost of heat exchanger accounts for a large proportion of ORC, and even reaches about 86% when air cooled condenser is used. Direct heat exchangers (e.g. geothermal brine to district heating) and ORC HXs such as superheater, preheater, evaporator are in direct contact with the geothermal brine, causing scaling and corrosion at different extent based on the thermophysical condition and chemical composition of the geofluid. To handle corrosion, expensive materials are recommended, but due to lower thermal conductivity and degraded performance over time compel to increases the size of the HXs. Hence, improvements in the antiscaling and anticorrosion properties as well as heat transfer performance of the HX material will lead to smaller, more efficient and less costly systems.

GeoHex will rely on the use low cost carbon steel as base material for HX. Through modifying the surface with nano porous coating and controlling the surface chemistry (along with the surface structure), GeoHex will significantly improve the heat transfer performance of single phase and phase change heat transfer process respectively. To attribute the antiscaling and anticorrosion properties, the brine side of the surface will be Ni-P/Ni-P-PTFE duplex coated by electroless method.

GeoHex will significantly reduce the cost of ORC plant while lowering the environmental impact. The technology concept can be exploited to build cost efficient HXs for solar thermal energy, heat pumps, absorption chiller, geothermal energy-based district heating cooling system. GeoHex enabled ORC plant, heat pumps and absorption chiller can be used for waste heat recovery application. Hence, GeoHex will significantly contribute to enhance the energy security, decarbonise the economy, establish the EU leadership on renewables.",False
"Title: Target-N2O - Targeting N2O emission hot-spots in dairy pastures for mitigation action: microbes, stable isotope methods and modelling Abstract: Nitrogen (N) limits primary productivity in most terrestrial ecosystems, which has led to increased use of N fertilisers within farming systems. The amount of reactive N in global circulation has more than doubled; this has global significance as the N can cascade through different chemical forms in land, air and water, leading to a range of human health and environmental impacts. In order to achieve sustainable food production systems of the future, there is a need to improve knowledge on the best management of farm N, especially under increased demand for food production under a burgeoning human population. The Target-N2O project will deliver a high quality training-through research project aiming to improve N use efficiency and reduce emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas, N2O, from intensive dairy farms. The project will combine multi-disciplinary techniques in a novel way, including molecular ecology, stable isotope methods and whole-farm system modelling to determine the cost-benefits of an N loss mitigation strategy. The strategy would be to apply nitrification inhibitors to pasture areas which have been identified as farm-scale N2O emission hot-spots (e.g. areas of pasture around gateways, livestock shelter areas and camping areas). Such areas receive regular inputs of nutrients including labile N (through urine events) and carbon sources (via dung), which fuel microbial processes leading to enhanced and spatially variable GHG emissions. Evidence of the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitors to reduce N losses from these areas are lacking. The results of the action will have cross-sectoral impact (scientists, dairy and fertiliser industries and policy makers). The project will deliver decision support tools for farmers utilising such a mitigation strategy and will impact policy by improving national GHG inventories, establishing the effectiveness of cost-effective mitigation strategies.",False
"Title: CARESSES - Culture Aware Robots and Environmental Sensor Systems for Elderly Support Abstract: The groundbreaking objective of CARESSES is to build culturally competent care robots, able to autonomously re-configure their way of acting and speaking, when offering a service, to match the culture, customs and etiquette of the person they are assisting. By designing robots that are more sensitive to the user’s needs, CARESSES’ innovative solution will offer elderly clients a safe, reliable and intuitive system to foster their independence and autonomy, with a greater impact on quality of life, a reduced caregiver burden, and an improved efficiency and efficacy. 

The need for cultural competence has been deeply investigated in the Nursing literature. However, it has been totally neglected in Robotics. CARESSES stems from the consideration that cultural competence is crucial for care robots as it is for human caregivers. From the user’s perspective, a culturally appropriate behavior is key to improve acceptability; from the commercial perspective, it will open new avenues for marketing robots across different countries. 

CARESSES will adopt the following approach. First, we will study how to represent cultural models, how to use these models in sensing, planning and acting, and how to acquire them. Second, we will consider three (physically identical) replicas of a commercial robot on the market and integrate cultural models into them, by making them culturally competent. Third, we will test the three robots, customized for three different cultures, in the EU (two cultural groups) and Japan (one cultural group), on a number of elderly volunteers and their informal caregivers. Evaluation will be conducted through quantitative and qualitative investigation.

To achieve its groundbreaking objective, CARESSES will involve a multidisciplinary team of EU and Japanese researchers with a background in Transcultural Nursing, AI, Robotics, Testing and evaluations of health-care technology, a worldwide leading company in Robotics and a network of Nursing care homes.",True
"Title: IntelliGen - Advanced control platform for next generation Free Piston Engines (FPEs) for clean and efficient power generation Abstract: Clean and efficient Free Piston Engines (FPEs) offer numerous advantages over traditional ICE architectures. Despite some high-profile attempts (Volvo, General Motors, Toyota), FPEs have not yet realised large scale commercial applications as it is very challenging to control the motion of the piston sufficiently. This is a substantial engineering challenge requiring multiple control operations to be performed repeatedly in a millisecond timescale to combat piston drift. There is a need for a flexible platform technology that enables FPEs to address the large range of potential use-cases, and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. IntelliGen is a ground-breaking platform technology for precise control of Free Piston Engines (FPEs), an emerging class of ICEs, which enables higher fuel efficiency, ultra-low emissions, and reduction in the operating cost of power. Furthermore, FPEs are compatible with low carbon and renewable fuels. Due to inherent problems with controlling the variable motion of the piston, commercial FPE development programmes had stalled, until now. IntelliGen enables precise control of piston motion and allows FPE architectures to be designed and scaled to suit any application including automotive and mobile power generation. The revolutionary platform unlocks the vast potential residing in FPEs, paving the way for the next 4 billion engines and a cleaner, more sustainable future. During the phase 1 feasibility study, Libertine will establish a sound go-to-market strategy and supply chain, and will outline further development plans. In the second phase of the innovation project, Libertine will optimise the platform, test and deploy a miniaturised FPE for automotive application, demonstrate medium volume production and obtain certification.",True
"Title: MATISSE - Post-crisis urban transformations in Athens and Barcelona; a comparative approach Abstract: Nearly a decade after its outbreak, the shockwaves of the 2008 global crisis remain omnipresent in Southern Europe. Rapid political, economic and institutional transformations have triggered the reshuffling of housing. Within this framework, transnational investors are entering local property markets, purchasing repossessed houses and/ or non-performing loans. Spain and Greece, and their major cities Barcelona and Athens, are two outstanding but contrasting examples of this socio-political and spatial restructuring. They provide crucial theoretical, methodological and analytical challenges for urban studies and a key opportunity for the development of a novel comparative-relational approach to learn about the local consequences of the strategies of these global actors. The project MATISSE will address three lines of inquiry, looking into: (i) which are the policies encouraging housing financialisation (ii) who are the transnational investors and; (iii) which are the social and spatial implications of such property restructuring. It will bring together an interdisciplinary approach based on a two-way knowledge transfer between the ER’s (Dr Georgia Alexandri) existing research in urban restructuring in Spain and Greece with the Supervisor’s (Dr Stuart Hodkinson) extensive experience and research expertise in housing financialisation, privatisation and corporate mapping.",False
"Title: EVOIMMECH - The evolutionary ecology of bacterial immune mechanisms Abstract: Bacteria have a range of immune mechanisms, but it is unclear why this diverse armamentarium evolved. The most important immune mechanisms are (1) Surface Modification (SM) (2) Abortive infection (Abi) (3) Restriction Modification (R-M) (4) CRISPR-Cas and (5) prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo), all of which can occur as stand-alone mechanisms or in combination. The individual mechanisms differ in key aspects, such as their fitness costs (constitutive versus inducible), specificity (indiscriminate versus specific), the recipient of the benefits (individual versus group), the speed of de novo resistance evolution (rapid versus slow), and heritability of immunity. Here I will take a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to tease apart the variables that drive the evolution of these diverse stand-alone and integrated bacterial immune strategies in nature, and examine their associated co-evolutionary dynamics. I focus on three ecological variables that are consistently important in host-symbiont co-evolution: (1) force of infection (2) spatial structure (3) presence of mutualists (plasmids). First, I will perform in vitro manipulations using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 variants that carry either single or multiple immune mechanisms. Next, I will sequence metagenomes, transcriptomes and viromes of microbial communities from environments that differ in ecological variables that are important in vitro, to examine their importance in vivo. Key ecological mechanisms identified in the first two parts of the project will be used to guide mesocosm experiments to experimentally confirm that these mechanisms are the drivers of the observed patterns of resistance and co-evolution in nature. Finally, I will share my data with mathematical biologists to generate theoretical models to predict and manipulate the evolution of bacterial immune mechanisms, which will facilitate tailored species protection in agriculture and industry.   ",False
"Title: DeFInE - Defining strategic financial governance of innovation: institutional context(s) and strategic capabilities of State-Investment Banks in the EU. Abstract: Development Finance Institutions in Europe (DeFInE) is a multidisciplinary research project that aims at developing an institutional conceptual framework for development finance institutions or state-investment banks (SIBs) in the European Union and analyzing their strategic competences that are directly linked to their policy roles. SIBs are increasingly recognized as strategic agents of change in providing scarce long-term resources to risky projects that commercial financial sector is either unable or unwilling to finance. Following an emerging discussion over ‘Entrepreneurial State’ and the need to make financing an integral part of innovation policies, SIBs should be considered as an active element of financial governance of innovation and development. Despite a large number of currently existing SIBs, their analysis has been mostly focused on policy objectives, financial instruments and corporate governance. However, not all SIBs have been successful in playing strategic policy roles. Reasons are complex: lack of strategic industrial policies, or changes in policy objectives, political interference, changes in sources of funds and corporate strategies, but also, and more importantly, lack or change of internal strategic competences. The project combines evolutionary economics perspective (dynamic capabilities), economics of innovation (financing of innovation) and public governance perspective (policy capacity, bureaucracy) in order to analyse institutional contexts and internal capacities of SIBs. In doing so, the aim of the project is to better understand what makes some SIBs strategic state-backed investors in financing innovation-led growth while others – less so. The context of multinational governance of the EU adds another unique dimension to the study. European Commission has already expressed the vision to more actively engage National Promotional Finance Institutions in Member States in the next budgetary period 2021-2027.",False

"Title: SMARTFISH - Smart fisheries technologies for an efficient, compliant and environmentally friendly fishing sector Abstract: The objective of SMARTFISH is to develop, test and promote a suite of high-tech systems for the EU fishing sector, to optimize resource efficiency, to improve automatic data collection for fish stock assessment, to provide evidence of compliance with fishery regulations and to reduce ecological impact. SMARTFISH exploits technological developments in machine vision, camera technology, data processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data analysis, smartphones/tablets, LED technology, acoustics and ROV technology to build systems for monitoring, analyzing and improving processes for all facets of the fishing sector, from extraction, to assessment, to monitoring and control. The SMARTFISH systems will:
- assist fishermen in making informed decisions during pre-catch, catching, and post-catch phases of the extraction process. This improves catch efficiencies and compositions in fisheries across the EU, leading to improved economic efficiency while reducing unintended fish mortality, unnecessary fishing pressure and ecosystem damage.
- provide new data for stock assessment from commercial fishing and improve the quality and quantity of data that comes from traditional assessment surveys. This provides more accurate assessment of currently assessed stocks and allow the assessment of data-poor stocks.
- permit the automatic collection of catch data to ensure compliance with fisheries management regulations. 
The SMARTFISH systems are tested and demonstrated in several EU fisheries. This contributes to promoting the uptake of the systems by extraction sector and fisheries agencies. An interdisciplinary consortium with technology developers and instrument suppliers, fishing companies, research and fisheries management institutes and universities will realize SMARTFISH. They are active at national and international levels and well placed to ensure the uptake of SMARTFISH systems by fishing industry and fisheries managers and stock assessment scientists.",True

"Title: ICN2020 - ICN2020: Advancing ICN towards real-world deployment through research, innovative applications, and global scale experimentation Abstract: Information access on the Internet is exploding. Usage is shifting to multimedia applications, social networking and IoE. Cellular networks are moving to the next generation. Networking technology is shifting towards virtualization, with SDN and NFV likely to change the infrastructure landscape. The cloud concept is transforming the Internet to a network of data centers, with a communication model consisting of computer-to-cloud-to-computer interactions. Security concerns are leading to an encryption of all traffic, wreaking havoc with established network mechanisms.

In this scenario with dramatic growth and evolution, where abstractions and interfaces become fundamental, ICN is just the perfect solution. ICN2020 will build on the wealth of studies performed on ICN with six main aims: a) design and develop a set of innovative applications such as video delivery, interactive videos and social networks to exploit ICN; b) augment ICN with IoT features and cloud/CDN/virtualization services; c) accordingly enhance existing ICN solutions/architectures; d) build local and global test-bed(s) to experiment the applications, services and ICN enhancements; e) contribute to common APIs and standards, by continuing the work that project partners are already doing; and f) Industry POCs of products and services exploiting ICN.

The ICN2020 consortium includes leading experts in ICN and contributors to ICN testbeds in EU, Japan and USA, thus making the goal of federating them a credible one. Partners are also coordinators of running projects on 5G and Cloud topics, allowing fruitful cooperation with fellow projects of the EU-JP1, EU-JP2 calls and increasing the overall expected impact of the EU-Japan cooperation. In a time when 5G networks are being designed, with foreseen unprecedented flexibility due to the virtualization and slice concepts, the development of compelling demonstrations of ICN for real-world use-cases will encourage critical industry investment of resources.",True
"Title: 3D-Forensics/FTI - Mobile high-resolution 3D-Scanner and 3D data analysis for forensic evidence fast track to innovation Abstract: Crime is a major factor in reducing the level of civil security. The percentage of solved crime is less than 70% in more than half of the EU countries in some it is less than 50%. A very important part of crime investigation is the capturing and analysis of forensic evidence. In High Volume Crimes, such as burglary, a common trace type are footwear and tyre track traces. At present the recording and analysis of such traces can only be mitigated (if at all) through time consuming procedures. In the last years the FP7 project 3D-Forensics (www.3D-Forensics.eu) developed and evaluated a promising approach to fill gaps in the performance of actual tools. Footwear and tyre traces are captured using modern optical 3D-scanning technology and investigated using a 3D analysis software focussed on forensic end users. The project culminated in the demonstration of the system prototype outdoors under the same conditions of those typically found at crime scenes by the Dutch police from the region of Zeeland West-Brabant.
3D-Forensics / FTI will bridge the so called “valley of death” between a successful research and technological development and market introduction of innovation. It will finish off the footwear and tyre trace 3D scanning and analysis idea from an already advanced project output to make it market mature and ready for launch. In essence 3D-Forensics / FTI will implement the last steps identified as necessary at the end of the previous FP7 project. The resulting advanced prototypes will be tested, including in “round robin”  tests by six forensic end users for performance verification and in a further phase the prototypes from a pilot line with the same or very similar specifications as the first product to be launched will be validated in a relevant accredited process. Communication with the forensic community together with the feedback from the testing and validation exercises will enable our business model to be fine-tuned and validated.",False
"Title: 5G-MoNArch - 5G Mobile Network Architecture for diverse services, use cases, and applications in 5G and beyond Abstract: Motivation: The expected diversity of services and use cases in 5G requires a flexible, adaptable, and programmable architecture. While the design of such an architecture has been addressed by 5G-PPP Phase 1 at a conceptual level, it must be brought into practice in Phase 2. To this end, 5G-MoNArch will (i) evolve 5G-PPP Phase 1 concepts to a fully-fledged architecture, (ii) develop prototype implementations and (iii) apply these prototypes to representative use cases.

Approach: 5G-MoNArch architecture design will combine Phase 1 concepts (such as virtualisation, slicing and orchestration of access and core functions) with three enabling innovations that fill gaps not ad-dressed in Phase 1: (i) inter-slice control and cross-domain management, to enable the coordination across slices and domains, (ii) experiment-driven optimization, to leverage experimental results to design highly performing algorithms, and (iii) cloud-enabled protocol stack, to gain flexibility in the orchestration of virtualised functions.

Testbeds: The devised architecture will be deployed in two testbeds: (i) the sea port, representative of a vertical industry use case, and (ii) the touristic city, representative of a mobile operator deployment. For each testbed, 5G-MoNArch will instantiate the architecture and complement it with a use case specific functionality – the two functional innovations of 5G-MoNArch: (i) resilience and security, needed to meet the sea port requirements, and (ii) resource elasticity, to make an efficient use of the resources in the touristic city. 

Impact: 5G-MoNArch has a very high potential for commercial impact, including enhanced products (e.g., orchestrators or edge-cloud RAN), novel services (enabled by network slicing) and opportunities for new market players. To exploit this potential, 5G-MoNArch has elaborated a thorough and realistic innovation plan that includes patents and standards.",True
"Title: PATRIMONiT - PATRIMONiT. From Cheap Print to Rare Ephemera: 16th-Century Italian 'Popular' Books at the British Library Abstract: Large quantities of 16th-Century Italian ‘popular’ books – the books read or ‘listened to’ by everyone during the Early Modern Period, printed with poor quality material and having usually a short life expectancy –, sometime after the 16th century found their way to the UK to join the largest single collection of Italian 16th-century books in the world, that is the British Library (BL). This library preserves today a substantial number of early Italian editions which do not survive in any Italian library and are still not adequately recorded.
The objectives of the PATRIMONiT project are both bibliographical and historical: 1) to survey all the 16th Italian ‘popular’ books now at the BL which do not survive in any Italian library; 2) to define new rules for cataloguing 16th ‘popular’ books and catalogue approx. 250 items in the PATRIMONiT database, entering the data in EDIT16 and in the CERL Thesaurus; 3) to study the edition history of these books using archival sources, that is to examine the historical circumstances related to their survival and international circulation with a new methodology.
Carnelos proposes to demonstrate that this ephemeral material is really important in reconstructing the socio-cultural history of a country. Specifically, her aim is to understand when and why ‘popular’ books underwent a change in their perceived value, from books to be used and reused to books that were considered at once disposable and worthy of collection, and how time and space, politics and cultural policies influenced this change. 
Supported by three centres of excellence (the Consortium of European Research Libraries or CERL, the BL and the Istituto Centrale per il catalogo unico delle biblioteche italiane e per le informazioni bibliografiche or ICCU), the PATRIMONiT project combines the more recent developments in three main disciplines (Library Science, History and ICT), to tackle historical questions which cannot be approached and successfully solved individually.",False
"Title: STARCELL - Advanced strategies for substitution of critical raw materials in photovoltaics Abstract: STARCELL proposes the substitution of CRM’s in thin film PV by the development and demonstration of a cost effective solution based on kesterite CZTS (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) materials. Kesterites are only formed by elements abundant in the earth crust with low toxicity offering a secure supply chain and minimizing recycling costs and risks, and are compatible with massive sustainable deployment of electricity production at TeraWatt levels. Optimisation of the kesterite bulk properties together with redesign and optimization of the device interfaces and the cell architecture will be developed for the achievement of a challenging increase in the device efficiency up to 18% at cell level and targeting 16% efficiency at mini-module level, in line with the efficiency targets established at the SET Plan for 2020. These efficiencies will allow initiating the transfer of kesterite based processes to pre-industrial stages. These innovations will give to STARCELL the opportunity to demonstrate CRM free thin film PV devices with manufacturing costs ≤ 0.30 €/Wp, making first detailed studies on the stability and durability of the kesterite devices under accelerated test analysis conditions and developing suitable recycling processes for efficient re-use of material waste. The project will join for the first time the 3 leading research teams that have achieved the highest efficiencies for kesterite in Europe (EMPA, IMRA and IREC) together with the group of the world record holder David Mitzi (Duke University) and NREL (a reference research centre in renewable energies worldwide) in USA, and AIST (the most renewed Japanese research centre in Energy and Environment) in Japan. These groups have during the last years specialised in different aspects of the solar cell optimisation and build the forefront of kesterite research.

"Title: ImmunAID - Immunome project consortium for AutoInflammatory Disorders Abstract: Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAID) encompass several rare disorders characterised by extensive clinical and biological inflammation. SAID are caused by the dysregulation of the innate immune system. Due to numerous and unspecific symptoms, tentative diagnosis often leads to failure/delay and inadequate treatments. ImmunAID will deliver a method for rapid and accurate diagnosis across all the spectrum of SAID, in order to improve clinical management of SAID patients. Thanks to parallel analyses run on samples from more than 600 patients with monogenic or undiagnosed SAID collected throughout Europe, Immunaid will generate a unique and comprehensive set of data, based on unbiased multiomics approaches (gene, transcript, protein, microbiome), and hypothesis-driven assays exploring inflammasome, inflammation resolution and immune networks. A centralised data management strategy will enable to conduct integrated analyses for diagnostic biomarker identification. In a discovery phase, semi-supervised clustering of omics data will be combined to supervised analysis of pathway-related data to provide robust classification and strong link to clinical features/impact. The related biomarkers will further be validated externally on independent samples and cohorts. Overall, ImmunAID will disentangle the spectrum of SAID, and propose a new omics- and pathogenesis-based SAID classification associated to a clinical decision making algorithm implementable in daily practice. An efficient dissemination plan will target e.g. guideline-forming bodies, the medical community and patients with the help of the ERN RITA and with the objective of turning our results into clinical practice.

"Title: EVNSMAS - An evolutionary approach to automated norm synthesis for multi agent systems Abstract: The field of multi-agent systems (MAS) is concerned with the theory, design, and implementation of systems of semi-autonomous software agents that operate in an environment, and typically have conflicting goals. A key issue in such domains is that of coordination: how to design agents to minimise any potential negative aspects of their interactions, and to maximise any potential positive aspects. A key approach to coordination is that of normative systems. A normative system defines constraints on the behaviour of agents to coordinate their interactions. This research programme is at the intersection of normative systems design and evolutionary game theory (EGT). EGT studies how evolutionary forces can lead populations to game theoretic solutions, and has been useful in understanding, for example the distributions of populations of species in habitats. The hypotheses of this project are that (1) EGT can provide a useful mathematical framework to model and understand normative systems in MAS; and (2) EGT techniques can provide a powerful framework to engineer normative systems for MAS. Thus, norm synthesis will consist of an evolutionary process in which most successful norms will prosper, while unsuccessful norms will be naturally discarded. The tools used to understand such norms will be solution concepts from EGT - notably the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy. In this project we will develop both frameworks for understanding EGT for normative systems design and to synthesise normative systems for MAS, and we will empirically investigate our techniques in the context of two application domains. To carry out this project the fellow will be trained in classical game theory and EGT. To this aim he will benefit from supervision of Prof Michael Wooldridge, and collaboration with his research group in Oxford. This project will develop science and will contribute to the development of the fellow's career plan to become an independent researcher.",False

"Title: UTOUCH - Universal mid-air haptic feedback Abstract: Ultrahaptics is the first and only company in the world to create a novel haptic feedback system that allows users to feel sensations in their bare hands while interacting in mid-air with a touchless sensing system. We use an array of ultrasonic speakers to create mid-air feeling without touching. Invisible forces are projected into the air and felt on human skin up to 1 metre away from the device. The activities planned in our project will allow us to create three routes to market – the bespoke solutions, the development kits (Dev Kit) and business-to-business (B2B) products. Within this project we will expand and actively pursue the Dev Kit and B2B route, where we will make development platforms and completed products available to companies that want to integrate Ultrahaptics in their applications. In the Dev Kit route, we will create embedded Ultrahaptic systems based on standard microprocessors that are offered with development boards (WP4) and software tools (WP3). This will allow a large range of small and medium enterprise companies to write their own applications without needing to go through our evaluation programme. In the B2B route, we will create simple ubiquitous modules such as touchless buttons with tactile feedback. To enable us to target a wide range of markets, we will pursue the Dev Kit and B2B route for 3 sizes of firmware - U5 which is closest to what we already have in-house in terms of processing speed and number of transducers required, U7 which maximises performance and features and U3 which is a low-cost solution. The most relevant market segments for initial introduction of the project solutions are Automotive (U5), computing and gaming (U7) and home appliances (U3).",True
"Title: MARCONI - Multimedia and Augmented Radio Creation: Online, iNteractive, Individual Abstract: Nowadays, radio shows surpass linear broadcast feeds by increasingly revolving around user engagement, which encompasses audience interaction and experience personalisation. Indeed, a typical consumer increasingly interacts with the radio station through digital platforms and social media. Unfortunately, the tools to enable radio-makers to capitalize on these new kinds of media and interaction opportunities are premature at best, and are in addition ill-aligned with contemporary radio production workflows.

MARCONI aims to bring radio experiences to the next level, enabling radio to safeguard its strong position in the European media market, while at the same time facilitating innovative ways of radio making. The goal is to enable fully interactive and personalised radio solutions, integrating broadcast radio with digital and social media, amounting to converged radio experiences. To realize this goal, MARCONI will pursue two concrete objectives. First, consumers will be able to interact with “live” radio through their preferred communication channel in ways that are richer than is feasible today, so that consumers feel more connected to the radio brand -even when not listening linearly- and better served in an individual way. Second, radio-makers will be given an integrated view on audience interactions and will be supported by interaction automation services. The net outcome will be enhanced audience engagement.

MARCONI brings together a multi-disciplinary consortium to realize its vision. Several partners will focus on AI to automate processing of audio-visuals, text and social media posts. A radio redaction solutions provider is represented in the consortium to guarantee smooth integration in real operational workflows.

"Title: STEVE - Smart-Taylored L-category Electric Vehicle demonstration in hEtherogeneous urbanuse-cases Abstract: Movement is at the heart of any city. Urban mobility faces significant challenges from two global megatrends: growing urbanisation and ageing population. Light electric vehicles (EL-Vs) could represent a viable solution to traffic congestion and pollution in cities. However, their successful integration into the urban transport system requires a clear understanding of the individual consumer needs.
By involving human science and transportation specialists, the STEVE partners have developed a framework to interpret these forces. Focus will be on mature cities of medium size (Torino: 800.000 inhabitants, Villach 60.000, Calvià 60.000, Venaria 35.000), where STEVE will generate data to support the design of next generation EL Vs, and provoke the mind-shift necessary for swift market penetration of them.

The primary idea of STEVE is to implement and test a human-centric approach to electro-Mobility-as-a-Service (eMaaS), according to the “Move2Me” vision of the consortium. This will provide low-cost and financially sustainable EL V solutions and “gamified” services, to enhance users’ awareness, engagement and vehicle energy efficiency.
A core item of STEVE is a low-cost electric quadricycle developed by a worldwide OEM in Turin, with start-of-production expected in 2018 at a market price of €8000. The quadricycle will integrate high-technology contents with respect to the current competitors, and will be pilot-tested, together with many other EL-Vs, during extensive demonstration phases in the four STEVE cities
STEVE will guarantee a strong impact in terms of business development and jobs, and enhance the European competitiveness in the eMaaS sector while also leveraging Manufacturing.

The consortium will also give a primary role to SMEs: while large enterprises will provide the underlying technologies, the services will be mainly designed and operated by SMEs, deeply involved in the local supply chains and adaptable to the specific customers’ needs.",True

"Title: CROWD4ROADS - CROWD sensing and ride sharing FOR ROAD Sustainability Abstract: Road networks are the largest publicly owned assets and they play a fundamental role in socio-economic development and
competitiveness. At the same time, roads have huge environmental impacts and maintenance costs. Passenger cars
account for 73.7% of total intra-EU passenger transport, with an average car occupancy rate well below 2 passengers per car. The resulting traffic accounts for about 12% of CO2 emissions. Delayed maintenance impairs road safety and increases cost of intervention, vehicle operating costs, and emissions.
The CROWD4ROADS project combines trip sharing and crowd sensing initiatives to harness collective intelligence to contribute
to the solution of the sustainability issues of road passenger transport, by increasing the car occupancy rate and by
engaging drivers and passengers in road monitoring.
BlaBlaCar (http://blablacar.com/) is the largest trusted ride sharing community worldwide, with more than 10.000.000
members in 14 countries, while SmartRoadSense (http://smartroadsense.it/) is a crowd sensing system which makes use of
the accelerometers of car-mounted smartphones to estimate the roughness of the road surface.
The CROWD4ROADS platform establishes a synergistic relationship between BlaBlaCar and SmartRoadSense, exploiting the network effect which is inherent in both the initiatives, to provide a sizeable impact in terms of car occupancy rate, road
monitoring, and end-user engagement in road maintenance and transport sustainability.
Scalability issues will be addressed during the project both from a technical and from a social point of view. The approach
will be validated on representative large scale pilots, involving more than 1 million people and covering more than 1 million
km of roads. Impacts will be measures in terms of road coverage, car occupancy rates, and open data volume.",True
"Title: WPCN - Wireless Powered Communication Networks: Architectures, Protocols and Optimized Resource Allocation Abstract: Wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is a promising networking paradigm for future wireless communication systems, where the batteries of wireless devices (WDs) are remotely replenished by means of microwave wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Compared to the conventional battery-powered communication networks, WPCN is in general more convenient by eliminating the hassle of connecting cables, more cost-effective by enabling on-demand energy supplies and maintenance-free operations, more environmental-friendly by avoiding tons of battery disposal yearly, and is sometimes essential for scenarios where manual battery replacement/recharging is too dangerous (e.g., in hazardous environment) or even impossible (e.g., for biomedical implants).  However, the practical deployment of WPCN is hampered by several critical issues, such as the low end-to-end WPT efficiency over a long  distance, the inter-play between power and information transmissions within the same network, and the challenges of scalability in large networks. This project aims to resolve the above issues by paving the way for the practical deployment of WPCN. Towards this end, a comprehensive study on WPCN will be pursued, ranging from the networking architecture and protocol designs to optimized resource allocation. A number of innovative techniques will be proposed and thoroughly investigated in this project, including the new heterogeneous networking architecture for WPCN, the harvest-and-transmit protocol facilitated by the concept of energy-and-information full-duplexing, and the distributed energy beamforming technique with the idea of WD-initiated WPT. The results obtained in this project will find a wide range of applications in the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication system, which involves numerous low-power WDs, including those in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), internet of things (IoT), and massive machine-type communications.",True
"Title: SAV-EO - Land Degradation Neutrality: Towards an Earth Observation-based Early Warning System for Savannah Degradation Abstract: Savannahs are important ecosystems that are found on almost half of the African continent. Unfortunately, they undergo massive conversions and are affected by land degradation processes leading to a decline in the ecosystem services they provide to some of the continent’s poorest and most vulnerable human populations. Reductions in the productivity of dryland savannahs have major social and political implications, and the United Nations (UN) has labelled the accurate quantification of savannah degradation as of high priority.

Monitoring the woody component of savannah land cover is, therefore, needed to enhance the understanding of broad-scale changes in savannahs & their relationship with ecosystem degradation. Over large scales, this can only be achieved in a cost-effective manner using Earth Observation (EO) technologies. The development of SAV-EO is, therefore, proposed which will employ novel remote sensing methodologies, based on thousands of freely-available optical & radar satellite data for the mapping & monitoring of fractional woody cover over the entire southern African savannah region (1,500,000km2). A monitoring tool that identifies underlying land degradation processes, such as bush encroachment & deforestation, will also be devised based on a dense time-series analysis approach using all available data from the 45-year long Landsat archive. Another objective of SAV-EO is to provide an advancement in the design of operational indicators for the assessment & monitoring of land degradation, within the Land Degradation Neutrality framework suggested by the UN, in order to achieve the target of the Sustainable Development Goals to combat desertification by the 2030.

The innovative algorithms, data & outputs will be made available open-access via a bespoke web-GIS platform & numerous dissemination & communication activities, thus providing an invaluable resource for scientists & policy makers alike.",True

"Title: SCREEN - Space Cognitive Radio for Electromagnetic Environment maNagement Abstract: The SCREEN project brings the concept of cognitive radio to Space and exploits the benefits that this technology has already shown in the terrestrial domain. The project will look into analysing, developing, implementing and testing cognitive radio algorithms. The ground breaking element in SCREEN is however the implementation and testing. Even though some of the underlying technologies for the individual stages are not novel, the incorporation of all stages in a radio transceiver has never been done to the full extent of a cognitive, and not adaptive, system.

The key enabling technology for cognitive radio is Software-Defined Radio (SDR), which provides the required flexibility to reconfigure the radio parameters autonomously and without any changes in the transceiver hardware. The Consortium will make use of proprietary SDR technology and use it for the implementation and testing. In fact, the project approach is to make use of terrestrial research results in cognitive radio at all levels (technological, market and regulatory) and capitalise the previous work done in different projects, avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts. The target spectrum band for this project is S-band, which is underexplored and has a strong potential for future niche applications both in satcom and in ISLs for multi-satellite missions. It also brings advantages regarding regulatory concerns.

This project clearly fits the topic, not only because its main goal is to evolve an innovative technology up to TRL4/5, but also because cognitive radio is a key enabling technology for the areas identified by the topic. This technology will lead to a new generation of satcom payloads and also have massive impact on ISLs and downlink subsystems. It also brings a terrestrial technology to space, together with new players, which has the possibility to dramatically improve the performance, efficiency and versatility of space communications.",True
"Title: MetalCell - Transition-Metal Mediated Chemistry in Cells Abstract: Over the past decade, metals which were previously restricted to conventional organic synthesis have begun to be used in an increasing number of biological settings. This has been dominated by copper mediated catalysis of the azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (1,3-dipolar addition) chemistry (the well know “click reaction”) but other, less toxic, metals such as palladium are now beginning to establish themselves in the chemical biology/ chemical medicine arenas. In this proposal, building on chemistry from the Bradley group (see Nature Chemistry, 2011 and Nature Communication, 2014) the potential of palladium mediated chemistry in living systems will be exploited. This will cover three main avenues of exploration: (i). The fabrication of active palladium catalysts conjugated to antibodies and small targeting peptides; (ii) Development of assays to allow the activity of the active catalysts to be determined both in vitro and inside cells and (iii). The application of these active palladium catalysts enable the conjugation of two drug “halves” to allow the in situ synthesis (inside cells) of active anticancer drugs.  This fellowship will bring together chemistry, biology and medicine, with potential longer-term biomedical applications with the training of the applicant in learning new chemistry and biological technique.

"Title: SmartLube - Surface functionalized-MoS2 nanofluids as high temperature lubricant additives Abstract: There is an increasing and urgent need in Europe and globally for effective and robust high temperature (HT) lubricant additives in critical industrial applications. Combining synergistically the exceptional oil solubility of organic polymers and the excellent tribological behaviour of MoS2 nanoparticles (NPs), polymer functionalized-MoS2 NPs with good dispersion stability will be designed and synthesized as candidates for HT lubricant additives. In addition, to suppress MoS2 oxidation under HT, which would cause high friction and wear, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) will be covalently combined with MoS2 NPs to improve the retention of MoS2 on the frictional surfaces and prevent oxidation during rubbing. In this project, MoS2 NPs will be functionalized by two methods: 1) Immobilization of organic polymer on the surface of MoS2 NPs using non-covalent and covalent approaches. The organic polymers including oil-soluble poly-(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA), polyalkylene glycol (PEG), and hyperbranched poly(3-ethyl-3-hydroxymethyloxetane) PEHO; 2) MoS2 NPs growing on the surface of organic polymer modified-CNMs with covalent bonds. The polymers connecting CNMs and MoS2 NPs are novel PEHO and PEG derivatives with lipoic acid (LA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) terminals. The properties of the grafted polymers on MoS2 NPs and CNMs will be analyzed. The dispersion stability of surface functionalization MoS2 NPs will be assessed by SAXS/SANS, as well as cryo-TEM, SEM, DLS, and ξ- potential measurements. The surface force apparatus (SFA) will be used for mechanistic understanding of how such NPs mediate friction, with the macroscopic HT tribological properties of the NP dispersions investigated using tribometer. The correlation between the NP physicochemical properties and their efficacy in lubrication will be assessed. The wear mechanism of surface functionalized-MoS2 NPs as friction reduction and antiwear (AW) additives in lubricating oils will be explored by XPS and SEM-EDS.",False
"Title: SimuSafe - SIMULATOR OF BEHAVIOURAL ASPECTS FOR SAFER TRANSPORT Abstract: Road transport is known to be the most dangerous of all transport modes and poses a major societal challenge for EU. It has been claimed that 90% of road-traffic crashes are caused by driver error, being a significant factor in traffic accidents. Improving road safety means understanding the individual and collective behaviour of actors involved (drivers, two wheelers, pedestrians) and their interaction between themselves and safety-related systems and services. The goal of SIMUSAFE (SIMUlator of Behavioural Aspects for SAFEr Transport) following the FESTA-V model methodology is to  develop realistic multi-agent behavioural models in a transit environment where researchers will be able to monitor and introduce changes in every aspect,  gathering data not available in real world conditions. 
Driving simulators of several vehicles (cars, motorcycles, bicycles) and Virtual Reality (for pedestrians) will be used to simulate test environments. This will also enable the evaluation of scenarios which are not possible even with naturalistic driving (dangerous conditions, multiple monitored actors in the same scene, under influence of substances). Data collected from simulations will be correlated with naturalistic driving tests, such that the simulation and model aspects are the closest possible to real world data. From the developed model and collected data, impacting factors causing an event (crash, near-collision, infractions) from the environment and road users will be identified and quantified. Such knowledge will be the base for the development of more effective and pro-active measures for the prevention and mitigation of such factors, with subsequent impact in the safety devices market, regulations and driver education.",True

"Title: EPIC - Enabling Practical Wireless Tb/s Communications with Next Generation Channel Coding Abstract: EPIC aims to develop a new generation of Forward-Error-Correction (FEC) codes to enable practical wireless Tb/s link technology—corresponding to a 10x–100x throughput improvement over the SoA. The EPIC concept and methodology is shaped by the key finding that routine progress in silicon technology in the next decade will not be sufficient to allow FEC implementations to break the Tb/s barrier; Tb/s FEC will require not only help from silicon technology but also major innovations in FEC algorithm design and implementation domains. A key EPIC objective is therefore to develop and utilize a disruptive FEC design framework that considers the FEC algorithm design and corresponding silicon implementation architectures in a unified fashion. Through such an integrated approach, EPIC aims to advance state-of-the-art FEC schemes (mainly Turbo, LDPC and Polar codes) to obtain the principal channel codes for beyond-5G (B5G) use-cases. Top-performing solutions developed under EPIC will be validated by virtual silicon tape-out implementations, thus providing first-in-class FEC blocks of wireless Tb/s technology.

"Title: DRmov - Deciphering the RBPome in mosquitoes during virus infection Abstract: The impact of mosquito-borne diseases has expanded dramatically in the last few decades to become an emerging global health problem, with around 1 billion new infections and 1 million deaths each year. In Europe there are more than 20 countries with established populations of invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are the principle vectors responsible for transmitting high-risk pathogens such as ZIKA virus (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHKV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitic virus (VEEV). Despite our vulnerabilities to mosquito-borne diseases, virus replication dynamics is still poorly understood especially in the invertebrate vectors. No treatment against these viruses targeting essential viral proteins are currently available. Thus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and its Vector Control Advisory Group has urged for insect vector control. Vector control is usually performed through insecticides; however, resistance can emerge in mosquitoes leading to persistence of the disease. Therefore, virologists are turning their interests toward host factors that play essential roles in infection as novel antiviral targets, since they can potentially exhibit broad-spectrum efficacy. In particular, scientists envision that genetically modified mosquitoes with disrupted genes required for infection can be re-inserted into natural habitats or through targeting these genes by RNAi in order to control viral spread. As all mosquito-borne viruses have RNA genome, cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) emerge as ideal targets for antiviral therapies, as they are key players in cellular and viral RNA metabolism . Thus, we propose here to profile comprehensively the compendium of mosquito RBPs (RBPome) using RNA-interactome capture (RNA-IC). Furthermore, we will apply different cutting-edge methods to identify the role of mosquito RBPs during virus infection.",False
"Title: ENTWINE - The European Training Network on Informal Care Abstract: Mostly due to increased longevity and medical advances, the needs of older/ill individuals for long-term care rise rapidly while the availability of informal caregivers decrease. Informal caregivers are those who provide unpaid care to a relative or friend with a chronic illness, disability or other long-lasting health or care need. This “Gare Gap” will create huge problems for the sustainability of European health care systems that rely heavily on the provision of informal care. The aim of ENTWINE’s multidisciplinary and inter-sectorial team is to investigate the broad spectrum of issues concerning the development and use of innovative psychosocial and technology-based interventions that support willingness and opportunity to provide informal care. WP 1 details the current and future caregiving challenges and motivations for diverse groups of informal caregivers and their care recipients, and society, in different countries that have different care systems by means of an intensive longitudinal cohort study (ENTWINE-iCohort). It will establish who needs support, what kind and when.

"Title: PACIFIC - Passive seismic techniques for environmentally friendly and cost efficient mineral exploration Abstract: ""The PACIFIC consortium will develop a new, low-cost and environmentally friendly tool for exploring for mineral deposits beneath the surface. The approach will build on the """"traditional"""" passive seismic method, which is capable of providing useful broad-brush background information about the geological and structural setting of mineralised regions, but lacks the resolution needed for reliable identification of ore bodies.

The ENCASE user-centric architecture will consist of three distinct services, which can be combined to form an effective protective net against cyberbullying and sexually abusive acts: a) a browser add-on with its corresponding scalable back-end software stack that collects the users’ online actions to unveil incidents of aggressive or  distressed behavior; b) a browser add-on  with its associated scalable software stack that analyses social web data to detect fraudulent and fake activity and alert the user; and c) a browser add-on that detects when a user is about to share sensitive content (e.g., photos or address information) with an inappropriate audience and warns the user or his parents of the imminent privacy threat. The third add-on has usable controls that enable users to protect their content by suggesting suitable access lists, by watermarking, and by securing the content via cryptography or steganography. The three browser add-ons and the back-end social web data analytics software stack will be assessed with user studies and piloting activities and will be released to the public. The foundation of the research and innovation activities will be a diligently planned inter-sectorial and interdisciplinary secondment program for Experienced and Early Stage Researchers that fosters knowledge exchange.  The academic partners will contribute know-how on user experience assessment, large scale data processing, machine learning and data-mining algorithm design, and content confidentiality techniques. The industrial partners will primarily offer expertise in production-grade software development, access to real-world online social network data, and access to numerous end-users through widely deployed products.",True
"Title: Loc8torHC - A disruptive healthcare monitoring solution that by nature of what and how it monitors (IoT) improves home safety, user wellbeing and provides early warning to help avoid critical admissions Abstract: Caring of ageing population will be one of the greatest challenges during this century. Most elderly people want to remain independent in their own homes for as long as possible. This decision can cause their children to worry about their parents’ wellbeing. This is when technology enabled care services (TECS), such as telecare and telehealth, provides a solution. TECS revenues in the EU28+2 countries reached an estimated €1.89 billion in 2013. 

To cope with this demand, next-generation telecare and tele-health platforms need to be enriched with innovative products. However, current monitoring devices for the elderly, can be divided into two types. The first is nothing more than a panic button connected to a 24-hour emergency telephone operator. It does little, costs a lot, and results in a lot of false alarms. The second kind is an incredibly complex, medical device that is beyond most seniors’ (and carers’) understanding which prevents mass market adoption. 

Loc8tor HealthCare (Loc8torHC), a disruptive, cost effective, scalable TECS platform targeted at the retail market. The core platform will be simple and work out of the box with no installation. Meanwhile, the carer can go online and configure the type of information they want the platform to send them, how often they want to receive updates, and whether they want updates in an e-mail, text message, or some other format.

The core product will include 6 core services; location, wander, fall, panic, activity and temperature in one device. Our competitive advantage is that our platform can easily be configured for numerous applications by adding 3rd party devices (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) through a plug and play Bluetooth port. The data collected from the medical sensors, combined with daily activity patterns (core Loc8torHC tags), and any other data sources (weather, pollution etc.) will be processed through our algorithm to generate a recommended diagnostic output in real time.",True
"Title: Photonic Radar - Implementation of Long Reach Hybrid Photonic Radar System and convergence over FSO and PON Networks Abstract: The conventional radar systems, operating in mm-wave (MMW) i.e. beyond 30 GHz, are exposed to high free-path losses (≥ 1 dB/km) and the situation becomes more punitive under severe environment conditions, for instance, Heavy rain and fog. Moreover, the traditional radar distribution networks are realized with conventional cables or space-feeds that results in a massive, complex and inflexible system. To overcome these issues, the hybrid photonic-based radar system (PHRAD) emerges as a promising candidate, providing low-loss, immunity to EM interference and high bandwidth capacity. These robust properties of photonics play a vital role in realization of PHRAD transceiver with improved navigation and detection. Although, the possibility of multiband PHRAD, capable to work in both S-and X-band, becomes feasible that reduces the weight, size and cost of the system. Alternatively, the state-of-the-art electronic techniques have not the required potential to make such radars feasible. The key goal of the proposed project is to develop a PHRAD transceiver tunable over a wide frequency range (≥ 40GHz) and immune to phase fluctuations in order to realize a robust navigation and detection system capable of providing high imagery-resolution and accuracy.  The proposed work will be carried out in three phases.  In phase I, Mode lock Lasers will be cultivated to generate wide-range and phase-stable radar signals in MMW. These wide-bandwidth signals (40-80GHz) will help to provide high imagery-resolution with accurate speed-computation of objects that lead to a reliable and secure navigation to the autonomous vehicles. In phase II, a multiband PHRAD transceiver will be designed to provide high frequency-flexibility that provides capability to track any frequency signal within S-or X-band. The phase III is dedicated to the implementation of the developed multiband PHRAD in real-time environment, especially in intelligent transport system (ITS), for its testing and evaluation.",True
"Title: UEWC - Ubiqutek Electrical Weed Control (UEWC): An advanced electrical weed control device to be integrated with existing agricultural equipment, yielding a zero chemical, organic result at a reduced cost Abstract: Reduced herbicides! Ubiqutek presents the first to market agricultural electrical weed control, Ubiqutek Glide a cost-effective, safe to use and environmentally friendly solution to be integrated to existing technology manufacturer’s platforms. 
Benefiting the agricultural market, Glide successfully controls weeds, whilst reducing operational costs and the industries use of herbicides and replacing with an organic process that maintains soil moisture and nutrients and increases the markets operational capability.

Having already developed Ubiqutek Touch, a horticultural and amenity electronic weed control device that has been well received by the market, we are well placed to adapt our technology for the agricultural market. Weeds are controlled largely for food production, although there are numerous applications for aesthetic, safety and recreational purposes. End users can range from individual farmers through to large civic authorities. Weed control is economically significant: removing weed control from food production could cost the UK economy €99.3Bn, whilst dealing with invasive species in the UK in 2010 cost €2.41bn.

With herbicides being legislated against and given the increasing global food requirements, alternative weed control technology is essential in the prevention of unsustainable food inflation. 

This Horizon 2020 Phase 1 project will allow us to establish contact with European agricultural manufacturers of existing platform technology and establish their need for this technology in the marketplace they operate in and the size of their market place, validating our technology and confirming our route to market. We will also complete IP protection activities and prepare for Phase 2 application.",False
"Title: SpinReMag - Molecular Spintronics using Isolated Rare Earth Magnets Abstract: A revolution is underway, as the fast-paced electronics industry moves towards the nanoscale, researchers are starting to consider single-molecule electronics. Such devices are within reach partly due to a new field, called molecular spintronics, which permits the prospect of controlling both spin and charge in single molecules. On the other hand, we know almost nothing about how a magnetic molecule is affected by electrons flowing through it or what chemical ingredients it takes to construct perspective devices. SpinReMag will investigate these uncharted waters by exploring the boundary between chemistry and single-molecule read-out technology. SpinReMag is a strongly multidisciplinary project utilizing an innovative mix of synthetic chemistry, physics and materials methodology to overcome present experimental limitations. Our design approach is to investigate single-molecule junctions, except instead of placing a molecules between bulk electrodes, we will directly grow photoactive groups on the molecule so that electrons will flow through or close to the spin center after a light pulse. This affords an ultra-clean system that can be studied in bulk, with a perfectly defined geometry of the magnetic and electronic elements. SpinReMag will provide the fundamental ground work to explain how molecular spins interact with flowing electrons. The execution of this project will for the first time provide the understanding of fundamental spintronic processes, and open new pathways to the rational design of single-molecule spintronics. The information gathered by SpinReMag will direct the future of research in single-molecule electronics and in the optical control of spin systems in general.",False
"Title: PROTEGO - Procedural Tools for Effective Governance (PROTEGO)  Patterns, Outcomes and Policy Design Procedural Tools for Effective Growth: Patterns, Outcomes and policy Design Abstract: PROTEGO arises out of a fundamental claim: procedural regulatory instruments have causal effects on the performance of political systems because they trigger accountability towards different stakeholders. The mix of policy instruments may be functional or dysfunctional, depending on how accountability mechanisms are combined. This project provides a theoretical rationale to capture the accountability effects by adopting an extension of delegation theory that considers multiple stakeholders. The theoretical framework will allow us to identify the key social mechanisms that make bureaucracies internalize the preferences of accountees. We will test the observable implications of the framework on outcomes that are crucial to the performance of political systems, such as trust in government, ease of business, control of corruption, sustainability. Empirically, we will collect, validate and analyze original data across the EU and its 28 Member States for the period 2000-2015, distinguishing between instruments that cover central departmental activity and independent regulatory agencies. The new dataset will cover administrative procedure acts, freedom of information, notice and comment, judicial review, impact assessment, environmental appraisal, and non-financial instruments for public spending accountability. These are the procedural instruments that enfranchise accountees. The bivariate relationship between a single instrument and outcomes explains little – because it’s the overall ecology or mix of instruments that produces causal effects. These ecologies combine in different sequences and paths associated with the outcome. Hence we will draw on a suitable methodological approach - Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Causality and diffusion across time will be also explored via event-history analysis and principal component analysis. PROTEGO will contribute to theories of regulation and accountability, and provide a robust operational model of data and analysis.",False
"Title: NESTOR - aN Enhanced pre-frontier intelligence picture to Safeguard The EurOpean boRders Abstract: For the past few years, Europe has experienced some major changes at its surrounding territories and in adjacent countries which provoked serious issues at different levels. The European Community faces a number of challenges both at a political and at a tactical level. Irregular migration flows exerting significant pressure to the relevant authorities and agencies that operate at border territories. Armed conflicts, climate pressure and unpredictable factors occurring at the EU external borders, have increased the number of the reported transnational crimes. Smuggling activity is a major concern for Eastern EU Borders particularly, as monitoring the routes used by smugglers is being hindered by mountainous, densely forested areas and rough lands aside with sea or river areas. Due to the severity and the abrupt emergence of events, the relevant authorities operate for a long-time interval, under harsh conditions, 24 hours a day. NESTOR aims to demonstrate a fully functional next generation holistic border surveillance system providing pre-frontier situational awareness beyond maritime and land border areas following the concept of the European Integrated Border Management. NESTOR long-range and wide area surveillance capabilities for detection, recognition classification and tracking of moving targets (e.g. persons, vessels, vehicles, drones etc.) is based on optical, thermal imaging and Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum analysis technologies fed by an interoperable sensors network including stationary installations and mobile manned or unmanned vehicles (aerial, ground, water, underwater) capable of functioning both as standalone, tethered and in swarms.

"Title: ABC-SALT - Advanced Biomass Catalytic Conversion to Middle Distillates in Molten Salts Abstract: ABC-SALT will validate at lab scale a novel route to produce sustainable liquid biofuels (middle distillates (MD)) from various lignocellulosic waste streams for the transport industry, both on roads (biodiesel) and in air (jet fuel), targeting a yield over 35 wt% in the middle distillate range, based on the biomass dry input, and a carbon yield of 55 %.
ABC-SALT will solve the following technical challenges: liquefaction and subsequent catalytic hydro-pyrolysis of the biomass in a molten salt environment, followed by the catalytic hydro-deoxygenation of the vapour phase using suitable catalysts to obtain a hydrocarbon product suitable for use as a MD biofuel. ABC-SALT will then operate an integrated lab scale reactor during over 100 hours to provide lab-scale validation of the whole process, bringing this technology to TRL 4.
The project includes technical aspects (such as substrate flexibility, biomass liquefaction and hydro-pyrolysis in molten salts and subsequent hydro-deoxygenation and their integration), but also a socio- and techno-economic viability study of the technology (substrate availability and supply chain, future end-users and economic sustainability of the process). This will ensure the future deployment of this new technology considering its social related issues, such as acceptance or modification of the perception of transport induced by such sustainable fuels. Such a holistic approach considering the full value chain, combined to communication with stakeholders during the course of the project, will provide valuable input for scale up and industry-oriented research after this project, maximizing the impact, amongst other in the biomass, biofuel and transport industry.
To reach its objectives, the project covers the whole value chain, from feedstock supplier to end-users (knowledge users (RUG, UG, AU, NMBU, DLR), technology users (BTG, Innventia), and middle distillates users (through DLR)), as well as an entity dedicated to SSH aspects (CIRPA).",False

"Title: ROBORDER - autonomous swarm of heterogeneous RObots for BORDER surveillance Abstract: Border authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) across Europe face important challenges in how they patrol and protect the borders. Their work becomes more problematic considering the heterogeneity of threats, the wideness of the surveyed area, the adverse weather conditions and the wide range of terrains. Although there are several research tools and works targeting these areas independently for border surveillance, nowadays border authorities do not have access to an intelligent holistic solution providing all aforementioned functionalities.
Towards delivering such a solution, ROBORDER aims at developing and demonstrating a fully-functional autonomous border surveillance system with unmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles, capable of functioning both as standalone and in swarms, which will incorporate multimodal sensors as part of an interoperable network. The system will be equipped with adaptable sensing and robotic technologies that can operate in a wide range of operational and environmental settings. To provide a complete and detailed situational awareness picture that supports highly efficient operations, the network of sensors will include static networked sensors such as border surveillance radars, as well as mobile sensors customised and installed on board unmanned vehicles. 
To succeed implementing an operational solution, a number of supplementary technologies will also be applied that will enable the establishment of robust communication links between the command and control unit and the heterogeneous robots. On top of this, detection capabilities for early identification of criminal activities and hazardous incidents will be developed. This information will be forwarded to the command and control unit that will enable the integration of large volumes of heterogeneous sensor data and the provision of a quick overview of the situation at a glance to the operators, supporting them in their decisions.",True
"Title: 3SST2015 - Third funding line in 2015 for the establishment of a European SST service provision function Abstract: This 3SST2015 project is aimed at supporting the emergence of a European SST service built on a network of existing SST assets, notably sensors (radar, laser and telescopes) owned by SST Consortium Member States. This will require the commitment of Consortium Member States owing relevant assets to cooperate and provide an anti-collision, fragmentation and re-entry service at European level in order to increase the autonomy of Europe concerning the operational objectives derived from the SST decision, which will be partially fulfilled by the operation of the initial European SST system.
Given that this system is mainly based on national systems, at the initial stage many of the activities will be based at national level. At the same time, and in order to achieve the convergence within a joint action that will allow the minimum desirable level of performance, an appropriate degree of coordination between SST Consortium Member States is needed.
The project is following a shared working approach between the key players within the field of SST in Europe. Following the guidelines given by the implementing decision of the European Commission (C(2014)6342 final of the 12.09.2014), the backbone of the planned activity is formed by a set of SST committees forming the decision platform of the SST Consortium, composed of the five designated national entities in cooperation mechanisms with the EU SatCen.
Three Committees  are foreseen for the governing structure of the SST Consortium: the Steering Committee as the decision platform, the Technical Committee as the professional motor and to the Security Committee dealing with bi- and multilateral aspects of security constraints and issues.

"Title: CYPNASH - Validation of a novel class of cyclophilin inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Abstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly prevalent chronic liver disease (3-4% of the US population) for which there is currently no approved drug therapy. In the absence of innovative treatments healthcare costs associated with this disease are set to triple over the next decade. To address this unmet medical need, the pharmaceutical industry is currently pursuing a range of liver fibrosis drug discovery programs based on different mode of actions. A compelling mechanism for treating liver damage is pharmacological modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in liver cells via inhibition of the protein cyclophilin D. However existing cyclophilin inhibitors based on peptidic macrocyclic scaffolds are challenging to optimize into sub-type selective orally bioavailable agents suitable for clinical trials of liver fibrosis. 

As part of basic research activities undertaken during ERC StG EBDD to validate a computational-biophysical drug discovery platform, we have discovered a structurally novel family of small molecules that inhibit cyclophilins by targeting a previously unexplored binding pocket. The objective of this POC is to identify a lead compound in this family with potential for development towards a NASH clinical candidate. Such a candidate will form the basis of follow-on lead optimisation programs pursued via partnering or out-licensing with a pharmaceutical partner. The activities of this POC will focus on assembling a data package of in vitro DMPK, in vivo PK, in vitro sub-type selectivity and in vitro and in vivo efficacy measurements in relevant cellular and animal models of liver fibrosis. This POC has been designed in consultation with a major pharmaceutical company and assembles a team of physical and biological scientists and business development executives to maximize the likelihood of delivering a valuable preclinical NASH asset.",False
"Title: VASA - Vaccine Against Schistosomiasis for Africa. A Phase I clinical study of the SchistoShield® anti-schistosomiasis vaccine in adults in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa Abstract: Schistosomiasis is a poverty-related neglected tropical disease, impacting one billion people in 74 countries. Science ranked a schistosomiasis-vaccine as one of the top-10 vaccines urgently needed. Chemotherapy is the preferred method for schistosomiasis control; but the effectiveness of mass-treatment programs is compromised by reinfection requiring regular re-treatment. An efficacious vaccine, with long-lasting protection against all schistosomiasis forms, would impact disease control. We request funding for the clinical development of our SchistoShield®-vaccine (Sm- p80 antigen+GLA-SE adjuvant) in Burkina Faso and Madagascar, where Schistosoma mansoni (causing intestinal/ hepatic schistosomiasis) and S. haematobium (causing urinary schistosomiasis) are endemic. In baboon studies, SchistoShield® has been effective against all major schistosome species. It is the only vaccine candidate having consistently exhibited potent prophylactic, anti-fecundity, egg-induced pathology resolving, transmission-blocking and therapeutic efficacy. The objectives are to 1) assess the safety/immunogenicity of SchistoShield® in a Phase I clinical study in healthy adults from Africa; 2) refine and develop a female worm schistosome human challenge model; 3) identify correlates of protection, innate and adaptive immune signatures, gene expression and the role of antibodies in the prevention/control of Schistosoma infections; and 4) foster a global consortium to advance research on schistosomiasis disease burden, vaccines and address downstream access constraints in resource-poor settings. The funding requested will allow the clinical development of SchistoShield®.

"Title: SANSA - Shared Access Terrestrial-Satellite Backhaul Network enabled by Smart Antennas Abstract: The aim of SANSA project is to boost the performance of mobile wireless backhaul networks in terms of capacity and resilience while assuring an efficient use of the spectrum. Recently, a global mobile traffic increase of 11-fold between 2013 and 2018 was predicted, so novel solutions are required to avoid backhaul becoming the bottle neck of future mobile networks.  The solution envisaged in SANSA is a spectrum efficient self-reconfigurable hybrid terrestrial-satellite backhaul network based on three key principles: (i) a seamless integration of the satellite segment into terrestrial backhaul networks; (ii) a terrestrial wireless network capable of reconfiguring its topology according to traffic demands; (iii) a shared spectrum between satellite and terrestrial segments. This combination will result in a flexible solution capable of efficiently routing the mobile traffic in terms of capacity and energy efficiency, while providing resilience against link failures or congestion and easy deployment in rural areas. Therefore, we will develop novel smart antennas, dynamic radio resource management and data-based shared access techniques for enabling the spectrum sharing among both segments, as well as efficient management and routing solutions for the hybrid network. These studies will yield to the implementation and demonstration of the two key components proof of concepts:  (i) low-cost smart antennas (to be deployed in terrestrial nodes) with beam and null-steering capabilities for interference mitigation between satellite and terrestrial transceivers and network topology reconfiguration; (ii) hybrid network manager capable of controlling the resources of the hybrid network. Besides indirectly allowing the traffic increase to the mobile users, the SANSA project will set the path for a win-win collaboration between satellite and terrestrial operators that will strengthen both European sectors and also their related industries such as equipment manufacturers.",True
"Title: Aeropaft - Delay of flow separation and stall on Aerofoils using a Passive Flow control Technology which will improve aerodynamic performance and stability of wind turbines increasing their range of operation Abstract: Flow separation and dynamic stalling in aerofoils result in increased drag, reduced lift and increased dynamic loads on aerodynamic devices/vehicles. This culminates in reduced aerodynamic efficiency and increased structural vibrations, which are noisy and reduce the operating life of aerodynamic devices. To delay flow separations and dynamic stalling, flow control is engaged either actively (artificial means) or passively (natural means). This project describes a novel passive flow control method (Aeropaft) to be applied primarily in the wind turbine (WT) industry, then to aircraft and ground and marine vehicles.
Wind energy is the fastest growing Renewable Energy source (RES) at 24.4% per year. To keep pace with growing demand, there is need for advanced technologies to increase the aerodynamic efficiency. Aeropaft is a simple technology exploiting high velocity currents from near the leading edge (via internal ducts) to re-energise the free-stream flow at the top of an aerofoil. This results in a 5% increase in electrical power yield for a 1MW WT, increase in lift (~16%), reduction of profile drag force (~7%) at higher aerofoil angles of incidences (>12o), and the reduction of wear caused by vibrations. We will penetrate 1% of the global WT market and 10% of the European market. Licensed Manufacturers stand to gain a 0.33% increase in market value and revenue of €1.72bn, while utility companies gain €101,013 per annum through savings and increased energy output per WT. Our revenue will come through licensing at 0.2% of the whole turbine cost translating to revenue of €10.3m and profits of €7.72m, five years post commercialization.
Phase 1 will entail a market study, partner search, assessing structural integrity issues and developing an IP and commercialisation strategy.
Phase 2 will be to modify blades of existing WTs with our technology and test demonstrate in the operational environment.",False
"Title: ATOM - Attention to Marketing (ATOM): Application of eye-tracking to the online market for advertising Abstract: In the 19th century John Wanamaker quipped that “half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half”. For advertisers in the 21st century the situation has become much worse; up to 98% of click-throughs may actually be from “bots” rather than real people, and only 44% of page impressions even appear on people’s screens. As a result, the €500m global advertising market is highly inefficient; advertisers are buying blindfold and publishers of genuinely engaging content are undervalued as the bad drives out the good. The ATOM project will address these problems by using eye tracking to accurately measure whether ads actually get seen, by whom, and for how long, enabling market participants to trade the asset they are really interested in – people’s attention.

The project will assess the technical feasibility and potential value of various routes to market that arise from scaling Lumen’s existing in-home eye-tracking platform, LUCIAR. LUCIAR collects and analyses eye-tracking data from small panels for testing and optimising the design of advertising. Scaling LUCIAR will provide robust, real-time data on attention to advertising down the long-tail of inventory, with applications in (i) monitoring the attention advertisers are achieving among specific audiences, (ii) valuing publisher’s inventory and the contribution of content providers, and (iii) “programmatic” algorithmic media buying. 

Europe is well placed to lead this disruption of the advertising industry. The world’s leading eye-tracking hardware companies are based in Europe (Tobii in Sweden; SMI in Germany; EyeTribe in Denmark) and London is a major global locus and leading market in new innovations for the advertising industry. Through the application of eye-tracking technology there is massive potential for European companies to transform the global advertising market.",False
"Title: SOOCCESS - SOciO-eConomiC failurE and aSpiration biaseS Abstract: From early childhood, many poor children brought up in segregated communities observe socio-economic failures such as poor living conditions, liquidity constraints, extremely high unemployment and low education levels attained by adults. Enhancing their aspirations is believed to be a tool capable of breaking one of the poverty feedback loops: poverty has been identified as a cause of the failure to aspire to one’s own potential, and at the same time, low aspirations are among the potential causes of persistent poverty. Consequently, adolescents from areas of high deprivation are generally believed to have low aspirations, though, in fact, their aspirations vary considerably, and may be generally high. This signals two main aspiration biases: aspirations failure and aspirational gap. This project is aimed to investigate how stimulating success/failure environments can reduce aspiration biases of the segregated poor, which, according to theory, should increase their chances to escape the poverty trap. The project has an interdisciplinary character: it is aimed to investigate the psychological construct of aspirations in the economic context in educational environments. Using cutting-edge methods from behavioural and experimental economics, we will experimentally investigate to what extent exposure to success/failure environments will lead to a significant decrease/increase in aspirational biases. From the methodological perspective, we will first design a novel approach to the experimental elicitation of aspirations, then we will design an experiment manipulating success/failure to assess their effects on aspirations. From the empirical viewpoint, using experimental data, the project will shed new light on the relationship between socio-economic background and aspirational biases, and thus test the predictions of economic theory. To address the concern of external validity, the proposed experiments will be conducted in different cultural settings.",False
"Title: TRACKSCAN - A practical, portable and robust scanning system using infrastructure inspection radar (IIR) for the investigation of rail track substructure, ballast and tunnel infrastructure Abstract: This is a feasibility study to enable the development of a novel portable radar system that provides a simple non-invasive mechanism for inspecting railway infrastructure. At present different techniques are needed to inspect the ballast, track substructure and tunnels. TRACKSCAN would undertake these activities and more through non-invasive inspection. Within Europe ballast inspection requires digging a trench or driving plastic lined steel tubes into ballast with a pneumatic hammer. This is obviously impractical, time consuming, labour intensive and can miss ballast fouling. TRACKSCAN inspects all ballast so that maintenance can be targeted and effective. The feasibility study proposed intends to verify the technological and practical aspects of the system and ensure the business concept is sound. The system is described in terms of what can be achieved the science behind it is retained as confidential, as permitted by the call. The penetrating radar system has a rotating antenna which allows 360 degrees inspection and in any plane, this means that unlike other ballast inspection systems in the US, the TRACKSCAN system can extend beyond the vehicle width. The TRACKSCAN system is innovative, unique and we believe has a large market potential. The areas of inspection include: ballast; sub-ballast including drainage systems; water pipes and utilities, tunnel linings and tunnel track systems and bridge surface structures.
There is already interest from infrastructure owners and maintenance organisations such as Turkish Railways (TCDD) who have indicated their support as potential user/customers and will identify their needs and define the future work within Phase 2. Phase 1 will investigate:
•	Technological and practical viability and science, technology and innovation required in Phase 2
•	Economic viability and market potential
•	User needs for the system 
•	IPR (patent) and licensing
•	Business models and partners for Phase 2 and production of the system.",True
"Title: UnRi - Understanding the discourse-semantic shift towards risk in the UK and Germany Abstract: This project aims to advance our understanding of the forces that have driven the proliferation of risk discourses in the UK and Germany since World War Two. Working at the boundaries of risk sociology and corpus linguistics, this is a highly innovative enterprise, both theoretically and methodologically. It will examine the contribution made by main-stream risk theories to explaining the increasing use of the risk semantic in media coverage during the last 50 years, and it will develop an empirically grounded theory of the observable shift towards risk. The Fellow will utilise cutting-edge corpus-based research strategies to systematically reconstruct the changing use of the discourse-semantics of risk and will complement these with interviews of media experts to examine how these changes are linked to institutional and socio-cultural changes and historically significant events.
The Fellow is an outstanding scholar in risk studies who will further develop his skills and expand his networks among eminent European sociologists and corpus linguists. The IF will be placed with Prof McEnery, a leading scholar in corpus research at Lancaster University, who is the Director of the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS). This will be complemented by a secondment with Prof Kämper, an expert in historical linguistic change, at the Institute of German Language (IDS) in Mannheim. Both these opportunities will allow the Fellow to build on existing networks with scholars working in the maturing domain of corpus-driven social science research. Working with corpus based discourse analysts and computational linguists at CASS and IDS will allow the Fellow to firmly establish his skills in the application of corpus based discourse analysis within the social sciences and will enhance his opportunities to reintegrate into the European academic community.",False

Abstract: The Triangulum project will demonstrate how a systems innovation approach based around the European Commission’s SCC Strategic Implementation Plan can drive dynamic smart city development. We will test the SIP across three lighthouse cities: Manchester, Eindhoven and Stavanger, which represent the main typologies of European cities. They will be complemented by our follower cities Prague, Leipzig and Sabadell. This powerful combination reflects an urban population of between 100k and 1,2m inhabitants across six different countries, allowing us to demonstrate successful replication across a wide range of typical urban areas in Europe. Each city has already made significant progress towards the transition of becoming a smart city; developing their own individual approach reflecting specific local circumstances. These inherent strengths will now serve to accelerate the smart city development across proposed demonstration sites within Triangulum. The suite of projects developed will be based around zero/low energy districts, integrated infrastructures and sustainable urban mobility designed to deliver a range of cross-cutting outcomes across different sectors and stakeholders. This will provide the basis to ‘road test’ the SIP and provide recommendations to the Commission on how it could be improved to facilitate wider replication.

"Title: CAPaCITy - Designing Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalysis and Ion Transport Abstract: Solar energy conversion will play an essential role in the future supply of clean energy. Secure access to energy sources will require energy conversion technologies that are low impact, distributed and accessible both technically and financially. Molecular electronic materials embody these possibilities, offering facile synthesis, low energy production and the versatility to allow performance to be maximized for specific applications. Moreover, they bring appealing similarities with nature’s intrinsically low impact energy conversion materials. Whilst molecular semiconductors have been studied in detail for solar-to-electric energy conversion they have seldom been studied for solar-to-chemical conversion or for charge storage. However, they bring exciting potential advantages in terms of their light harvesting properties, the range of microstructures possible and the ability to tune their electrical properties. Polymer materials applied to solar chemical generation could open up an innovative route to artificial fuels, with the option to control light harvesting and charge separation through structural control. Polymer materials applied to mixed (electronic / ionic) conduction provide a route to lower cost electrochemical storage, as well as to biocompatible devices and sensors. Stimulated by recent experimental breakthroughs in the application of polymers as photocatalysts and ion transport media I will exploit my expertise in multi-scale modelling and functional characterization of molecular electronic materials and devices to develop a design framework for energy conversion and storage in conjugated polymer materials. This proposal aims to disentangle the parameters that govern the performance of conjugated polymer based photocatalysts and ion transport media to discover the underlying functional mechanisms.

"Title: AlFHoNSo - Analysing Forest Hydrocarbons with Networks of Sensors Abstract: Forested ecosystems play a central role in the Earth system. However, whether for the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the uptake of ozone or the emission of reactive carbon, small-scale variability inherent in forests makes their parameterisation in models difficult. Recent developments in cheap, small, lower power sensors and robust network technology can ultimately drive a range of science communities (ecology, atmospheric chemistry, carbon flux) towards a new concept of a ‘highly instrumented forest’. Within a highly instrumented forest, the environment is autonomously observed using large numbers of low cost sensors, giving a wide spatial perspective on forest interactions with the atmosphere. Such an approach contrasts markedly with the current paradigm where a single site, equipped with a small number of highly specialised instruments, is treated as being representative of a whole forest. This fellowship will develop and apply a unique sensor network for assessment of the spatial and long-term temporal variability in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by forests. VOCs play a vital role in controlling the regional and global concentration of ozone, aerosol and methane, all of which are key players in climate change and air quality degradation, but the spatial heterogeneity of emissions from forests is unknown. The sensors will be tested both in the laboratory and in small-scale trials. The fellowship will culminate in the application of a sensor network in a UK Forestry Commission research forest, to resolve for the first time the true spatial and temporal variability of biogenic VOCs throughout a forest canopy. This fellowship will exploit the fellow’s experience gained in the UK and USA, and the world-leading expertise at the University of York to produce new earth system science and a transferable chemical technology applicable to other research questions, whilst propelling an exciting researcher’s career onto the highest scientific track.",False

"Title: MRECS - Managing Risk in Early Complex Societies in Syria-Palestine: An Investigation of Changing Animal Herding Strategies through the 4th-2nd Millennia BC Using Multi-Element Isotopic Analysis Abstract: The proposed research at Durham investigates the role of pastoral mobility in the rise of urban societies and large, integrated supra-regional economies in western Syria during the 3rd millennium BC through isotopic analysis of skeletal remains.  During this period, state-level political systems developed and there was a massive expansion of urban settlement into the arid Syrian steppe. Scholars at Durham have proposed that elite exploitation of the economic opportunities provided by the humble sheep for the development of a vast new livestock-based economy lay at the heart of this transformation, representing a fundamental shift in socio-political networks, economic resilience and risk management strategies. Although material culture and texts provide clear indications about the vital significance of the wool industry in these major socio-economic changes, the proposed research will provide the first reliable means of directly testing these hypotheses by using multi-element isotopic analysis of archaeological animal enamel and bone to examine changes in animal management and herding strategies in Syria-Palestine in the 4th-2nd millennia BC.  Two case studies will represent areas close to the core of this emerging system of economic intensification, and more peripheral areas that were likely impacted by these changes in more subtle ways.",False
"Title: SHERO - Self-HEaling soft RObotics Abstract: ""While artificial intelligence, robotics and computing power advance at a stunning pace, the physical interactions between such systems remain as an unsolved question. Replacement aftermarket parts for robotics account for $400 billion a year. This figure, comparable to the entire GDP of Belgium, could be reduced if smart materials were combined with robotics and AI to heal robotic parts or prevent damage. The natural healing function has inspired chemists to impart similar properties to synthetic materials, creating “self-healing materials"""". These materials have the ability to recover their key-properties after damage through a self-healing (SH) mechanism. A broad range of SH materials has been developed, based on a variety of chemical and physical principles, and has led to innovative applications. While Europe was well positioned in the discovery of new SH materials, this project aims to take a leading position in an emerging area of application of these materials. In robotics and machines in general, SH materials and healing abilities have not yet been explored. This project will realize the scientifically ambitious and technologically concrete breakthroughs to exploit the combination of self-healing materials with (damage) sensing capabilities, intelligence and automated healing in soft robotics. This implies the design of anthropomorphic materials, capable of feeling pain. By intelligent control the inflicted damage will prompt the whole system to rest and heal before (more) serious damage occurs, restoring not only structural integrity by reattaching broken parts, but also restoring complex functions like sensing and actuation. To achieve this, dedicated SH materials will be synthesized and characterised, SH actuators and sensors will be created, and dedicated control intelligence for structural health monitoring and autonomous SH procedures will be investigated. All these technologies will be integrated in two demonstrators to disseminate the objectives.""",False

"Title: DOMUS - Design  OptiMisation for efficient electric vehicles based on a USer-centric approach Abstract: The DOMUS project aims to change radically the way in which vehicle passenger compartments and their respective comfort control systems are designed so as to optimise energy use and efficiency while keeping user comfort and safety needs central. Although a more thorough understanding of thermal comfort over recent years has led to significant increases in energy efficiency through better insulation and natural ventilation, substantial room for improvement still exists. With Electric Vehicles (EVs) in particular, which are emerging as the most sustainable option for both satisfying the future mobility needs in Europe and reducing the impact on the environment, inefficiencies must be minimized due to their detrimental effect on the range.
Starting with activities to gain a better understanding of comfort, combined with the development of numerical models which represent both the thermal and acoustic characteristics of the passenger compartment, DOMUS aims to create a validated framework for virtual assessment and optimization of the energy used. In parallel, innovative solutions for glazing, seats, insulation and radiant panels, will be developed along with controllers to optimize their performance individually and when operating in combination, the optimal configuration of which will be derived through numerical simulation.
The aim is that the combined approach of innovating at a component level together with optimising the overall configuration will deliver at least the targeted 25% improvement in EV range without compromising passenger comfort and safety. Furthermore, the project will demonstrate the key elements of the new approach in a real prototype vehicle. As such DOMUS aims to create a revolutionary approach to the design of vehicles from a user-centric perspective for optimal efficiency, the application of which will be key to increasing range and hence customer acceptance and market penetration of EVs in Europe and around the world in the coming years.",False
"Title: FunMagResBeacons - Functionalized Magnetic Resonance Beacons for Enhanced Spectroscopy and Imaging Abstract: ""This project will develop and demonstrate molecular agents called functional magnetic resonance beacons (fMRBs). These will provide a new set of versatile spectroscopic tools for the spatially resolved study of chemistry, biochemistry, diffusion, flow and percolation inside opaque objects. The fMRB agents support hyperpolarized nuclear spin order, which generates enormously enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. The agents are designed to maintain such order for long times (between 5 minutes and several hours) in ambient temperature solution, enabling their transport deep inside opaque objects. The molecules are functionalized, so that they “light up"""" in an NMR or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment, upon triggering by specific chemical signals or physical conditions (sensory functionality), and may also to bind to selected molecular targets (binding functionality). One set of proposed realisations possesses “lock-and-key” functionality, meaning that the hyperpolarized nuclear spin order is “locked” into a form which is invisible in the NMR spectrometer, but which may be “unlocked” at any chosen time by applying a suitable radiofrequency pulse sequence. The following molecular moieties are proposed as storage modules: (1) molecular cages, such as functionalized C60 fullerenes, encapsulating noble gas atoms such as 3He; (2) spin clusters supporting long-lived states, such as pairs of 13C or 15N nuclei, in shielded molecular environments. The sensory moieties include tailored peptide sequences, which may be activated by the presence of particular proteases, while binding modules include moieties such as biotin. The agents are designed to be conveniently transportable in a hyperpolarized state. Potential long-term applications include in vivo molecular imaging by MRI.

"Title: ES-Cat - Directed Protein Evolution for Synthetic Biology and Biocatalysis Abstract: ES-Cat will use directed evolution as a tool to reproduce Nature's remarkable ability to generate molecular machines - in particular enzymes – that perform at levels near perfection. Instead of seeing rational and combinatorial approaches as alternatives, we combine them in this network to achieve a ‘smarter’ and more efficient exploration of protein
sequence space. By harnessing the forces of Darwinian evolution and design in the laboratory we want to (i) screen large and diverse libraries for proteins with improved and useful functions, (ii) optimize existing proteins for applications in medicine or biotechnology and (iii) provide a better understanding of how existing enzymes evolved and how
enzyme mechanisms can be manipulated. This Network brings together leading academic and industrial groups with diverse and complementary skills.

"Title: NHNME - Networked Holiness: New Media Entrepreneurship of Catholic Monastic Communities Abstract: In answer to the secularization and Islamization of Europe, traditionally perceived as the main stronghold of Christianity, Pentecostal and Charismatic groups from South America and Africa are today planning the re-evangelization of the “old continent”. Indeed, in the last three decades these regions have served as hubs for the development of new forms of proselytization based on new media and smart technologies. Leveraging new media expertise, new monastic communities of religious media managers (hereafter MCMMs) have become actors of primary importance in both established institutions, such as the Catholic Church, and the global religious market at large. The overall aim of the proposed research is to advance my career through the completion of the present research project, which examines the rise of the use of online video for proselytization purposes and the emergent role of MCMMs in organized religious institutions. From online sermons to ISIS beheadings, online video-sharing platforms are today a central arena in which MCMMs of different faiths compete for users' attention and attempt to disseminate their religious creeds. This raises the question: how do established religious institutions act to shape users' worldviews and renegotiate authority on a global level via online video-mediated communication? To investigate the ways that religious institutions construct users' experience and negotiate its meanings on new media platforms, the study focuses on the Canção Nova's online activities. Drawing upon the legacies of both Semiotics and Sociology of Religion, this study proposes an innovative socio-semiotic approach which combines semiotic analysis of video with web content analysis and workplace ethnography.

The new Shaping, Debinding and Sintering (SDS) process for Rare Earth magnets is an innovative automated manufacturing route to realise complex 3D- and multilayered parts; resulting in a significant increase in the material efficiency of at least 30% during manufacturing; while at the same time allowing additional geometrical features such as threads, cooling channels, small laminations/segments (e.g. to increase the efficiency of electrical motors) and structural optimisations such as lightweight-structures or the joint-free realisation. As part of the project, the possibility to produce hybrid parts such as an improved moving-coil transducer for headphones, loudspeakers and microphones will be evaluated.
The SDS process allows a new level of sustainability in production, as the energy efficiency along the whole manufacturing chain can be increased by more than 30% when compared to conventional production routes. Moreover, the used raw material is 100% recycled and can be again recycled in the same way at the end of the lifetime of the products. In short, the innovative REProMag SDS process has the potential to manufacture complex structures of high quality and productivity with minimum use of material and energy, resulting in significant economic advantages compared to conventional manufacturing.
The REProMag project is a highly innovative combination of applied research, technology development and integration, resulting in small-scale prototypes and a closely connected demonstration activity clearly showing the technical feasibility of the REProMag SDS processing route in a near to operational environment.",True
"Title: INSTINCT - Inhibiting Stress in the Construction Industry Abstract: Work-related stress is costing the UK economy about 10 million man-hours and €16 billion. An intervention to curb the advent of stress is proposed: ‘Stress-Blocker’ (Streblo). Cognitive psychology identifies five main personalities (Big-5): extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness. How these Big-5 differ in the dynamics of stress are unexplored, particularly in the field of construction where stress is also prevalent. Behavioural science explains differences in the coping abilities of people. Thus Part A of the study is an empirical investigation of the impacts of stressors on the Big-5 and their different coping behaviours. Data from at least 1500 UK construction personnel will be collected using a questionnaire, and analysed using multiple inferential statistical techniques: hierarchical regression, factor analysis and sequential equation modelling. The findings will then inform Part B: the development of Streblo, a cloud-based IT tool for the effective recognition and deterrence of stress. Streblo will operate on artificial intelligence and its initial simulation will be carried out using of the WEKA software. Data from 1200 respondents will be used to train Streblo while the remaining 300 pseudo responses will be used to pilot (validate) the performance of the product. Streblo will also be validated with the partner organisations and project managers, through focus group meetings which will be recorded, transcribed and analysed using the ‘Nvivo’ software. Streblo will then be launched as a simple, quick-to-use and free IT app which will be accessible on mobile devices, PCs and laptops. Streblo will exploit advanced technologies to prevent stress in different construction job profiles as well as other sectors of the economy. It will be the first worldwide integrated system that is based on personality profiling and associated coping skills to empower individuals to manage event-related stress in the context of their job roles.",True
"Title: Exile and Technology - Austro-German exile in America 1930-45: interrogating the relationship between science, technology and modern selfhood in cultural and musical discourses. Abstract: This project examines the relationship between technology, selfhood, and modernity in the context of the music and thought of Austrian and German émigré musicians and cultural theorists in America from 1930 to 1945. The project looks beyond the boundaries of the nation state and the nexus of composer and musical work that tend to structure musicological enquiry. Instead, transnational historical methodologies will be used alongside primary archival research to join a timely conversation in musicology about the intersections between histories of music and science. In the era 1930-45, (Austro-)Germany and America were scientific powerhouses. Against the backdrop of mounting political turmoil, both generated ethically controversial scientific and technological research simultaneously liberating and malevolent: atomic technology, cosmology, radar, eugenics, transportation innovations. Technology necessarily shapes ideas of selfhood, and the mass displacement of Austrian and German intellectuals to the US after the rise of the National Socialists created a ‘culture of exile’ in which, as émigrés integrated within the new context, diverse attitudes to the relationship between science, technology, and formulations of the self began to interweave. Using musical collaborations, spectacles, and events to illuminate and explore the range and ambivalence of those attitudes, the project will furnish a more finely grained historical understanding of the disconnections between Germanic and American relationships to technology and selfhood in the period. The research outcomes during the fellowship will be a monograph, and two articles as part of substantial work on a second book. A further key objective will be to establish an international interdisciplinary academic network in the US, UK, and Germany for collaborative projects and conferences exploring technological and cultural/musical discourse, exile, and international mobility in the first half of the twentieth century.",False
"Title: ENCAP4HEALTH - Innovative sustainable ENCAPsulation systems for improving human HEALTH and well-being Abstract: Improvement and maintenance of health, particularly in ageing societies, is a major challenge defined in H2020. In this context, the objective of ENCAP4HEALTH is to develop innovative concepts for biopolymer-based microcapsules resulting in a new generation of highly functional delivery systems for functional food ingredients. Experts have emphasized for a long time that new methods and materials are required to improve functionality, digestibility and absorption of these so-called bioactives. With an increasing awareness for zero-waste production and reduction of the environmental impact of food processing, opportunities to create a new generation of encapsulation systems open up. ENCAP4HEALTH will bring together more than 50 international experts with ample expertise from 12 different institutions (technical, medical and traditional universities, SMEs and multinational companies). The network aims to identify new biopolymers and to develop more efficient and sustainable processing technologies for encapsulation. The action is divided into six work packages, three of them devoted to scientific research and three to training, career development, dissemination and exploitation as well as management. Multiple training activities related to these work packages have been specifically designed to improve the skills of the consortium members and to promote their career development. Gender aspects will adequately be addressed in training and research. Exploitation of results will boost innovation and present societal and economic benefits by producing more effective functional food applying new and optimized encapsulation techniques. ENCAP4HEALTH will lead to a greater affordability of multiple health and food applications opening market opportunities in the food sector, that will spread out to agriculture, feed, pharma and even the biomedical sector.",False
"Title: FOL - Fighting Over Land: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Colombia Abstract: This proposal aims to develop a research agenda on the long-term effect on civil conflict on institutions, particularly on land tenure structure. I start by building a theoretical model to establish the mechanisms and incentives through which actors involved in an armed conflict may be interested on fighting over the control and property rights of rural land. The resulting theoretical hypotheses will be tested using a truly unique, plot-level census data set that I digitised from Official Archives of the province of Antioquia, a Colombian region highly exposed to violence over the last fifty years. This dataset contains plot-level census data collected in 1950-55 for tax purposes. Additionally, I utilise similar plot-level census data for 1995 and 2000. These historical data sets can be easily matched to current cadastral information, available from 2006 onward. Hence, I will have comparable plot-level census datasets from Antioquia for four different periods, which coincide with the main shift of the intensity and expansion of the Colombian conflict. The exogenous nature of the different episodes of the conflict will provide the spatial and temporal variation to identify the effect of violence on land tenure. Several concerns might arise about the potential non-randomness of violence. While I cannot entirely resolve these (i.e. war is not random), I propose different strategies to test the robustness of my results. The contribution of this proposal is twofold. First, this proposal will contribute to the literature on land related conflict and the social consequences of conflict. Second, I provide technical support to many land restitution policies launched in post-conflict settings.",False
"Title: TRIANGLE - 5G Applications and Devices Benchmarking Abstract: The focus of TRIANGLE is the development of a framework that facilitates the evaluation of the QoE of new mobile applications, services and devices designed to operate in the future 5G mobile broadband networks. The framework will exploit existing FIRE facilities adding new facilities when necessary.
The project will identify reference deployment scenarios, will define new KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and QoE metrics, will develop new testing methodologies and tools, and will design a complete evaluation scheme. The project will focus on the development of a framework to ensure user QoE in the new challenging situations, especially those due to heterogeneous networks and considering the role software will have in the new 5G ecosystem 
The framework as value added will also provide the means to allow certification and quality mark for the applications, services and devices compliant to the requirements and test specifications developed in the project but also extensible to other FIRE test solutions.

"Title: EvoConBiO - Uncovering and engineering the principles governing evolution and cellular control of bioenergetic organelles Abstract: ""Complex life on Earth is powered by bioenergetic organelles -- mitochondria and chloroplasts. Originally independent organisms, these organelles have retained their own genomes (mtDNA and cpDNA), which have been dramatically reduced through evolutionary history. Organelle genomes form dynamic populations within present-day eukaryotic cells, akin to individuals co-evolving in a """"cellular ecosystem"""". The structure of these populations is central to eukaryotic life. However, the processes shaping the content of these genomes through history, and maintaining their integrity in modern organisms, are poorly understood. This challenges our understanding of eukaryotic evolution and our ability to design rational strategies to engineer bioenergetic performance.

EvoConBiO will address these questions using a unique and unprecedented interdisciplinary approach, combining experimental characterisation and manipulation of organelle genomes with mathematical modelling and cutting-edge statistics. This highly novel combination of experiment and theory will drive the field in a new direction, for the first time uncovering the universal principles underlying the evolution and cellular control of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Our groundbreaking recent work on mtDNA suggests a common tension underlying organelle evolution, between genetic robustness (transferring genes to the nucleus) and the control and maintenance of organelles (retaining genes in organelles). EvoConBiO will reveal the pathways underlying organelle evolution, why organisms adapt to different points on these pathways, and how they resolve this underlying tension. In addition to these """"blue sky"""" scientific insights into a process of central evolutionary importance, we will harness our findings to """"learn from evolution"""" in high-risk high-reward development of new experimental strategies to engineer chloroplast performance in plants and algae of importance in EU agriculture, biofuel production, and bioengineering.""",False
"Title: SAFEPOWER - Safe and secure mixed-criticality systems with low power requirements Abstract: Critical Real-Time Embedded Systems (CRTES) such as railway, aerospace, automotive and energy generation systems face a disruptive challenge caused by the massive irruption of mixed-criticality systems based on multicore processors. At the same time  low-power is an intensifying demand in many market segments, a competitive advantage for CRTES that have to operate with limited energy (e.g., battery powered systems), an enabler for higher availability  and a desired feature towards near-zero emission in systems with tens/hundreds of devices. Power is also a key aspect in mixed-criticality systems as another resource (together with time and space) that has to be shared among different applications and has to be strictly controlled not to cause undesired interferences.
The main objective of SAFEPOWER is to enable the development of mixed-criticality systems with low power, energy and temperature  in combination with safety, real-time and security support by a reference architecture orchestrating different local power-management techniques. SAFEPOWER builds a comprehensive suite of multi-core platform technologies as well as analysis, simulation and verification tools for low-power mixed-criticality systems, including hardware and software reference platforms assisting the implementation, observation and test of such applications. SAFEPOWER will demonstrate the benefits through two industrial use-cases and a cross-domain public demonstrator. The safety concept of SAFEPOWER will be assessed by an external certification authority and consider reference domains and safety standards (e.g. industrial IEC-61508, railway, automotive, aerospace).
SAFEPOWE brings significant improvements w.r.t. power, energy, temperature, availability and lifetime of CRTES as well as new types of competitive products operating with limited energy. Impact and exploitation will also be facilitated by the strong collaboration  with other related projects in the cluster of mixed-criticality systems.",True
"Title: SPENG - Stretchable Piezoelectric Nanogenerators for Energy Harvesting in Elastic Environments Abstract: Nanoscale piezoelectric (PZ) energy harvesters, or nanogenerators (NGs), are vital for next-generation autonomous devices as they can directly convert small-scale vibrations, such as blood flow and body movements, into electrical energy. Scavenging power from ubiquitous vibrations in this way offers an attractive route to supersede fixed power sources such as batteries that need constant replacing/recharging. In particular, epidermal or implantable PZ NGs could revolutionize wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring. The associated elastic environments require not only flexibility of the NG, but also stretchability in order for it to remain operational. Current NGs are rarely functional without being coupled to rigid or, at best, flexible substrates, due to the lack of proper methodology for fabrication of both stretchable electrodes as well as stretchable high performance PZ nanomaterials, that together make up PZ NGs. Thus, the Action aims to (i) develop micro/nano-patterned electrode fabrication techniques based on electronic printing on flexible/stretchable substrates, (ii) develop polymer-based PZ materials with tailored elastic properties to satisfy stretchability and flexibility criteria, marking a departure from traditional PZ materials that are ceramic in nature and hence stiff and brittle, and (iii) study the efficiency of the stretchable NGs developed, based on simulations and direct measurements of energy harvesting (EH) performance in elastic environments. The Action will address pressing EH challenges such as scalability and cost of fabrication of stretchable NGs, and enhancement of energy conversion efficiency over a wide range of deformation scenarios, with an aim to broaden the application of NGs to EH in biological and other extreme environments. The Action will be implemented in a multidisciplinary and innovative research environment at the University of Cambridge, with unique opportunities for the applicant to further his academic career.",False
"Title: GAIA-BIFROST - GAIA-BInaries: Formation and fundamental pRoperties Of Stars and planeTary systems Abstract: Systems with close stellar-mass or planetary-mass companions are ubiquities in the universe. However, the processes that shape the architecture of these systems are still not understood. By 2021 the GAIA mission will provide astrometric+radial velocity orbits for millions of multiple systems. For the vast majority, GAIA will measure only photocenter displacements and not be able to resolve the individual components, preventing masses and orbital statistics to be derived.  The aim of the GAIA-BIFROST project is to exploit the GAIA sample in order to identify the processes that govern the formation and dynamical evolution of binaries and planetary systems. Using VLTI+CHARA interferometry we will resolve up to ∼6000 GAIA binaries in the continuum and in spectral lines, allowing us: (a) to derive precision dynamical masses, ages, and comprehensive orbital parameter statistics that is needed to discern between different binary formation scenarios; (b) to measure the spin-orbit and spin-spin alignment for hundreds of GAIA star-star and star-planet systems. This will constrain the origin of the orbit obliquity for stars and planets, providing unique information about their formation process and dynamical history; and (c) to image companion-disk interactions in young binary systems and use them as benchmark for studying the hydrodynamical processes that determine the system architecture at formation.  Furthermore, our survey will provide a legacy data set of dynamical masses and precision ages for (literally!) thousands of stars, by far exceeding all earlier work in these areas. This will impact many areas of modern astrophysics, including studies on stellar evolution and Galactic Archaeology. To unlock these powerful new observational avenues, it is important to resolve GAIA binaries close to the GAIA wavebands and at high spectral resolution. We will achieve this by commissioning the BIFROST beam combiner at VLTI, building on our recent successful instrumentation work",False
"Title: Playfields - Playfields: Prototyping a location based game for higher education. Abstract: The idea for this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to develop a prototype of a location-based game (LBG) that can be used for teaching fieldwork in a Higher Education (HE) setting. The rationale behind it is that location-based games, understood here as  pervasive games in which gameplay develops through a player's mobile location, are promising educational tools for fieldwork, as they:

-	Are close to student’s lifestyle as digital natives 
-	Offer innovative and creative technologies for using methods in vivo. 
-	Offers educators possibilities to monitor and supervise students’ progress 
-	Allow for different interactions between students, teachers and learning environments 
-	Allow for more creative learning processes for understanding environments and people 
-	Offer accessible and informal ways to break down barriers between researcher and “researched” 

The game we envisage to prototype will consist of an OpenStreetMap based GPS enabled mobile phone app that can be  used by students while conducting fieldwork. The game mixes spatial and qualitative approaches, that prompt students to complete certain educational tasks, plan routes , create narratives, or “claim” certain spots or areas. The app will then feed data created by the students (GPS check-ins, images, texts, recordings) back to a main computer where the findings and activities  are collected, scored with points and evaluated by the teachers of the course. Through this central interface organisers of the course as well as BOTs (automated tasks/non-playable entities in the game-world) can send messages, advise and tasks  to the participants, information that is also used to share and evaluate the results with students in the classroom. Likewise students can communicate with their supervisors while in the field through this central interface to ask for advise.",True
"Title: SuPER-W - Sustainable Product, Energy and Resource Recovery from Wastewater Abstract: In many cases energy, water and resources contained in wastewater may have significant value if recovered. Therefore, the EU is currently confronted with a paradigm shift from wastewater treatment to resource recovery. To facilitate this shift, the SuPER-W European Joint Doctorate programme trains early-stage researchers (ESRs) in developing technologies for water, energy, nutrient and metal reuse, and bioproduction from (waste)water. The ESRs obtain knowledge and skills needed to turn environmental problems into economic opportunities. SuPER-W focuses not only on technology development through research, but the ESRs are also trained in translating research into policy, creative problem-solving, identification of bottlenecks for effective implementation of resource recovery technologies, development of business cases and urban/industrial ecosystems, and assessment of sustainability and the role of public perception and policy in innovation. Furthermore, they acquire a set of commercial, entrepreneurial and managerial skills that prepare them as future leaders. All ESRs are supervised by at least 2 promoters from 2 universities and co-supervised by a researcher from a non-academic partner organisation. Moreover, they conduct an internship in the non-academic sector in the first and last project year, contributing to more effective dissemination and exploitation of their research results. To organise the training, SuPER-W brings together leading researchers from 5 renowned universities and 12 associated non-academic partner organisations, including industrial partners involved in technology development, SMEs focused on consultancy/engineering, a service provider, a government agency, and professional network organisations. ESRs who successfully defend the PhD thesis and finish the doctoral training programme receive a double or joint PhD degree, jointly awarded by the universities of his/her promoters, as well as a joint doctoral training certificate of SuPER-W.",False
"Title: FANTASTIC-5G - Flexible Air iNTerfAce for Scalable service delivery  wiThin wIreless Communication networks of the 5th Generation Abstract: 5G will have to cope with a high degree of heterogeneity in terms of: (a) services (mobile broadband, massive machine and mission critical communications, broad-/multicast services and vehicular communications); (b) device classes (low-end sensors to high-end tablets); (c) deployment types (macro and small cells); (d) environments (low-density to ultra-dense urban); (e) mobility levels (static to high-speed transport).
Consequently, diverse and often contradicting Key Performance Indicators need to be supported, such as high capacity/user-rates, low latency, high reliability, ubiquitous coverage, high mobility, massive number of devices, low cost/energy consumption. 4G is not designed to meet such a high degree of heterogeneity efficiently. Moreover, having multiple radio access technologies for multi-service support below 6GHz will be too costly.
FANTASTIC-5G will develop a new multi-service Air Interface (AI) for below 6 GHz through a modular design. To allow the system to adapt to the anticipated heterogeneity, the pursued properties are: flexibility, scalability, versatility, efficiency, future-proofness. To this end, we will develop the technical AI components (e.g. flexible waveform and frame design, scalable multiple access procedures, adaptive retransmission schemes, enhanced multi-antenna schemes with/without cooperation, advanced multi-user detection, interference coordination, support for ultra-dense cell layouts, multi-cell radio resource management, device-to-device) and integrate them into an overall AI framework where adaptation to the above described sources of heterogeneity will be accomplished. Our work will also comprise intense validation and system level simulations.
FANTASTIC-5G includes partners being active in forerunning projects like METIS, 5GNOW and EMPATHIC ensuring the exploitation of the respective outcomes. The consortium possesses the main stakeholders for innovation and impacting standardization, maintaining Europe at the forefront.",True
"Title: WATCH - Wessex–Armorica: Territories, Connections and Hierarchies Abstract: The aim of the WATCH project is to model the organisation of territories, economic and political connections, and social hierarchies promoted and sustained by maritime connections across and around the English Channel during the early Bronze Age (EBA). This study is crucial to understand how communities living in the Channel coastlands became interdependent at a time when trade in tin and copper was strenghtening the foundations for an extensive prehistoric European union. Central to the project is the study of burials within their human, social, and natural environments using Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis. The project is interdisciplinary, rooted in archaeology but borrowing concepts, methods, and data from geography and environmental sciences. This project will enable the fellow to achieve the research and transferable skills, which will allow him to become a mature independent researcher and international expert of the EBA northwestern Europe. The fellow will be able to apply the most up-to-date GIS skillset to different problems in the field of prehistoric archaeology, which will extend an exciting research career. This project offers the opportunity to the fellow to conduct innovative research and transnational mobility while providing benefits for the European Research Area, the Bournemouth University, the supervisor, the partner organisation and the fellow. This project will allow the fellow to develop a research agenda that will lead to a range of research and consultancy projects with European academic and non-academic institutions for the better understanding of EBA societies and cross-Channel relationships, thus enhancing research excellence and addressing recognized research questions in Europe, and beyond. Finally, the fellow aims to offer civil society the demonstration of how and why both sides of the Channel became socially and economically interdependent in the past is relevant to considering the future of our societies.",False
"Title: RAMBEA - Realistic Assessment of Historical Masonry Bridges under Extreme Environmental Actions Abstract: The RAMBEA project will develop a novel computational strategy for accurate and efficient simulations of historical masonry bridges subject to extreme environmental actions, including loadings induced by earthquakes and flooding. The aim is to provide a comprehensive tool for realistic assessment with the potential of transforming current practice related to strengthening of critical assets, contributing to an increased resilience of the built environment and the preservation of important elements of the architectural heritage, thus responding to the safety and socio-economic needs highlighted in Horizon 2020.
Old masonry bridges still play a critical role within the European transportation system. Moreover, they belong to the architectural heritage representing a valuable expression of past construction technology. Many of these structures are located in seismic regions and in areas subject to floods and hydrogeological instability which have been aggravated by climate change. Thus they can be exposed to extreme environmental actions which may potentially lead to bridge failure causing significant economic damage and the loss of structures with cultural and historical value. Currently, the response of masonry bridges under extreme loading is evaluated using simplified models due to the lack of efficient detailed models. However, these approaches do not allow for the complex 3D behaviour potentially leading to unrealistic and unsafe predictions. The main challenge of this project is the development of a more advanced strategy, based on a novel numerical description allowing for the 3D interaction between the different bridge components under extreme loading. More specifically, I will develop an efficient 3D finite element representation with macro-elements for the masonry parts of the bridge, an accurate description for the physical interface between masonry and backfill and an effective model calibration strategy utilising the results of non-destructive tests.",False
"Title: IoRL - Internet of Radio Light Abstract: Wireless networks in buildings suffer from congestion, interference, security and safety concerns, restricted propagation and poor in-door location accuracy. The Internet of Radio-Light (IoRL) project develops a safer, more secure, customizable and intelligent building network that reliably delivers increased throughput (greater than 10Gbps) from access points pervasively located within buildings, whilst minimizing interference and harmful EM exposure and providing location accuracy of less than 10 cm. It thereby shows how to solve the problem of broadband wireless access in buildings and promotes the establishment of a global standard in ITU. Building landlords will be incentivized to find funding to realize this solution for their properties to increase their value resulting in a stimulated market for broadband networking products in buildings, benefiting society and stimulating the world Gross Domestic Product. IoRL project provides solutions to the two main barriers to develop this broadband networking solution in buildings because it: (i) Brings together a multi-disciplinary team of research institutions and industries in a collaborative project to develop and demonstrate this vision, who otherwise would not have assembled to achieve this goal; (ii) Develops a proof of concept demonstrator, which will act as the basis for standardization of a global solution. The starting point is the joint VLC demonstrator at Tsinghua University & ISEP, the mmWave at Cobham Wireless and the NFV/SDN at NCSR-Democratos. The challenges are to (i) Develop broadband communication solutions for buildings by integrating these technologies to exploit the pervasiveness and accessibility of the existing electric light access points, the broadband capacities of mmWave and VLC technologies and the flexibility of SDN/NFV; (ii) Industrially design a radio-light solution that can be integrated into the myriad of form factors of existing electric light systems and consumer products.",True

"Title: CNT-QUBIT - Carbon Nanotube Quantum Circuits Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to use spin qubits defined in carbon nanotube quantum dots to demonstrate measurement-based entanglement in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture. The project makes use of spin-orbit interaction to drive spin rotations in the carbon nanotube host system and hyperfine interaction to store quantum information in the nuclear spin states. The proposal builds on techniques developed by the principal investigator for fast and non-invasive read-out of the electron spin qubits using radio-frequency reflectometry and spin-to-charge conversion.

Any quantum computer requires entanglement. One route to achieve entanglement between electron spin qubits in quantum dots is to use the direct interaction of neighbouring qubits due to their electron wavefunction overlap. This approach, however, becomes rapidly impractical for any large scale quantum processor, as distant qubits can only be entangled through the use of qubits in between. Here I propose an alternative strategy which makes use of an intriguing quantum mechanical effect by which two spatially separated spin qubits coupled to a single electrical resonator become entangled if a measurement cannot tell them apart.

The quantum information encoded in the entangled electron spin qubits will be transferred to carbon-13 nuclear spins which are used as a quantum memory with coherence times that exceed seconds. Entanglement with further qubits then proceeds again via projective measurements of the electron spin qubits without risk of losing the existing entanglement. When entanglement of the electron spin qubits is heralded – which might take several attempts – the quantum information is transferred again to the nuclear spin states. This allows for the coupling of large numbers of physically separated qubits, building up so-called graph or cluster states in an all-electrical and scalable solid-state architecture.",True
"Title: SmarterEMC2 - Smarter Grid: Empowering SG Market Actors through Information and Communication Technologies Abstract: Power systems undergo massive technological changes due to the ever increasing concerns for environmental and energy sustainability. The increase of RES and DG penetration is one of the main goals in Europe in order to meet the environmental targets. However these goals will require new business cases and must be based on innovative ICT tools and communication infrastructure. On parallel, following the M/490 EU Mandate, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI proposed a technical report describing the Smart Grid Reference Architecture and the Smart Grids Architecture Model (SGAM) framework. A key objective of new Research and Innovation projects should be to provide solutions and ICT tools compatible with the SGAM and the standardization activity in Europe. Such new projects should also support the standardization activity by proposing additions or changes related to their objectives. Another key issue to address is whether the existing telecommunication infrastructure is sufficient to support in mass scale the new business cases and Smart Grid services. SmarterEMC2 implements ICT tools that support Customer Side Participation and RES integration, and facilitate open access in the electricity market. These tools take into account the SGAM as well the future structure of the Distribution Network as described by the relevant EU bodies and organizations. The project supports standardization activity by proposing adaptation to data models of market-oriented standards (IEC 62325-351) and field level standards (IEC 61850). Moreover, the project is fully dedicated towards achieving a maximum of impact. To validate the proposed technologies, the project includes 3 real-world pilots and large-scale simulation in 3 laboratories.

"Title: MYCONEUTROPHILS - Elucidating the involvement of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis using a zebrafish model Abstract: Tuberculosis has afflicted humans for about 70,000 years and continues to take a huge toll on human health. The increase of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the limited effectiveness of the existing treatments make urgent a deeper understanding of its immunopathogenesis. The role of macrophages in the disease has been intensively studied, but little is known about the involvement of neutrophils. Recent findings indicate that neutrophils play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis that are unknown until the present. Thus, in this project I will use the recognized zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model, available in the host lab, to study the role played by neutrophils in mycobacterial infection. I propose to use this infection model combined with in vivo imaging of the interactions host-pathogen, gain and loss of gene function strategies, the use of zebrafish transgenic and mutant lines, gene expression analysis, and multitude of other techniques available in the host lab to study (1) how mycobacteria can evade neutrophil recruitment and phagocytosis, (2) what is the origin of the two functionally different neutrophil populations observed in mycobacterial infection, (3) how neutrophils can kill mycobacteria in the absence of macrophages and without any physical interaction, and (4) why neutrophils act as macrophage scavengers. The elucidation of all these questions never studied before will allow me to shed light on the involvement of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, and will represent a relevant improvement in the field with biomedical implications. Moreover, it will be a crucial step in my scientific career thinking of becoming a group leader in the field of immunology and infectious diseases, since I will have the opportunity to work in a relevant biomedical question, with the support of the main experts in the field, in an unsurpassable scientific environment, and with the best facilities.",False

This grant will substantially reduce the risk by securing the medium-term sustainability of the infrastructure and making it more resilient towards future challenges. The ESS has responded effectively to the ESFRI approach since it became an ERIC in 2013 and receives sizeable financial contributions from its members for core activities.

ESS-SUSTAIN-2 aims to build on that support and creates sustainability through a structural strengthening of the ESS and by future proofing the infrastructure. ESS is not seeking another few years Commission funding to keep it afloat, an approach unlikely to yield long-term sustainability (and in any event these costs are now met by ERIC members). Rather it seeks a vital helping hand to help complete the transition of the ESS into a research infrastructure that is financially sound and scientifically equipped for the future.  By developing links with the European Values Survey, establishing global partners, engaging with policy makers, harnessing technology to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness and launching the world’s first probability-based online panel, this proposal aims to give the European Social Survey the strongest possible foundation to succeed in the years ahead.",False
"Title: RICHFIELDS - Research Infrastructure on Consumer Health and Food Intake using E-science with Linked Data Sharing Abstract: RICHFIELDS
Research Infrastructure on Consumer Health and Food Intake using E-science with Linked Data Sharing

There is growing interest in consumer health as related to food, behaviour and lifestyle determinants. However, data is fragmented, key information is lacking, and the resulting knowledge gap prohibits policy makers and companies to make effective public health nutrition strategies and reformulation of food products. Making “the healthy the easy choice” requires knowledge on the context of personal life style choices of EU-citizens. 
RICHFIELDS will design a world-class infrastructure for innovative research on healthy food choice, preparation and consumption of EU-citizens, closely linked to their behaviour and lifestyle. This unique RI will bridge the gap by linking the agri-food and nutrition-health domains and account for the regional and socio-economic diversity of the EU. The RI will be instrumental to produce a scientifically reliable, technically sound and socio-legally robust evidence-base that enables scientists to efficiently collect, unlock, connect and share research data of EU-citizens. 
Consumers are central to the design: they harbour crucial information, as they increasingly adopt mobile apps and tech-wear, get access to e-business data and even medical information. Collectively, such real-life-time data create new opportunities for research, by e.g., monitoring of food-behaviour providing personalized feedback.  For further testing, detailing and underpinning and theory-building,  interfaces will be created to distributed facilities for experimental research, e.g., virtual supermarkets. Further enrichment of data is achieved via interfaces with information systems for food and health.
The consumer-focus and the scientific evidence of RICHFIELDS will, via its services, be available to (a) EU-consumers and consumer platforms, (b) stakeholders along the food chain, and (c) policy actors in the agri-food and nutrition-health domain.",True
"Title: 5G-ENSURE - 5G Enablers for Network and System Security and Resilience Abstract: 5G-ENSURE will define and deliver a 5G Security Architecture, shared and agreed by the various 5G stakeholders. It will specify, develop and release an initial set of useful and usable security enablers for 5G. These enablers will be selected for their relevance in addressing some of the foremost security concerns in order to generate the trust and confidence necessary for 5G to be widely adopted and to deliver its promises through innovative business applications. The 5G-ENSURE project will also initiate a 5G Security testbed vision and initial set-up in which the security enablers will be made available. Moreover, the potential of the developed 5G Security enablers will be showcased and demonstrated in the context of carefully selected 5G security use cases (e.g. use cases related to cybersecurity and aerospace).

Coupled with this, 5G-ENSURE will be closely linked to the overall 5G PPP programme through active participation in common activities and fora. Specifically, 5G-ENSURE will be the project that creates and animates a dedicated 5G PPP Security Working Group to coordinate the various security-related activities.

5G-ENSURE is led by a strong consortium bringing together the appropriate and complementary skills, including standards involvement and deep telco understanding, along with an extensive network of interested parties, and have a proven track-record in coordination.  5G-ENSURE will avail itself of the support of a group of international opinion leaders.",True
"Title: SeaDataCloud - SeaDataCloud - Further developing the pan-European infrastructure for marine and ocean data management Abstract: The SeaDataNet pan-European infrastructure has been developed by NODCs and major research institutes from 34 countries. Over 100 marine data centres are connected and provide discovery and access to data resources for all European researchers. Moreover, SeaDataNet is a key infrastructure driving several portals of the European Marine Observation and Data network (EMODnet), initiated by EU DG-MARE for Marine Knowledge, MSFD, and Blue Growth. SeaDataNet complements the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS), coordinated by EU DG-GROW. However, more effective and convenient access is needed to better support European researchers. The standards, tools and services developed must be reviewed and upgraded to keep pace with demand, such as developments of new sensors, and international and IT standards. Also EMODnet and Copernicus pose extra challenges to boost performance and foster INSPIRE compliance. More data from more data providers must be made available, from European and international research projects and observing programmes. 
SeaDataCloud aims at considerably advancing SeaDataNet services and increasing their usage, adopting cloud and HPC technology for better performance. More users will be engaged and for longer sessions by including advanced services in a Virtual Research Environment. Researchers will be empowered with a collection of services and tools, tailored to their specific needs, supporting marine research and enabling generation of added-value products. Data concern the wide range of in situ observations and remote sensing data. To have access to the latest cloud technology and facilities, SeaDataNet will cooperate with EUDAT, a network of computing infrastructures that develop and operate a common framework for managing scientific data across Europe. SeaDataCloud will improve services to users and data providers, optimise connecting data centres and streams, and interoperate with other European and international networks.",True
"Title: ZINCLAPS - Light-addressable potentiometric sensors (LAPS) for zinc imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution for elucidating the role of zinc in age related macular degeneration. Abstract: Light-addressable potentiometric sensors (LAPS) have great potential as a tool for functional electrochemical imaging of the attachment area of cells, providing information such as ion concentration, extracellular potentials and ion channel activity. The technique is particularly attractive for analysing cell responses of cells with planar polarisation as the cell-surface attachment area is not accessible to conventional electrophysiological measurements. However, current systems suffer either from poor resolution or slow scanning speed. In this project, we propose to develop a novel LAPS setup with high spatiotemporal resolution combined with two-photon fluorescence microscopy that allows imaging of physiological processes with submicron resolution and in real time. Novel zinc sensitive surfaces will be developed and used in conjunction with the new high-resolution and high-speed LAPS setup to investigate the role of zinc in age related macular degeneration (AMD). The retina and the underlying retinal pigment epithelium contain high concentrations of zinc. Several eye disorders are associated with altered zinc balance, and zinc supplementation has become a choice of treatment for diseases like agerelated macular degeneration. Despite its importance in health and diseases of the eye, it is still not well understood how zinc participates in cellular and molecular events and how zinc supplementation might be beneficial. We will investigate zinc fluxes at the basal side of the retinal pigment epithelium where zinc is suspected to play a key role in the formation of deposits and the initiation of AMD. The results of the study may lead to new treatments to prevent, forestall, or reverse the effects of the disease and may also help to elucidate zinc's role in other diseases including type 2 diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and Alzheimer disease and are therefore expected to impact the pharmaceutical industry and increase the quality of life for an ageing population.",False
"Title: RAPTOR - Research of Aviation PM  Technologies, mOdelling and Regulation Abstract: Particulate Matter (PM) emissions from aircraft engines adversely affect air quality in and around airports, contributing to public health concerns for airport workers and within neighbouring communities. RAPTOR will bring together relevant stakeholders to bridge a wide and multidimensional portfolio of existing European research to: 
i) provide enhanced insights into PM including the ultrafine PM (UFP) component within aircraft exhaust emissions;
ii) explore interdependencies between noise and emissions particularly NOx and UFP;  
iii)  work in association with other national and EU funded projects to determine a more nuanced understanding of the potential impact of UFP on health outcomes; 
iv) provide new insights on emission/exhaust measurement and emission modelling uncertainties; 
v) create a more comprehensive understanding on the composition and potential importance of emissions from unregulated engines; and 
vi) support the European Commission and associated Agencies to develop a coherent European roadmap for action on aircraft engine particulate matter regulation.

To achieve these ambitious goals RAPTOR will undertake an in-depth review of available literature to assess knowledge gaps. This will include non-volatile nvPM measurement techniques & corrections and their associated uncertainties as these directly impact modelling studies of local air quality and inform aircraft-induced PM related toxicity and health effects. Findings will be communicated in an open access database, highlighting interdependencies between the measurements, modelling and health disciplines. RAPTOR will forge synergistic links with existing national, EU and international projects to ensure a high degree of additionality and provide access to desensitised proprietary data. RAPTOR will also generate new data using a representative combustor rig to assess uncertainty of the current CAEP/11 nvPM standards, utilising two reference ICAO appendix 7-compliant nvPM systems.",False
"Title: KurdishWomen - From Kurdistan to Europe: Kurdish Literary, Artistic and Cultural Activism by Kurdish Women Intellectuals Abstract: Kurdish women have been involved in film production, radio broadcasts and exhibitions, as well as in the production of a substantial number of books, journals and other publications in both Kurdish and national languages of the European states. However, the aesthetic and intellectual production of Kurdish women, which leads to the empowerment of women and advancement of gender equality in the Kurdish diaspora, has not been the subject of any notable research yet. By going beyond stereotypical portrayals of Kurdish women, presented as either victim of honour-based violence or someone who suffers violent conflict, this research will deal with the gendered experiences of Kurdish diaspora from the four regions of Kurdistan (Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey) in terms of the growth of aesthetic, literary and cultural practices by migrant Kurdish women in five nation-states (Belgium, France, Sweden, Germany, UK) along with their impacts on larger societal debates within a comparative approach. It will also investigate the varying migrant incorporation regimes of selected European countries, including the impacts of the recent influx of Syrian Kurdish refugees. It includes ethnographic fieldwork, along with multi-sited research techniques carried out in the capitals of selected European states, data collection of both primary sources (creative, literary and cultural productions) and secondary sources (EU documents, annual progress reports, press releases). This study has a potential to encourage the maximization of networks of educational and intellectual revitalization in European states. It will also encourage other Kurdish migrant women to become factors of change and reach others. This is an interdisciplinary project aiming to fill in a significant gap in the relevant socio-political, gender, migration and cultural academic studies and policy debates within the European Research Area. It is in line with the EC’s strategy for gender equality provision.",True
"Title: REPLICATE - REnaissance of Places with Innovative Citizenship and TEchnolgy Abstract: The objective of REPLICATE is to demonstrate Smart City technologies in energy, transport and ICT in districts in San Sebastia, Florence and Bristol addressing urban complexity and generate replication plans in other districts and in follower cities of Essen,
Nilufer and Lausanne.
Main challenges for cities are to increase the overall energy efficiency, to exploit better local resources in terms of energy
supply and demand side measures. For successful implementation of Smart City technologies two main elements are
considered:
- Cities are the customer: considering local specificities in integrated urban plans and the need to develop monitoring
systems to extract conclusions for replication.
- Solutions must be replicable, interoperable and scalable.
REPLICATE considers also the complexity of cities, the tangible benefits for citizens, the financial mechanisms and the new
business models. The 3 pillars implemented in the pilots with the engagement of citizens, private actors and authorities are:
- Low energy districts: cost-effective retrofitting, new constructive techniques with optimal energy behaviour and high
enthalpy RES in residential buildings. Include also efficient measures in public and residential buildings: ICT tools, PV,
shading or natural ventilation; district heating is demonstrated hybridising local biomass, recovered heat and natural gas.
- Integrated Infrastructure: deployment of ICT architecture, from internet of things to applications, to integrate the solutions in
different areas. Smart Grids on electricity distribution network to address the new challenges, connecting all users:
consumers, producers, aggregators and municipality. Intelligent lighting will allow automated regulation of the amount of light
and integration of IP services via PLC.

"Title: ReaDoubt - Reasonable Doubt: An epistemological and psychological approach Abstract: The purpose of this research is to shed light on the nature and dynamics of doubt and confidence in complex epistemic decision-making, through a study of the notion of reasonable doubt. While doubt is considered a rational virtue, waiting until complete certainty before accepting and acting upon a given hypothesis is unreasonable in many contexts. Given some evidential support for the hypothesis, the threshold beyond which acceptance rather than doubt is the reasonable option seems to depend on the decisional context (particularly the cost of a possible error): jurors in criminal trials should thoroughly consider alternative scenarios before convicting a defendant; doctors or policy-makers, however, may have to take action upon less strongly confirmed hypotheses, depending on the relative costs and benefits of action/inaction. Such a decision-theoretic view of reasonable doubt relies on the assumption that the consequences of an hypothesis are exogenous to the rational evaluation of its evidential support: one first updates one’s degree of belief in view of the evidence, and then assesses whether, given the context, the hypothesis is beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. should be accepted and acted upon). But is it the case that agents’ degrees of confidence in a hypothesis, and their weighing of various pieces of evidence, are impermeable to the decisional context? Is the juror’s actual belief independent from her having to bring a consequential verdict? This research aims to study the epistemological norms of reasonable doubt, taking account of the psychological reality of the agents’ reasoning. The main objective of the fellowship is to develop an original empirical research programme, testing the effects of the consequentiality of epistemic decisions on reasoning. This interdisciplinary project requires the candidate, an expert philosopher, to acquire experimental skills and knowledge in psychology, under the supervision of a specialist in the psychology of reasoning.",False
"Title: PACEMech - The structure and molecular mechanism of transport proteins within the PACE family of multidrug efflux pumps Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is recognised as one of the greatest threats to human health worldwide. Multidrug efflux pumps play a major role in the development of drug resistance in bacterial pathogens. These pumps are able to actively export remarkably broad collections antibiotics and biocides out of the cell. Multidrug efflux pumps have classically been organised into five distinct families or superfamilies. Due to their importance, representative proteins from each of these families have been extensively studied.

Using a combination of functional genomics and biochemical methods to study antimicrobial resistance in the hospital pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, I recently identified AceI, the founding member of a sixth family of multidrug efflux pumps called the Proteobacterial Antimicrobial Compound Efflux (PACE) family. The PACE family is the first new family of efflux pumps to be described in 15 years. In light of its recent identification, there is a paucity of fundamental data describing how PACE family pumps mediate drug efflux. This proposal will apply in vitro biochemical, biophysical and structural analyses to reveal molecular details of the structure and functional transport mechanism operating in PACE family pumps.

This proposal will draw on the diverse collective expertise of my Fellowship Supervisor Prof Peter Henderson and his expert colleagues in membrane protein structural analyses and biophysics. In conducting this research I will build lasting collaborative links with these experts that will extend beyond the duration of this fellowship. I will receive specialised training in powerful membrane protein analysis methods that are essential to my career goal of establishing a leading research laboratory examining membrane transport proteins, from regulation to molecular mechanisms. My laboratory vision is to develop novel strategies to interfere with drug efflux pump function and so overcome resistance conferred by this important class of proteins.",False
"Title: YOUNG_ADULLLT - Policies Supporting Young People in their Life Course. A Comparative Perspective of Lifelong Learning and Inclusion in Education and Work in Europe Abstract: Most European Lifelong Learning (LLL) policies have been designed to create economic growth and, at the same time, guarantee social inclusion (EC 2010). First, we will study how different LLL policies are compatible with each other in terms of their orientations and objectives and how each policy considers the needs of ‘young adults’. Second, we will research the intended and unintended effects of policies on young adults. In this regard, we will look into relevant social developments such as life course de-standardisation processes and into an emerging new political economy of skills. Third, we will generate new knowledge about regional and local policymaking, with particular attention to actors, dynamics, and trends. By focusing on their regional/local context, we will elucidate the interaction and complementarity of LLL policies with other sectors of society, thus contributing to a better understanding of current fragmentation and discrepancies, in order to set parameters for future decision-making support systems. 
The project will first contribute new knowledge of the impact of LLL policies on young adults’ life courses, yielding insights on the conditions, strategies, and necessities for policies to become effective. In addition, it will provide insights on the innovations and potentials they unlock, in particular with view to informal and non-formal learning to better address vulnerable groups. Second, the project contributes to a better understanding of the structural relationships and functional match between education/training and the labour market sectors. Third, the project will provide a thorough review of regional policies and initiatives in the countries studied, laying bare distinct dynamics and trends, but also mismatches and redundancies. In particular, the project aims at identifying successful programmes in terms of sustainable solutions in integrating labour market with, social inclusion as well as their transferability to other contexts.",False

"Title: NitroScission - Electrochemical scission of dinitrogen under ambient conditions Abstract: Present ammonia synthesis, via the Haber-Bosch process, occurs in centralised facilities above 150 bar and above 400 C; it consumes a colossal 1% of our global fossil fuel consumption. Electrolytic ammonia synthesis, i.e. below 100 C and at atmospheric pressures, could be far more attractive: it would be powered by renewable energy and would take place at the point-of-consumption.   I have recently made a breakthrough, by demonstrating the first  unambiguous and quantitative evidence that dinitrogen electroreduction is possible under ambient conditions on a solid electrode, albeit at low efficiency  My aim for NitroScission is to elucidate pathways —at a molecular level— to catalyse the reaction at high efficiency. However, only the most reactive metal or metal nitride surfaces bind to dinitrogen. Such surfaces will bind even stronger to hydrogen or oxygen from water or air. To circumvent these constraints, I will use three strategies:   
(i) I will tailor the access of protons to the electrode-electrolyte interface, via in-situ deposited ionic interphases, exploiting recent advances in controlling the reactivity of electrolytes. 
(ii) I will tailor the binding to dinitrogen through oxygen-free fabrication and testing of metals and metal nitrides electrodes. By preventing air exposure, my team will gain access to a class of highly reactive electrodes, never previously tested in an electrochemical cell.  
(iii) I will use electrochemical looping, to dynamically separate dinitrogen adsorption from its subsequent hydrogenation. These experiments will be enabled by a novel method that allows us to observe gas evolution in real time.  
I will combine advanced thin film preparation methods, electrochemical tests, and in operando and ex-situ spectroscopy to establish the design principles for this important reaction. Guided by these unique tools and my scientific leadership, my team will shed unique insight into how to tailor electrode-electrolyte interfaces.",False

"Title: CUPRES - High pressure study of pairing or competing orders in high Tc cuprates Abstract: This project aims to advance our understanding of the electronic structure of high Tc cuprate superconductors. In particular,
we will use the unique combination of high pressure and high magnetic fields to study the evolution of two phases which
exist alongside the superconducting state, namely the so-called pseudogap state and a charge ordered state. Both of these
states have end points which approximately coincide with the point on the doping-temperature phase diagram where the
superconducting transition temperature is maximal and it has been suggested that fluctuations in the order parameter of one
or both of these phases could be responsible for the electron pairing that leads to high temperature superconductivity. Most
studies to date of these phase, and indeed the cuprates in general, have used chemical doping to tune the materials across
their phase diagram. Instead we plan to use pressure, which is a complementary tuning parameter which we expect to split
the accidental phase degeneracies which complicate the interpretation of the doping dependent studies. Our experimental
programme includes studies of Hall co-efficient, quantum oscillations and magnetic penetration depth to elucidate the
changes in electronic structure. We will also perform x-ray studies under uniaxial stress to correlate changes in electronic
structure to structural changes caused by the charge order.",False

"Title: Aftermath - THE AFTERMATH OF THE EAST ASIAN WAR OF 1592-1598. Abstract: Aftermath seeks to understand the legacy of the East Asian War of 1592-1598. This conflict involved over 500,000 combatants from Japan, China, and Korea; up to 100,000 Korean civilians were abducted to Japan. The war caused momentous demographic upheaval and widespread destruction, but also had long-lasting cultural impact as a result of the removal to Japan of Korean technology and skilled labourers. The conflict and its aftermath bear striking parallels to events in East Asia during World War 2, and memories of the 16th century war remain deeply resonant in the region. However, the war and its immediate aftermath are also significant because they occurred at the juncture of periods often characterized as “medieval” and “early modern” in the East Asian case. What were the implications for the social, economic, and cultural contours of early modern East Asia? What can this conflict tell us about war “aftermath” across historical periods and about such periodization itself? There is little Western scholarship on the war and few studies in any language cross linguistic, disciplinary, and national boundaries to achieve a regional perspective that reflects the interconnected history of East Asia. Aftermath will radically alter our understanding of the region’s history by providing the first analysis of the state of East Asia as a result of the war. The focus will be on the period up to the middle of the 17th century, but not precluding ongoing effects. The team, with expertise covering Japan, Korea, and China, will investigate three themes: the movement of people and demographic change, the impact on the natural environment, and technological diffusion. The project will be the first large scale investigation to use Japanese, Korean, and Chinese sources to understand the war’s aftermath. It will broaden understandings of the early modern world, and push the boundaries of war legacy studies by exploring the meanings of “aftermath” in the early modern East Asian context.",False
"Title: CHEK - deCarbonising sHipping by Enabling Key technology symbiosis on real vessel concept designs Abstract: CHEK proposes to reach zero emission shipping by disrupting the way ships are designed and operated today. The project will develop and demonstrate two bespoke vessel designs – a wind energy optimised bulk carrier and a hydrogen powered cruise ship – equipped with an interdisciplinary combination of innovative technologies working in symbiosis to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 99%, achieve at least 50% energy savings and reduce black carbon emissions by over 95%. Rather than “stacking” novel technologies onto existing vessel designs, the consortium is proposing to develop a unique Future-Proof Vessel (FPV) Design Platform to ensure maximised symbiosis between the novel technologies proposed and taking into consideration the vessels’ real operational profiles (rather than just sea-trial performance). The FPV Platform will also serve as a basis for replicating the CHEK approach towards other vessel types such as tankers, container ships, general cargo ships and ferries. These jointly cover over 93% of the global shipping tonnage and are responsible for 85% of global GHG emissions from shipping.
In order to achieve real-world impact and the decarbonisation of the global shipping fleet, the consortium will undertake an analysis of framework conditions influencing long-distance shipping today (including infrastructure availability) and propose solutions to ensure the proposed vessel designs can and will be deployed in reality. A Foresight Exercise will simulate the deployment of the CHEK innovations on the global shipping fleet with the aim of reaching the IMO’s goal of halving shipping emissions by 2050 and contributing to turning Europe into the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050 (as stipulated by the European Green Deal).

"Title: Programmable Matter - New materials enabled by programmable two-dimensional chemical reactions across van der Waals gap Abstract: Chemical reactions between solids are fundamental in areas as diverse as catalysis, information storage, pharmaceuticals, electronics manufacturing, advanced ceramics, and solar energy, to name just a few. Controlling the spatial extent of solid-state reactions at the nanoscale will enable development of materials, programmed on an atomic level, which will facilitate many emerging applications like bioinspired smart batteries and artificial synapses for future neuromorphic electronics. However, currently, there are no chemistry methods which allow precise spatial control at the nanoscale, limiting progress towards the programmable matter.   Here I propose a completely new way to create novel materials using two-dimensional (2D) chemical reactions at the atomically-defined interfaces between crystalline solids. Usually, reactions between macroscopic solids are hindered as their large dimensions prevent placing them close enough to each other to support chemical transformations. Thus, just a few years ago, the task of placing two atomically flat crystals within angstrom proximity of each other, to initiate chemical interactions between them, was impossible to realise. This situation has changed dramatically with the advent of van der Waals technology - disassembly of various layered crystals into individual atom- or molecule-thick layers followed by a highly-controlled reassembly of these layers into artificial heterostructures. Building on our recent progress in van der Waals technology, I aim to realise interplanar chemical reactions between highly-crystalline solids in precisely controllable conditions using temperature, electric and magnetic fields, light, sound, pressure, and mechanical forces as means of control. Using digital control of 2D chemistry, mechanics, and electronics at the nanoscale, I and my team will develop programmable matter that actively responds to external and internal stimuli by adjusting their properties on an atomic level.",False
"Title: ECOTIP - Arctic biodiversity change and its consequences: Assessing, monitoring and predicting the effects of ecosystem tipping cascades on marine ecosystem services and dependent human systems Abstract: The Arctic marine environment is under rapid change, both in its physical and biotic conditions. The gradual loss of sea ice, increase in temperature, invasive species and compounding effects of additional ecosystem stressors are identified as likely causes of the observed turnover of Arctic species. Other issues of concern are the climatic tipping elements that are known to have affected the region in the geologic past, and that could well affect the region in the future, precipitating a regime shift of unprecedented magnitude. Predicting these changes in the Arctic ecosystem is hindered by several knowledge gaps, particularly in terms of mechanistic understanding of the coupling between drivers and responses.  At stake are two important marine ecosystem services that human societies rely on; carbon sequestration with its feedback to global climate, and fisheries production that is the economic lifeblood of many of the local societies of the Arctic. ECOTIP will map out past and present Arctic biodiversity and its response to external drivers, and the effects of expanding commercial activities in the Arctic under expected climate change. It will investigate the resistance, resilience and persistence of key ecosystem components to multiple anthropogenic stressors, and estimate their potential tipping dynamics. It will use a  trait-based approach in process studies, empirical analysis and numerical models as a novel means of quantifying functional diversity to predict how different anthropogenic forcing scenarios (including climate, invasive species, pollution, exploitation) change biodiversity, productivity and ecosystem services. ECOTIP will engage with indigenous societies and European citizens to provide recommendations for optimizing the monitoring of Arctic biodiversity and ecosystem services, identify adaptation strategies, promote international collaboration and support Europe's endeavors to implement the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.",False
"Title: INVASIoN - Impact of invasive alien true bug species in native tropich webs Abstract: Insects can be accidentally introduced into non-native ecosystems by humans, or expand their geographical range toward the poles as a consequence of global warming. As they invade new environments, exotic species interact with local species, modifying the structure of local food webs. New associations arising from with biological invasions can impact the strength of existing links with effects cascading through trophic levels. When invasive species are herbivores that can attack economically important crops, they can cause serious economic losses. For example, recent invasion of the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) (Halyomorpha halys) in Europe and North America has the potential to interfere with local trophic webs and poses a serious threat to several agro-ecosystems. 
In this project, we will adopt a multidisciplinary approach to study the ecological consequences of BMSB invasions. In particular, we will focus on the effect of alien herbivore invasion on local natural enemies using the following work packages: 1) the impact of exotic herbivores on infochemical communication between plants, herbivores and natural enemies; 2) Learned responses of parasitoids to infochemical evolutionary traps in a climate change context; 3) Contest behaviour of local egg parasitoids for possession of co-evolved and non-coevolved hosts; 4) Patch time allocation of local egg parasitoids after alien herbivore invasion: behavioural and modelling approaches; 5) Molecular aspects of indirect plant defences against invasive and local species 6) Genetic structure of invasive alien herbivores across Europe and North America
The proposed research will be of great relevance for the RISE call as it will be an unparalleled opportunity for complementary European and Canadian research groups to join forces, resulting in the development of lasting research collaborations, the transfer of knowledge between research institutions and improving research potential at the European and global levels.",False

"Title: KNOWMAK - Knowledge in the making in the European society Abstract: KNOWMAK project aims at developing a web-based tool, which provides interactive visualisations and state-of-the-art indicators on knowledge co-creation in the European Research Area (ERA). It is structured around three integrative elements:
• Research topics, by developing ontologies around Societal Grand Challenges and Key Enabling Technologies.
• Actors, with a focus on the quadruple helix and the involvement of societal actors in knowledge co-creation.
• Geographical spaces, with a focus on multiple level metropolitan, regional, national and European spaces and their interconnectedness.
The tool combines three main data sources: established indicators of scientific and technological knowledge production based on scientific publications and patents; information on knowledge in the making derived from research projects’ descriptions; information on social innovation projects and user attention to knowledge production derived from the Internet and from social media. The integrative elements (topics, actors, space) allow for the interlinking of data items, to produce a characterisation of different dimensions of knowledge in the making.
KNOWMAK will be tailored to the needs of specific user groups with a focus on four groups: policy-makers, regional actors and representatives of the civil society, business sector, and managers of public research organisations and universities. User groups will be involved in the design of the system, the specification of the indicators and of the visualisations to be provided. This user-centred approach will ensure responsiveness of the tool to (changing) needs of relevant stakeholders in the ERA.

"Title: RETINA - Miniaturised Photonics Enabled Next Generation SAR Abstract: Photonic technologies are recognised as key enablers to satisfy the flexibility, SWaP and performance requirements of next generation EO missions. The ability of Photonics to handle high data rates and high frequencies and its easy reconfigurability is critical in this scenario, where current purely RF technologies are limited in SWaP and performance. However, the use of Photonics is currently restricted to a few demonstrations in non-critical equipment, due to their perceived immaturity compared to RF. RETINA will develop several key RF-photonic building blocks to TRL5-6, designing, fabricating and testing 1) multi-beam TTD phased array antennas for X band operation, 2) a photonic integrated beamforming network, 3) novel configuration active X-band antenna array and 4) miniaturized space-grade components and subsystems. Miniaturization will be achieved by integrating lasers and external modulators with electronics in the Tx side, integrating photodiodes, amplifiers and electronics at the Rx side and by fabricating a PIC beamformer. RETINA will integrate and demonstrate such building blocks in a test bed proving the suitability of the proposed architecture in a SAR scenario for 64 beams, demonstrating a flexible SAR payload for missions requiring flexible frequency plans and channelization and dynamic coverage operation.

"Title: JPco-fuND - ERA-NET for establishing synergies between the Joint Programming on Neurodegenerative Diseases Research and Horizon 2020 Abstract: Over 12 million people in Europe suffer from neurodegenerative diseases (ND), yet treatments that prevent or stop the progression of neurodegeneration are still lacking. Tackling this grand challenge requires enhanced coordination of national efforts to accelerate discovery. Such synergies have been created among 28 countries in the pilot EU JPI on Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND). JPND has a long standing experience in collaborative action with €75 million of additional national funds being successfully mobilized between 2011 and 2014 to support transnational research programs. The JPND Research Strategy is now ripe for further enhancement in tight coordination with the EC through an ERA-Net Cofund instrument JPco-fuND with an unprecedented commitment of €30 million of national funds associated to a highly incentivizing EC top-up fund. 
Among the most burning questions, three priority topics have emerged through a consultative process between researchers and JPND members in order to unlock several major issues within ND research: the identification of genetic, epigenetic and environmental risk and protective factors, the development and maintenance of longitudinal cohorts, the creation of advanced experimental models. These are key questions of equal priority to increase understanding of ND mechanisms that will be addressed through a common joint transnational call allowing a significant acceleration of the execution of the JPND research strategy. Moreover, to expand the impact of JPco-fuND, JPND will continue to implement other actions without EU co-funding such as aligning national research strategies, making databases more accessible and interoperable, developing enabling capacities such as supportive infrastructure and platforms, capacity building, education and training. These actions are required in parallel to achieve the highest impact for the patients, their carers and for society as whole and address this grand challenge in the coming years.",False

"Title: LOCUS - LOCalization and analytics on-demand embedded in the 5G ecosystem, for Ubiquitous vertical applicationS Abstract: Context-awareness is essential for many existing and emerging applications. Context information greatly relies on location information of people and things. But, navigation satellite systems are denied in indoor environments, current cellular systems fail to provide high-accuracy localization, other local localization technologies (e.g. WI-FI or BT) imply high deployment/maintenance/integration costs. Raw spatiotemporal data are not sufficient by themselves and need to be integrated with tools for the analysis of the behaviour of physical targets, to extract relevant feature of interests.
LOCUS will improve the functionality of 5G infrastructures to: i) provide accurate and ubiquitous location information as a network-native service and ii) derive more complex features and behavioural patterns out of raw location and physical events, and expose them to applications via simple interfaces. Localization, together with analytics, and their combined provision “as a service”, will greatly increase the overall value of the 5G ecosystem, allowing network operators to better manage their networks and to dramatically expand the range of offered applications and services. The current freedom to act on 5G system design and availability of software network paradigms and AI techniques uniquely combine in this historical moment to make it possible to radically improve the future network by endowing it with accurate on-demand localization and analytics.
LOCUS will showcase its solutions in three scenarios: Smart Network Management based on Location Information of 5G equipment; Network-assisted Self-driving Objects; People Mobility & Flow Monitoring. 
The LOCUS consortium gathers a diverse blend of high-profile partners including Operators, Vendors, IT industries and SMEs that can make its vision a reality.

"Title: RUN4LIFE - RECOVERY AND UTILIZATION OF NUTRIENTS 4 LOW IMPACT FERTILIZER Abstract: Domestic wastewater (WW) is an important carrier of nutrients usually wasted away by current decentralised WW treatments (WWT). Run4Life proposes an alternative strategy for improving nutrient recovery rates and material qualities, based on a decentralised treatment of segregated black water (BW), kitchen waste and grey water combining existing WWT with innovative ultra-low water flushing vacuum toilets for concentrating BW, hyper-thermophilic anaerobic digestion as one-step process for fertilisers production and bio-electrochemical systems for nitrogen recovery. It is foreseen up to 100% nutrient (NPK) recovery (2 and >15 times current P and N recovery rates) and >90% water reuse.
Obtained products will be >90% reused thanks to prospective end-users in the consortium and a new Business model based on a cooperative financial scheme. Run4Life impacts will be evaluated on safety and security (Risk Assessment), from an environmental point of view (Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Technical Verification), on the economy (Benefit Cost Analysis) and considering Social Risk Perception. Active measures will be developed with the support of a Stakeholders and Exploitation Panel for achieving institutional, legal and social acceptance.

"Title: ComRad - Combining MIMO Radar with MU-MIMO Communications: More than Coexistence (ComRad) Abstract: Frequency spectrum has nowadays become one of the most valuable assets, as the wireless communications devices and services are growing explosively. Realising the scarcity of the spectrum, future wireless systems are exploring the feasibility to use the spectrum that is currently occupied by radar systems, such as 3.4GHz and 5.6GHz bands used by airborne and shipborne radars. With the allocation of available spectrum to newer communication technologies, the interference in radar bands is on the rise consequently. Therefore, effective interference management approaches are needed for achieving the spectral coexistence between the current radar and communication services. More fundamentally, dual-functional systems that can simultaneously perform remote sensing and transmit useful information via classical communications could be an essential solution in the future, which not only ensures the spectral coexistence but also the improvement for both radar and communication’s performance. The goal of ComRad is to develop novel signal processing techniques for transmit and receive beamforming, waveform design, signal classification/recognition, and channel estimation, to enable the exploitation of radar spectrum for communication applications, with particular focus on 1) coexisting communication and radar systems (C-ComRad), and 2) Dual-functional Communication-Radar Systems (D-ComRad).

"Title: MOSAIC - Evolution of the Ape Forelimb: Evidence from Internal Bone Structure Abstract: ""Understanding the locomotor behaviour of our Miocene ape ancestors is critical to reconstructing the evolution of walking on two feet, or bipedalism. The Miocene (20-5 million years ago (Ma)) epoch is crucial because it is during this period that the morphological features of living great apes, including humans, were defined. In this respect, Miocene apes show unique morphological combinations that are unlike any living primate, known as """"mosaic morphologies"""", which include derived (ape-like) and primitive (generalised) features more suitable to provide a model from which bipedal fossil humans (hominins) – our direct ancestors – might have evolved. This project uses novel 3D methods (microCT scans and imaging sotfware) to conduct the first holistic analysis of the internal structure of Miocene ape forelimb bones. Bone remodels throughout life in response to load; variation in internal structure thus correlates with forelimb use and offers a more direct window into behaviour than external morphology alone. The bony joints of the forelimb on an array of extant Primate species, including apes and monkeys, will be analysed, shedding new light on Miocene ape locomotion, the evolution of living apes and the emergence of human bipedalism.""",False
"Title: ULTRACEPT - Ultra-layered perception with brain-inspired information processing for vehicle collision avoidance Abstract: Autonomous vehicles, although in its early stage, have demonstrated huge potential in shaping future life styles to many of us. However, to be accepted by ordinary users, autonomous vehicles have a critical issue to solve – this is trustworthy collision detection. No one likes an autonomous car that is doomed to a collision accident once every few years or months. In the real world, collision does happen at every second - more than 1.3 million people are killed by road accidents every single year. The current approaches for vehicle collision detection such as vehicle to vehicle communication, radar, laser based Lidar and GPS are far from acceptable in terms of reliability, cost, energy consumption and size. For example, radar is too sensitive to metallic material, Lidar is too expensive and it does not work well on absorbing/reflective surfaces, GPS based methods are difficult in cities with high buildings, vehicle to vehicle communication cannot detect pedestrians or any objects unconnected, segmentation based vision methods are too computing power thirsty to be miniaturized, and normal vision sensors cannot cope with fog, rain and dim environment at night. To save people’s lives and to make autonomous vehicles safer to serve human society, a new type of trustworthy, robust, low cost, and low energy consumption vehicle collision detection and avoidance systems are badly needed.

This consortium proposes an innovative solution with brain-inspired multiple layered and multiple modalities information processing for trustworthy vehicle collision detection. It takes the advantages of low cost spatial-temporal and parallel computing capacity of bio-inspired visual neural systems and multiple modalities data inputs in extracting potential collision cues at complex weather and lighting conditions.",True
"Title: REGREEN - Fostering nature-based solutions for smart, green and healthy urban transitions in Europe and China Abstract: Urban systems globally experience significant and interlinked societal challenges including pressures on public health and well-being and growing inequalities and social disruption. At the same time, urban systems are particularly vulnerable to impacts of climate change and suffer from degraded or lack of natural ecosystems to help alleviate these impacts. A promising approach to deal with these challenges is to work with nature’s capacity and qualities in a sustainability perspective. Working with nature in urban settings has advantages over other approaches: multi-functionality, multi-benefits and cost-effectiveness. Nature Based Solutions (NBS) are interventions that seek to restore, improve, enhance or conserve natural capital and biodiversity in terms of habitats or ecosystems. Subsequently, these ecosystems provide enhanced multiple ecosystem services that contribute to social and economic benefits, reducing the urban societal challenges. They can help build climate resilience in cities, improve liveability, and in collaboration with other urban priorities contribute to building inclusive communities, closing social equality gaps, while promoting innovative businesses and jobs.  The aim of Regreen is to generate evidence for how Nature-based solutions (NBS) underpinned by improved urban governance, and public and private participation can systematically integrate ecosystem services and biodiversity and advocate their benefits and values in urban planning to meet societal challenges including climate change resilience, public health and well-being, and social inclusion.

"Title: Disc4All - Training network to advance integrated computational simulations in translational medicine, applied to intervertebral disc degeneration Abstract: The European community requires early stage researchers (ESRs) who can work across the boundaries of traditional disciplines, integrating experimental and in silico approaches to understand and manage complex multifactorial disorders. This training network utilises intervertebral disc degeneration (LDD) leading to low back pain (LBP) as a relevant application for data integration and computational simulations in translational medicine. LBP is the largest cause of morbidity worldwide, yet there remains controversy as to the specific cause leading to poor treatment options and prognosis. LDD is reported to account for 50% of LBP in young adults, but the interplay of factors from genetics, environmental, cellular responses and social and psychological factors is poorly understood. Unfortunately, the integration of such data into a holistic and rational map of degenerative processes and risk factors has not been achieved, requiring creation of professional crosscompetencies, which current training programmes fail to address.

Our particular interest will be to better understand: (i) the importance of the foods available at home in childhood in influencing choices that young adults make over which foods to eat, (ii) the relevance of temptation and self-control in explaining poor nutritional food choices, and the ways that advertising might influence these behaviours, and (iii) the important interactions that exist between the ways that people spend their time (for example work and physical activity) and the food choices that they make and how this determines nutritional outcomes. 

A proper understanding of the way that preferences are formed, and the ways that they might be influenced, is key to the design of effective public policy. The food market is a good place to study these questions for a number of reasons. First, people make decisions with high frequency and in different economic conditions, which helps provide variation needed for identification of key parameters of interest. Second, we observe the same individuals making choices both for immediate consumption and for future consumption, which will also help us with identification. Third, the food industry is of considerable policy interest. People in developed countries are getting fatter at an alarming rate. To the extent that people do not take account of the effects of this on themselves in the future and on others then they are making suboptimal decisions; they and society could potentially be made better off by policy intervention, but it is important that we have a good understanding of what impact these interventions are likely to have.",False
"Title: INDUCT - Interdisciplinary Network for Dementia Utilising Current Technology (INDUCT) Abstract: Dementia raises complex challenges for people with dementia, their families, and society. The European Parliament has called for investment in high quality, innovative technology research to improve dementia care but so far there has been little benefit because research has generally been limited, small scale and methodologically flawed. In particular: the poor understanding between research and business of how people with dementia use technology means new applications are designed without an in-depth appreciation of people’s needs, preferences and limitations; there is little knowledge about practical, psychological and social barriers and facilitators to implementation making it hard to get results into practice; there is a serious shortage of research trained professionals who combine expertise on dementia care research and technology. In conjunction with INTERDEM the world’s largest network of psychosocial research for people with dementia this ITN will: develop a European multi-disciplinary, intersectoral educational research framework for Europe, to comprehensively train 15 early stage researchers (ESRs) to PhD level; provide the research evidence to show how technology may improve care and quality of life for people with dementia; and provide the European workforce with a much needed new generation of excellent research trained professionals. The objectives of INDUCT are to: determine practical, cognitive & social factors to improve usability of technology; evaluate the effectiveness of specific contemporary technology; trace facilitators & barriers for implementation of technology in dementia care. Using advanced methods in applied health research (e.g. randomised controlled trials, qualitative studies) INDUCT will provide the evidence needed to demonstrate how to make dementia care technology more usable, more effective, and better implemented in practice, culminating in an international consensus guideline for improving policy and practice.",True
"Title: RIMA - Robotics for Infrastructure Inspection and MAintenance Abstract: Inspection and Maintenance (I&M) represents a huge economic activity (450 Bn€ market) spanning across sectors such as energy, transport, civil engineering. EU hosts over 50% of I&M robotics offer but there is a bottleneck connecting it to the market and high potential applications. RIMA is a 4-year project aiming to establish a network of 13 Digital Innovation Hubs (DIH) on robotics sharing best practices and providing services to facilitate uptake of I&M technologies.
Our challenge is to reinforce this connection and to provide education and training on robotics I&M and to connect the value chain - research, technology companies, service providers, end users and investors- for accelerating economic growth in the field:
- RIMA is building upon the network pioneered by SPRINT Robotics extending it to all relevant sectors across the value chain.
- The RIMA network encompasses:
    o leading research organizations supporting one DIH per region aligned with regional policies and industry sectors.
    o Sectorial associations who will make a bridge with end users and industries.
- RIMA will offer services including support to testing and technology transfer, coaching and training on robotics for I&M, process optimization and communication. 50.5% of RIMA’s budget will be distributed to SMEs to run experiments using FSTP
- RIMA will advise on funding opportunities relying on the S3 Thematic Platform on robotics for I&M federating the common ambition of 13 EU regions.
- Network sustainability will be ensured by adapting the SPRINT business model
Expected results are (i) increased competitiveness of EU I&M Robotics, (ii) economic added value by increased productivity and availability of the critical infrastructure (iii) social and environmental impact through improved safety and less emission of hazardous substances (iv) the constitution of a sustainable and scalable (open to new members) DIH network aligned with the industrial and European policies and ambitions",False
"Title: ENVISION - Enhanced Situational Awareness through Video Integration with ADS-B Surveillance Infrastructure on Airports Abstract: The constant growth of air traffic will put regional and local airports under ever more pressure for increasing their capacity. However, safety and efficiency gains allowed by the deployment of A-SMGCS systems currently remain out of most small to medium size platforms’ reach because of prohibitive infrastructure costs. Due to the intrinsic attributes of current surveillance technologies and airport surface coverage constraints, airports are required to deploy complex and costly infrastructures involving multiple sensors of different kinds: ADS-B, MLAT, SMR.

ENVISION is an ATM application-oriented research project, under the SESAR 2020 Programme “Enabling Aviation Infrastructure: CNS” topic which aims at making use of technical progress in CCTV cameras, LIDAR technology and image processing techniques, and at taking advantage of reduced equipment costs, to provide regional and local airports safe and affordable surface movements surveillance capabilities for ATC and A-CDM services.

In a stepwise approach, in two airports, the consortium will evaluate and demonstrate the operational, technical and economic feasibility of implementing CCTV and LIDAR technology in complement of ADS-B on the airport surface in providing identification and positioning data in A-SMGCS. Additionally, the project will assess the benefits of using this technical solution to feed A-CDM (Airport Collaborative Decision Making) milestones and provide a surveillance display to airport stakeholders.",True
"Title: GalRepsDiophantine - Galois Representations and Diophantine Problems Abstract: Wiles' remarkable proof of Fermat's Last Theorem paved the way for the modular approach to Diophantine equations. This associates a Frey elliptic curve to a putative solution of a Diophantine equation and studies it using Galois representations and modularity. This proposal is organized around two research programmes, both of which develop new tools for the modular approach. The first is concerned with distinguishing Galois representations; this is currently the most frequent obstruction to the success of the approach. The second aims to prove modularity and irreducibility theorems for abelian varieties of GL2 type. Such theorems are of tremendous independent interest, but will also allow the replacement of Frey elliptic curves with Frey abelian varieties giving the modular approach immense flexibility.

The University of Warwick has a strong and active number theory group, making it a natural host for the project. The Supervisor, Professor Siksek, is a leading expert on curves, rational points, Diophantine equations and modularity, with considerable experience in supervising research including eight postdocs and ten completed PhD students.

The Researcher, Dr Freitas, did his undergraduate studies in Lisbon, and his PhD at the University of Barcelona. He has worked for almost three years in Germany (Bonn and Bayreuth), and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver). He has a successful track record of research in modularity and Diophantine equations, with 12 papers already published or accepted in excellent journals. He was awarded the prestigious 2014 Jose Luis Rubio de Francia prize by the Spanish Mathematical Society. The envisioned research will make the Researcher influential in Diophantine equations and adjacent subjects. The project will reintegrate him into the European research environment, and allow him to realize his ambition of becoming an independent researcher at a leading European institution.",False
"Title: INDEED - Innovative Nanowire DEvicE Design Abstract: Nanowires (NWs) exhibit unique properties that make them potential building blocks for a variety of next generation NanoElectronics devices. Recent advances have shown that NWs with predefined properties can be grown, offering a new paradigm enabling functional device prototypes including: biosensors, solar cells, transistors, quantum light sources and lasers. The critical mass of scientific knowledge gained now needs to be translated into NW technologies for industry. FP7-MC NanoEmbrace (ITN) and FUNPROB (IRSES), made substantial contributions to NW research, producing excellent scientific and technological results (>100 journal papers published) and delivered outstanding training in nanoscience and transferable skills to ESRs.

Despite demonstrable scientific and technological advantages of NWs, NW-based technology concepts have not yet been translated into market-ready products, because industry and academia have not worked hand-in-hand to commercialize the research findings. Thus, it is essential that NW research is now directed towards customer-oriented scientific R&D; whilst applying innovative industrial design techniques to ensure rapid translation of the basic technologies into commercial devices.

This ambitious challenge requires close collaboration between academia and the nascent NW industry, combining the efforts of scientists and engineers to address market needs. Building upon our previous achievements, a team of leading scientific experts from top institutions in Europe, strengthened by experts in innovative design and industrial partners with an excellent track record of converting cutting edge scientific ideas into market products has formed the INDEED network to address this challenge. To enhance employability, INDEED will train young ESRs to become experts with a unique skill set that includes interdisciplinary scientific techniques, industrial experience through R&D secondments and innovative design skills.",False

"Title: GrassrootWavelengths - Grassroot Wavelengths: Highly Networked Grassroots Community Radio through a scalable digital platform Abstract: The Grassroot Wavelengths project will create a game changing network of inclusive digital platforms for citizen engagement, community deliberation, and the free flow of information within, into, and out of discrete geographic communities by piloting solutions for connected, inexpensive, community owned and operated radio across Europe. Our approach includes features of the Living Lab and Participatory Design methods for setting up stations and services and understanding the processes in which they will be used and appropriated, along with an emphasis on synthetic speech to support the curation of audio content, thus turning data into media. Building on the success of the existing RootIO platform – with its proven commons-oriented technology and catalytic capacities for promoting/enabling collective awareness and action, participatory innovation, community resilience, and media pluralism – we will: 1) deploy and test a network of low-power community radio stations in Ireland, Portugal, and Romania; 2) work with community groups, journalists, and public good experts to develop a robust platform for expansion across Europe; 3) enhance use and accessibility of networked community radio through text-to-speech, community oriented programming applications, and other community-supported modes for contributing and managing content); and 4) work within the EU framework to establish a public support infrastructure for local ownership and revenue generation.

"Title: iBoard - Large scale interactive multi-touch displays Abstract: There is currently an established worldwide market worth annually more than $2 billion for interactive whiteboards. These whiteboards are mainly used in schools and other educational establishments. The end-users expect that a new generation of interactive whiteboards will support multi-touch finger input, yet current touch sensing solutions, while adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a large display, are striving to meet the technical specification for multi-touch interfaces. Our technology will disrupt this existing market. Alterix has invented a novel, highly efficient and low-cost electronic solution for measuring touch inputs.  By achieving a hundred-fold increase in the measurement speed compared to the touch interfaces commonly used in tablets and mobile phones, our technology scales easily to large displays with  diagonal sizes up to 250cm and is compatible with interactive whiteboards and flat-panel TVs. To serve the educational market the cost of interactive transparent TV display overlays must be reduced by replacing the indium – a critical raw material in short supply - which otherwise would be used to build the transparent sensor grid. To achieve this goal Alterix is transferring the inexpensive technology for making laminated ultrafine (nearly invisible) wires developed in the last decade for heating the windscreens of modern cars.  

It is now of strategic importance for Alterix to study the feasibility of establishing a functional supply chain, preferably within Germany and Portugal, for manufacturing TV display overlays and interactive whiteboards at the affordable cost point, validate possible issues with the manufacturing yields caused by novel aspects of the integration of large area electronics, and to articulate the company’s commercialisation plans. The outcomes of the project will help to establish a pilot production capability and to secure further investment in scaling up our business with possible support from Phase 2 funding.",True
"Title: EXACT - Identifying biomarkers of Exposure leading to Lung Cancer with Adductomics Abstract: Over 20% of death by cancer in the world are due to Lung Cancer (LC).  Tobacco, and recently, exposure to air pollution, are considered the main causes for LC, thus specific carcinogens have been only partially identified. The complex composition of tobacco smoke and air pollution makes it difficult to identify the specific compounds responsible for the carcinogenesis process. To understand the mechanisms of LC onset, methods are needed to characterize specific toxicants that people are exposed to. We propose to develop a new method to identify exposure-specific (tobacco or air pollution) markers of LC. This new method is based on the measure of the ensemble of electrophile-carcinogens and human serum albumin adducts in human serum:  the Adductome. Electrophiles present in blood are highly reactive species that have been long suspected of causing cancer because of their ability to bind DNA and proteins. Protein adducts provide more suitable markers of exposure as they have a longer life span in the blood and are present in much higher concentrations, but have been poorly investigated. In EXACT we hypothesise that protein-carcinogen electrophiles adducts can be used as markers of LC carcinogenesis and that different markers can be identified for tobacco-induced or air pollution-induced disease. Our objective is to improve the current analytical methodology for adductomics analysis and develop a new methodology for adducts structural identification in order to characterize adduct profiles in 400 samples of human serum from the EPIC cohort. Statistical analyses will be carried out to link adducts profiles to smoking status, air pollution data and methylation profiles. The elucidation of the markers structure will allow us to establish a database of candidate compounds responsible for the carcinogenicity of tobacco and air pollution. EXACT will serve as a proof of concept to develop a novel technique based on the use of the Adductome to elucidate disease causality.",False
"Title: PAINLESS - energy-autonomous Portable Access points for INfrastructure-LESS networks Abstract: The explosive growth of applications and industrial sectors that rely on broadband connectivity, is set to stretch the demand for wireless networks beyond the reach of the power grid infrastructure. Access points are being deployed on board of drones, while more than 84,000 hybrid-energy base stations are expected to be deployed annually in remote areas by 2020. Portable network nodes that are energy-autonomous and operate detached from the power grid will become indispensable in the coming applications of wireless networks. Energy-autonomy presents immense challenges for the wireless network design and imposes a complete re-think of technological solutions. PAINLESS has the visionary aim to establish a training and research platform to pioneer green, energy-autonomous portable network nodes which are self-subsistent and limitlessly-scalable, to satisfy future demands with minimal infrastructure. It promises a paradigm shift by integrating and jointly optimising wireless networks with renewable energy sources, radiated energy harvesting and airborne access points, as well as establishing disruptive performance benchmarks for the combined wireless power-and-information distribution. Our results will kick-start an innovation ecosystem for infrastructure and service providers of ICT to develop and commercialise a new generation of autonomous, sustainable and power-independent communication networks with self-organising functionality, to enable 100% coverage in urban environments in a power-efficient manner; provide network access to all types of emergency, disaster and special events areas; and connect remote / developing areas with problematic infrastructure.

"Title: MigrantLife - Understanding Life Trajectories of Immigrants and Their Descendants in Europe and Projecting Future Trends Abstract: In recent decades, European countries have witnessed increasing immigration streams and ethnic heterogeneity of their populations. Facilitating immigrant integration and social cohesion has become a major societal issue. The project moves beyond previous research by first investigating how employment, housing and family trajectories evolve and interact in the lives of descendants of post-WWII immigrants and post-1990 immigrants in the UK, France, Germany and Sweden, and how factors related to a societal context, an early life context and critical transitions shape their life histories. Second, the study will project their future life trajectories using innovative simulation techniques, considering the main life domains and diversity between and within immigrant groups. Although recent studies report substantial diversity in employment, in housing and in family patterns among descendants of post-war immigrants and recent immigrants in Europe, the causes of this heterogeneity remain far from clear. Furthermore, it is not known whether observed differences between immigrants and natives are short-term outcomes in a long-term process of cultural and economic integration or rather reflections of different pathways and outcomes for immigrants and their descendants. The project will exploit large-scale longitudinal data from four countries and apply advanced longitudinal methods, including multichannel sequence analysis and multilevel event history analysis. Microsimulation will be applied to project life histories for immigrants and their descendants. The project will significantly deepen our understanding of the relationships between the three life domains, and the causes of less and more successful life trajectories among immigrants and their descendants. This project will show whether the current heterogeneity between and within immigrant and minority groups vanishes over time or rather persists, suggesting an increasing diversity of European societies.",False
"Title: CITYLAB - City Logistics in Living Laboratories Abstract: Goods, waste and service trips in urban areas impose negative traffic and environmental impacts, and there is a need for further roll-out of cost-effective and sustainable solutions. The CITYLAB objective is to develop knowledge and solutions that result in roll-out, up-scaling and further implementation of cost effective strategies, measures and tools for emission free city logistics in urban centres by 2030. The project focuses on four axes for intervention due to their present and future relevance and impact related to topic MG-5.2 objectives: 1) Highly fragmented last-mile deliveries in city centres; 2) Large freight attractors and public administrations; 3) Urban waste, return trips and recycling; 4) Logistics facilities and warehouses. CITYLAB will i) improve basic knowledge and understanding on areas of freight distribution and service trips in urban areas that have received too little attention; ii) test and implement 7 innovative solutions that are promising in terms of impact on traffic, externalities and business profitability and have a high potential for future growth; and iii) provide a platform for replication and spreading supported solutions. The core of CITYLAB is a set of living laboratories, where cities work as contexts for innovation and implementation processes for public and private measures contributing to increased efficiency and sustainable urban logistics. Linkages will be established between the different living labs for exchange of experiences and to develop methodologies for transfer of implementations between cities and between companies. This process will be supported by a strong research team. The outputs from the living labs will include best practice guidance on innovative approaches and how to replicate them. CITYLAB will lay the ground for roll-out, up-scaling and transfer of cost-effective policies and implementations that lead to increased load factors and reduced vehicle movements of freight and service trips in urban areas.",False
"Title: INFL - New perspectives on inflation Abstract: The research in this proposal will contribute to our knowledge of the dynamics and effects of inflation through the perspective of risk-adjusted inflation and valuation formulas. The goal is to provide new perspectives on inflation and its impact on
resource constraints.

The first step in this work is to collect new data on inflation options and use them to construct marginal densities for risk-neutral inflation at different horizons. Because there are data for both cumulative and annual inflation, I propose a new non-parametric estimator of the joint distribution of inflation. This provides a new take on inflation dynamics and the anchoring of inflation expectations.

The second step is to use these densities as discount factors to price nominal claims. Applying these to the assets and liabilities of a central bank gives a measure of the fiscal capacity of the central bank and the impact of a higher inflation target.

The third step combines the densities for inflation with nominal interest rates to gauge how much society dislikes inflation. The risk-neutral densities give inflation strips that reveal how much markets would be willing to pay to eliminate inflation risk.

The fourth step is to design inflation-indexed bonds that allow countries to self-insure in a currency union. Understanding how the value and payments of these bonds changes with different measure of inflation, a country can insure itself against some of the shocks that affect its real exchange rate.

The fifth step is to design new liabilities of the central bank that allow for a better control of inflation. By issuing inflation-indexed reverses and maintaining the commitment to redeem them one-to-one for currency at all date, the central bank can control inflation. 

All together, these different projects aim to deepen our understanding of inflation, by focusing on modeling risk-adjusted inflation, to answer old questions and suggest new approaches in monetary economics.",False
"Title: FICTSTRUCT - Fictionalist Mathematical Structuralism Abstract: ""Mathematics is ubiquitous throughout the sciences and in everyday language and thought. Its applications across all disciplines - science, economics, engineering, computing and more - are central to the future development of a robust, creative, and driven society. The abstract character of mathematics raises difficult philosophical questions about the nature of mathematical entities (such as numbers, functions, and sets), how we have knowledge of such entities, and how they can be applied in the real world. This research project tackles such questions by integrating two perspectives in the philosophy of mathematics, viz. """"mathematical structuralism"""" and """"mathematical fictionalism"""". Both structuralism and fictionalism capture important aspects of how many working mathematicians approach their practice. But in contemporary philosophy of mathematics, structuralism and fictionalism are widely thought of as presenting competing views of the nature of mathematics. In contrast, this project will develop a new theory of mathematical structure that unifies structuralism and fictionalism, thereby shifting the debate and promoting new and fruitful lines of research in the philosophy of mathematics and mathematical practice. Crucially, this research will be informed and supported by interdisciplinary discussions of mathematical practice with mathematicians, mathematical scientists, linguists who work on meaning and reference, and psychologists whose research focuses on mathematical cognition. Drawing on aspects of their research, this project will build a new and distinctive positive theory of the nature of mathematics. With this comprehensive theory established, the project will show how it can be deployed to make progress on long-standing problems in the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science.""",False

"Title: BeePath - Impact of vector-mediated transmission on the evolution and ecology of a bee virus Abstract: The emergence of novel transmission routes is likely to have profound impacts on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, with potentially dramatic effects on host populations. This might be particularly drastic when transmission changes from direct to vector-borne transmission, where prevalence and virulence are expected to increase. Despite its importance for disease control, we lack empirical and theoretical understanding of this process. The emergence of Varroa destructor in honeybees provides a unique opportunity to study how a novel vector affects pathogen ecology and evolution: this ectoparasitic mite is a novel vector for Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), a disease linked to severe increases in hive mortality. To study the fundamental evolutionary ecology of emerging vector-borne diseases, I will exploit a unique natural experiment, the presence of Varroa-free island refugia, to test how this novel vector affects epidemiology and evolution in the field. I will adapt cutting-edge single molecule sequencing to guide  controlled lab experiments by viral evolution in the wild, establishing novel reverse genetics approaches in DWV to test causal links between phenotypic and molecular evolution. Like all emerging diseases, DWV is a multi-host pathogen that also infects wild bee species not infested by Varroa, such as bumblebees. This raises an additional question, highly relevant for zoonotic diseases: does this specialist honeybee vector impact disease in wild bee populations? I will model the impact of vector acquisition and evolving pathogens on host populations and test potential prevention and mitigation strategies to safeguard these crucial pollinators. This system will not only provide fundamental insights into the evolutionary ecology of disease, but is also of immediate applied importance: bees are key pollinators of crops and wildflowers, and halting population declines facilitated by infectious disease is crucial for food security and biodiversity.",False
"Title: SCOPE - Surface-COnfined fast-modulated Plasma for process and Energy intensification in small molecules conversion Abstract: The SCOPE project will introduce a ground-breaking approach to use renewable energy in three major industrial reactions: 1) N2 fixation, 2) CH4 valorization and 3) CO2 conversion to liquid solar fuels. We will use non-thermal plasma, which has large potential to convert these small (low reactive) molecules under near ambient temperature and pressure, particularly for distributed processes based on renewable energy. The new processes have drastically lower carbon footprint (up to over 90% with respect to current ones). Furthermore, CO2 conversion is crucial for a world-based distribution of renewable energy. However, the selectivity and energy efficiency of plasma technologies for these reactions are too low, making radically new approaches necessary. 

The Project idea is to realize a highly innovative approach for non-thermal plasma symbiosis with catalysis. By inducing excited states in solid catalysts to work in synergy with the excited short-lived plasma species, we introduce a brand new idea for catalyst-plasma symbiosis. In addition, we introduce a fully new concept of nano-/micro-plasma array through a novel electrode design, to generate the plasma at the catalyst surface, thereby overcoming long distance transport. By embedding ferro-magnetic nano-domains in the catalyst support and inducing radiofrequency heating, we create fast temperature modulations directly at the catalyst active sites. Combining these elements, the project will overcome the actual limits and enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency to levels suitable for exploitation. This requires a synergy over different scale elements: nano at catalyst, micro at the level of modelling plasma generated species, milli at the reactor scale and mega at the plant level for sustainability-driven opportunity guidance and impact assessment by Life-Cycle-Assessment. The synergy value derives from the integration of the PI competencies over this entire dimensional-scale level.",True
"Title: ProtCap - Protein Capsules Abstract: In the ProtCap project, we will translate basic technology, developed in the context of the ERC project PhysProt, towards
commercial applications. The technological focus will be on microscapsules assembled through microfluidic techniques
from natural proteins. Encapsulation increasingly underlies the storage and formulation of active components and is a
growing market which impacts areas from cosmetics to personal health-care. In this context, synthetic polymers are the
standard material for forming the shells of microcapsules and other encapsulation platforms. We propose an orthogonal
approach through the use of fully natural building blocks, proteins. Proteins are the fundamental building blocks of life,
underpinning the formation of sophisticated materials and structures in nature through self-assembly. We have been able to
demonstrate the ability to form robust capsules from a range of proteins of both plant and animal origin. This technique
allows for improvements over existing commercially available approaches in terms of biocompatible and biodegradable
products, and ability to undertake all processing steps under mild conditions in aqueous solution for processing sensitive
cargo species. In the present project, we will establish the viability of the protein capsule technology in particular sectors
and generate connections with key industrial players based on initial contacts established so far. A key component of this
approach is the proposed work to demonstrate the encapsulation of technologically important high value cargo materials, a
translational step which will allow us to move towards forging partnerships, and explore licensing of IP to existing industrial
partners in the context of this project, or through providing the basis for setting up a dedicated entity to take forwards the

Beside this, the ubiquitous presence of smartphones with their cameras and NFC readers will create the perfect bridge between everyday users and their objects. This will create a completely new flow of crowdsourced information, which extracted from the objects and enriched with user data, can be exploited by new services. 

TagItSmart will create an open, interoperable cloud-based platform with all the tools and enabling technologies, which will address the challenges related to the lifecycle management of new innovative services capitalizing on objects “sensorization”. TagItSmart will empower all steps involved from creating smart markers, Functional Codes (FCs), to supporting secure and reliable acquisition and consumption of such contextual data, while preserving user privacy, to the provision of generic functionalities and a service composition platform which will allow even inexperienced users to create and deploy their FCs based services while maintaining system efficiency.

To boost the platform adoption, a set of industrial use cases will be used as a baseline for development, while additional stakeholders will be engaged through a co-creation Open Call approach. A carefully planned engagement activity will ensure the establishment and sustainable expansion of the TagItSmart ecosystem fostering long term innovation and exploitation capabilities well beyond the project duration.",True
"Title: CYTO-WATER - Integrated and portable image cytometer for rapid response to Legionella and Escherichia coli in industrial and environmental waters Abstract: The proposed project will deploy for the first time a new imaging cytometer platform capable of detecting minute quantity of micro-organisms in industrial and environmental waters. The platform is based on the integration of proprietary technologies available to the consortium partners: an automatic water concentration cartridge combined with a microfluidic cell will provide an adequate sample to a newly designed fluorescence image cytometer whose readings will be recorded and processed using a proper software interface. It will be validated for quantifying Legionella and Escherichia coli (E. coli) population within 120 minutes from obtaining the sample, overcoming in this way the main disadvantage of traditional methods used in laboratories, i.e. long time-to results which can currently last up to 12 days in the case of Legionella and 1 day for E. coli. The targeted detection limit will be 10-100 cells/L and 5-20 cells/100 mL for Legionella and E.coli, respectively. Also, the new imaging cytometer will have a portable form, a size similar to a smart-phone, which will increase its versatility and widen the possibilities of onsite applications. The relevance of the project is clear when one thinks about the high risk of legionellosis in some specific industrial environments, such as cooling waters, evaporative condensers and air conditioning systems and the fact that E. coli is one of the faecal pollution index commonly analyzed for monitoring the presence of waterborne pathogens and hence the quality of bathing waters. From a market perspective, more than 7 million of Legionella analyses are performed annually in Europe while E. coli level is included in all bathing water regulations in different EU countries. CYTO-WATER clearly falls into HORIZON 2020 topic WATER-1-2014/2015: Bridging the gap: from innovative water solutions to market replication and addresses Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and in the Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC).",True

"Title: MILLET - Old crops for new insights: agricultural systems of broomcorn and foxtail millet cultivation in Iberia Abstract: In the middle of the second millennium BC, the spread of two new Asian crops (broomcorn and foxtail millet) throughout Europe led to major socio-economic changes. However, despite its abundance in archaeological sites, we know very little about its cultivation techniques and uses. Millets can be traced through multiple archaeological approaches (seeds, phytoliths, biomolecular markers) providing great potential for their investigation. In order to understand their importance in agricultural systems this project aims to produce new evidence from modern and archaeological samples from western Europe. To provide innovative perspectives, the project will focus on an interdisciplinary approach that combines ethnobotany, archaeobotany, stable isotopes and experimental agriculture to reconstruct cultivation techniques and environmental constraints. Combining stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values with functional weed ecology – an approach pioneered at Oxford – will allow detailed reconstruction of growing conditions and production regimes. The fellow will receive training in these techniques, which will enable comparison between present-day millet-growing systems and archaeobotanical assemblages from 24 sites in the Iberian peninsula. Determining the agroecology of millet cultivation will provide a fresh perspective on current theories regarding their adoption in late prehistory and will contribute to major advances in the study of past and present-day farming systems. The results will also articulate with work on climate change, food, genetic diversity and sustainability associated with traditional knowledge, placing this research at the forefront of the current scientific context of agrarian studies.",False

This requires developing 5G infrastructures to address a wide range of applications adopting flexible architectures, offering converged services across heterogeneous technology domains with unified software control. However, vertical industries today can only verify use cases in small scales in commercial environments, before investing in large scale deployments. Through ICT-17 projects 5G infrastructures become available to verticals to test their applications, however large-scale trials are still not possible. 5G-VICTORI will conduct large scale trials for advanced vertical use case verification focusing on Transportation, Energy, Media and Factories of the Future and cross-vertical use cases. It leverages 5G network technologies developed in 5G-PPP Phase-1 and Phase-2 projects 5G-XHaul and 5G-PICTURE and exploits extensively existing facilities interconnecting main sites of all ICT-17 infrastructures i.e. 5G-VINNI, 5GENESIS and 5G-EVE and the 5G UK test-bed in a Pan-European Infrastructure. The project will provide enhancements of existing infrastructures towards integration of a large variety of vertical and cross-vertical use cases. 5G-VICTORI’s platform aims to transform current closed, purposely developed and dedicated infrastructures into open environments where resources and functions are exposed to ICT and vertical industries through common vertical and non-vertical specific repositories. These functions can be accessed shared on demand and deployed to compose very diverse set of services in a large variety of ecosystems. 5G-VICTORI’s uniquely strong consortium brings together major players form ICT including operators, equipment vendors academic and research organisation and SMEs as well as main players from vertical industries including nationwide rail and electricity operators, rail technology vendors, media content delivery players and a number of SMEs focusing on advanced vertical services.",True
"Title: L3Pilot - Piloting Automated Driving on European Roads Abstract: The overall objective of the L3Pilot project is to test the viability of automated driving (AD) as a safe and efficient means of transportation, exploring and promoting new service concepts to provide inclusive mobility. This high-level objective is detailed as four major technical objectives: (i) create a standardised Europe-wide piloting environment for automated driving (ii) coordinate activities across the piloting community to acquire the required  data (iii) pilot, test, and evaluate automated driving functions and connected automation (iv) innovate and promote AD for wider awareness and market introduction. The European automotive sector must remain competitive in vehicle automation in the face of increasing competition from the US and Asia. Only by joining forces in pilot testing and evaluation of AD systems with real users will European industry meet the challenge coming from overseas. The project will focus on large-scale piloting of SAE Level 3 functions, with additional assessment of some Level 4 functions. The functionality of the systems used is exposed to variable conditions in 11 European countries, 100 vehicles and 1000 test drivers. The approach will be to adapt the FESTA methodology for testing automated driving needs. The tested functions cover a wide range from parking to overtaking, and urban intersection driving. Due to its large coverage of driving situations, L3Pilot is unique, and the first project which will demonstrate and test such a comprehensive menu of automated driving functions. The data collected will also be made available for third parties outside the consortium, for further use. The evaluation of the data will focus on technical, user acceptance, driving and travel behaviour, impact on traffic and society.

"Title: CiViQ - Continuous Variable Quantum Communications Abstract: The goal of the CiViQ project is to open a radically novel avenue towards flexible and cost-effective integration of quantum communication technologies, and in particular Continuous-Variable QKD, into emerging optical telecommunication networks.

CiViQ aims at a broad technological impact based on a systematic analysis of telecom-defined user-requirements. To this end CiViQ unites for the first time a broad interdisciplinary community of 21 partners with unique breadth of experience, involving major telecoms, integrators and developers of QKD. The work targets advancing both the QKD technology itself and the emerging “software network” approach to lay the foundations of future seamless integration of both. The technological advantage will more specifically aim to:
- Design architectures and implement protocol extensions of flexible “software based” networks for midterm country-wide QKD reach.
- Drive CV-QKD systems and components up to TRL 6, derive standardized set of interfaces, also allowing a network-aware software defined functionality and open modular development, and pursue cost reduction by seamless integration of off-the-shelf components.
- Push CV-QKD performance boundary forward by developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits (PIC) for CV-QKD, i.e. opening the way for ultra-low cost systems, and improve further the CV-QKD hallmark coexistence capability with standard WDM channels, i.e. reducing dramatically the barriers to optical network co-integration.
- Prepare actively for next-generation networks by developing core enabling technologies and protocols aiming at quantum communication over global distances with minimal trust assumptions.

CiViQ will culminate in a validation in true telecom network environment. Project-specific network integration and software development work will empower QKD to be used as a physical-layer-anchor securing critical infrastructures, with demonstration in QKD-extended software-defined networks.",True
"Title: LENSD - Liquid Exfoliation of Nanomaterials using Spinning Discs Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have received significant attention over the past decade due to their remarkable material properties. Graphene is the most frequently studied, however a range of other 2D materials such as molybdenum disulfide and boron nitride have also demonstrated properties which will help society advance in areas from opto-electronics to sustainable energy. One of the biggest challenges currently facing 2D nanomaterials is scalable production. Current exfoliation processes are insufficient for industrial scale production due to high energy requirements, poor yield (typically < 5 wt%), introduction of material defects and low production rates (< 6 g/h). This project aims to address these process limitations. A novel liquid exfoliation approach will be investigated, using continuous flow over a spinning disc to create mono- and few-layer materials. The research activities will provide a new holistic insight into shear-induced liquid exfoliation, by experimentally and numerically examining how the fluid mechanics and multiphase transport phenomena over the spinning disc affect material characteristics at the nanoscale. The investigation involves cooperation between multiple disciplines. Experiments include the optical techniques of infrared thermography, high-speed imagery and particle image velocimetry. The researcher will receive extensive training in advanced numerical methods for simulating thin liquid films and interfacial flows at Imperial College London. Training in microscopy techniques will also be completed for the measurement of nanosheet defects and size. These research activities will assist the development of future liquid exfoliation technologies and are aligned with personalised actions to advance career development. The fellowship will broaden the researcher's technical and complimentary expertise, and facilitate inter-sectoral mobility from thermal to chemical engineering, nanotechnology and process intensification.",False
"Title: i-movo - International productisation of a disruptive digital vouchering technology Abstract: i-movo are a fintech SME, seeking funding to commercialise a disruptive vouchering technology. Our technology seeks to solve problems for consumer-facing companies such as publishers, brand-owners, retailers and loyalty scheme operators. They need to send valuable offers, reward vouchers or make cash-payments to their readers, consumers, customers or members. Previously, they may have used paper vouchers, a century-old means of accomplishing this. These are prone to fraud and slow to process, meaning retailers who accept them must wait, sometimes over many months to be paid. 
Our technical solution- Secure Digital Vouchers- are a new financial services industry payment method that can be distributed using any digital format such as mobile phones, email or payment cards. They are validated in real-time to limit or prevent over-use, fraud or viral spread and give instant feedback on the success of any campaign or activity. They are more convenient for consumers, protect the financial risk of the issuer and ensure retailers get paid promptly.
We have removed the last remaining technical barrier in the development of this market by developing a method of retail integration that requires no new software or hardware. The i-movo method uses Industry Standard payment messages so the system can be implemented anywhere in the world. To date, we have processed over 17 million transactions, worth over €350 million at over 62,000 retail outlets. We have managed over 1500 promotional and payment campaigns for over 270 customers. 
We now need to understand international markets better, in terms of stakeholders we must work with, barriers we must overcome and how best to adapt our technology for new applications.",True

"Title: DeciTrustNET - Trust based Decision Support Systems for Social Networks with Uncertain Knowledge Abstract: In real world decision-making, such as public security, social choice or recommender systems, we have a large body of data from various networked heterogeneous information sources or individuals that often conflict with each other and provide inconsistent knowledge. It is a challenging task to yield an optimal consensus decision, given the range of individual decisions obtained in terms of these knowledge sources. This research proposal aims to  create a novel mathematical and computational framework for trust based social choice in networks and with uncertain knowledge by merging multiple individuals’ preferences in an adaptive manner to reduce the disagreements among them, and automatically seek a decision or provide a recommendation with a maximal consensus.  To achieve our goal, we propose to bring together, for the first time, four previously disparate strands of research: social network analysis, fuzzy preference modelling, multiple attribute group decision-making and game theoretic modelling of malicious users. As a showcase the proposed framework will be incorporated to an e-health recommender platform to increase healthy lifestyle in cancer survivors. 
Both the fellow and the host researcher have extensive research experience in decision support system under uncertainty, e-health platforms and software and mobile development. With the foundational theory already in place, and given the growing interest in decision support systems and social networks, the time is right for pursuing this research. Being executable, this model will pave the way for an entirely new form of automated decision-support under uncertainty and incomplete information in dynamic environments and, at the same time will greatly expand the fellow knowledge and skill set, and help her to develop into a leading independent researcher.

"Title: QUSON - Quantum Sensing with Quantum Optical Networks Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits effects such as entanglement to enhance the sensitivity of measurement devices. In the last decade we have witnessed a significant advance in experimental platforms such as trapped ion setups and superconducting circuits. These systems are never free from noise and dissipation, however, interactions between qubits and photons or phonons can be controlled with lasers or external fields. Even in strong dissipative regimes, cooperative effects may induce complex quantum dynamics with emergent phenomena such as non-equilibrium phase transitions and multistability. The question then arises whether we can exploit those many-body effects in robust metrological protocols. 
My project will address this question in two main scenarios corresponding to different limits of a network of qubits coupled to photonic cavities. Firstly, I will consider a limit of weak coupling, in which cooperative radiative decay leads to the generation of entanglement. Secondly, I will investigate networks of qubits strongly coupled to photonic cavities. I will identify, and systematically investigate, points close to non-equilibrium phase transitions in which the abrupt response of the system can be used to accurately measure properties of driving fields. The project requires a rigorous theoretical description of the qubit-cavity network. Approximations such as a mean-field theory can be used for a preliminary study. However, to achieve my goals I will need to properly describe quantum correlations across the system. I will address this challenge by using Matrix Product States methods - an advanced quasi-exact numerical technique. 
My reference systems will be trapped ion setups and superconducting qubits coupled to microwave resonators. In my project, I will systematically investigate their performance as quantum sensors under realistic conditions. My work will lead to proposals for the accurate measurement of microwave fields, magnetic fields and ultra-weak forces.",True

"Title: EVACUATION - Testing communication strategies to save lives in emergency evacuation Abstract: The EU urgently seeks to improve emergency evacuation preparedness. EU public spaces are getting more crowded. Fires and terrorist attacks require emergency evacuation. Faster evacuation from public buildings during emergencies saves more lives. Observations of actual emergencies show that people tend to be slow to respond to evacuation alarms (taking up to 10 minutes) and take the familiar route out instead of the nearest exit. The EU calls for evidence-based recommendations for evacuations, which are mostly non-existent. The state of the art uses computer models of evacuation speed, but more realism is needed. We take the novel approach of combining state of the art computer modeling with insights from risk communication to improve speed and survival in emergency evacuations. This project aims to: 
1.	Identify which risky behaviors occur in emergency evacuations and underlying causes (WP1). 
2.	Use models to identify communication strategies that improve evacuation time and survival (WP2). 
3.	Test communication strategies for improving evacuation time and survival in experiments (WP3).
To ultimately save lives, Aim 1 involves (a) observing behavior in existing videos of actual evacuations, and (b) interviewing emergency service members about their experiences in actual evacuations. Aim 2 will use ‘agent-based’ computer modeling, with which the Fellow has experience, to assess the effect of reducing the riskiest behaviors on evacuation time and survival rates. Based on the Supervisor’s expertise in risk communication and input from emergency service members, this will result in recommendations that will be tested in Aim 3 in actual evacuation drills.
Our unique team has the interdisciplinary and practical expertise needed to improve evacuations. 
Our proposed work will promote transfer between the Fellow and the team through hands-on collaborative work. The UK is an ideal testbed for our project aims, but we will inform evacuations worldwide.",False

"Title: EXO-EYE - Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes for the treatment of Traumatic and Degenerative Eye Disease Abstract: The death and dysfunction of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) is a major cause of blindness in traumatic and degenerative ocular disease. For example, 60M people are affected by glaucoma with 4.5M becoming blind in both eyes, whilst optic neuritis affects 5/100,000 people and represents a significant problem for sufferers. RGC are the sole projection neurons and their axons make up the optic nerve, making them exquisitely sensitive to injury. As CNS neurons are irreplaceable, neuroprotective strategies are paramount to therapies aimed at preserving vision but as of yet, no such therapy exists. Current research has demonstrated significant neuroprotection by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) including those from the bone marrow (BMSC), acting not as replacements for RGC but rather, as paracrine-mediated support cells. Clinical trials are already ongoing to test their efficacy in patients. Despite this, the exact mechanism behind their neuroprotective potential is not well understood. Recent studies have shown that exosomes, extracellular vesicles containing proteins, mRNA and miRNA may mediate much of the paracrine support offered by MSC and thus act as an easily purifiable cell-free alternative therapy for RGC neuroprotection. This proposal aims to assess the therapeutic efficacy of BMSC-derived exosomes, their characterisation and that of their RNA cargo. We will test these exosomes in animal models of traumatic (optic nerve crush) and degenerative (glaucoma) eye disease. Specifically, this proposal employs a novel strategy to promote RGC survival (relevant to ONC and glaucoma) and axon regeneration (relevant to optic nerve crush) through the use of exosomal delivery of mRNA/miRNA into injured RGC utilizing in vitro and in vivo injury models, RNAseq and CRISPR technology.",False

"Title: HONORLOGIC - The Cultural Logic of Honor and Social Interaction: A Cross-Cultural Comparison Abstract: Understanding (un)willingness to coordinate with others, to compromise when faced with different choices, or to apologize for transgressions is crucial as these behaviors can act as strong facilitators or inhibitors of important interpersonal processes such as negotiations and coalition building. These behaviors play a major role when individuals from different cultural backgrounds work together to solve disputes or address joint challenges. Yet, we know little about what these behaviors mean in different cultural groups or how they are approached. With HONORLOGIC, I aim to initiate a step-change in our understanding of cultural variation in these important domains of social behavior by providing unique, multimethod, comparative and converging evidence from a wide range of cultural groups. I will answer the question “How do cultural groups that promote honor as a core cultural value approach coordinating with others, reaching compromise, and offering apologies?” by integrating insights from social/cultural psychology, behavioral economics, and anthropology. I will do this by collecting quantitative data using economic games, experiments, and surveys from Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Egypt and Tunisia, as cultural groups where honor has been shown to play a defining role in individuals’ social worlds. I will also run the proposed studies in the US, the UK, Japan and Korea to provide a broader comparative perspective. 

HONORLOGIC will produce transformative evidence for theories of social interaction and decision making in psychology, economics, and evolutionary science by (a) producing innovative theory and data with an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach, (b) increasing the diversity of the existing evidence pool, (c) testing established theoretical assumptions in new cultural groups, and (d) contributing to capacity building in under-researched cultural groups in psychological research.",False

COAT provides the necessary manpower for screening new formulations and produce large-area demonstrators and illustrative prototypes to persuade major partner of the validity of the proposed technology approach for future commercialisation. To ensure these demonstrators fulfil the needs of coating manufacturers and end-users, a User Committee will be established to obtain insight and specifications on identified AR coatings and enabled applications. We will seek links with, e.g. optical component manufactures, eyeglass producers and developers of large-area photonics, such as lighting and photovoltaics. We will also work closely with curators from the London’s Natural History Museum and the Science Museum –both in close proximity to Imperial College– to include their needs with respect of art display applications. COAT personnel will thoroughly bench-mark our technology, provide a performance evaluation of the coatings and establish sustainability indicators for end-users. To clarify and protect our IPR technology, a detailed market analysis and valorisation potential of enabled applications will be undertaken. Prospects are highly promising.

"Title: TRIM - Vulnerable trait-combinations in corals and fishes and their management Abstract: Vulnerable trait-combinations in corals and fishes and their management (Traits coRals fIshes Management)

Cross-taxon interdependencies govern many key ecosystem services, e.g. pollination, agricultural production and coral reef fisheries. Many of these services are deteriorating; this is especially pressing for coral reefs. Human and climate stress drives declines of global coral reef assets, but the characteristics of the most vulnerable species groups are poorly understood.  Synergistic coral-fish relationships underpin key ecosystem functions on coral reefs, and control how coral reef ecosystems respond to climate and human stress. Emerging theory proposes that redistributions of reef species follow trait-based filtering, where species with certain combinations of traits, or functional types, are more vulnerable to stressors.  Based on biogeographical transition environments and human use gradients as proxies for change, TRIM aims to examine which trait-combinations impart vulnerability to stress in corals and fishes independently and in coral-fish relationships that underpin reef function. Recognising the crucial role that coral-fish relationships play in shaping reef ecosystems, TRIM will discover which traits and functional types linking the two taxa drive their combined vulnerability.  By evaluating the responses of coral and fish communities and their functional types under stress, this project will link this knowledge to potential management objectives and identify actions specific to functional types, where vulnerable organisms are stringently protected and others can still be used.  I am trained as a marine conservation scientist with focus on spatial planning.  With this fellowship, I aim to expand my knowledge and scientific standing in functional ecology, which I believe is a crucial field to inform new ways of natural resource and biodiversity management.",False
"Title: seQureNet - Secure information processing in quantum networks Abstract: The promise of future quantum computers to substantially speed up computations has been advertised widely since the early days of the field. But there is a novel and fundamental aspect of devices based on quantum-mechanical principles that has just started to be explored: Quantum computers can preserve the privacy of computations. This aspect is a distinct new advantage of quantum computers over their classical counterparts. An entire class of unprecedented computations becomes feasible, in which the user data and the whole computation remain perfectly private – a feature impossible to achieve with classical computers. The main focus of this project is to exploit this feature and to implement secure photonic quantum information processing in distributed quantum networks. These networks consist of clients and small-scale quantum computers connected by communication channels. Photons are chosen as they are the ideal carriers for sending information over long distances. The clients can securely delegate computations to the quantum computers, such that neither the data nor the computation is revealed to the computers or any potential eavesdropper.

"Title: ACTING-NOW - Algorithmic Containment of Threats in Graphs, Networks or Webs Abstract: The project is about the security of networks, and how to select the best containing actions to perform when a network is threatened. Network security is a major concern for Europe in the guise of at least three threats: attacks on computer networks and related infrastructure; diseases spreading in networks consisting of people, livestock, crops or wildlife; and the spread of fires in forests or buildings. The project brings together an experienced researcher with a successful track record in “the firefighter problem” (which models the general network security problem), a supervisor with complementary expertise and world-leading research record in multi-objective optimization, a host organization with expertise and leading research groups in (i) Security, (ii) Randomized, heuristic optimization (from theory to industrial exploitation) and (iii) Human-Computer Interaction. Two non-academic secondment partners strengthen this team still further, bringing in industry-scale optimization experience (Noesis Solutions), and a long track record of advising for fire safety to major infrastructure projects including to the military (Lee Anderson). The experienced researcher will use the training and mobility afforded by this complementary partnership to further the impact of his research on European security, benefit from skills training in industrial exploitation and on offering policy advice, and learn a range of additional academic and non-academic skills from participating in the training of young researchers. Scientific results of the project include new, effective computational methods achieving better results in practical applications mentioned above. Theoretical understanding of spreading emergencies in graphs will be useful in fundamental research in other fields, for example, in medicine in research aimed at utilizing the knowledge about contacts in the population for understanding how disease traits (such as the transmission rate and the infectious period) evolve.",True
"Title: GreenML5G - Green Machine Learning for 5G and Beyond Resource Optimisation Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionising a wide range of industries. Wireless networks with emerging high dimensional challenges are set to benefit from data-driven deep learning optimisation across layers. In particular, we expect that the deep supervised and deep reinforcement learning modules can resolve high-dimensionality inputs, achieve near optimal solutions, and efficiently scale via confederated learning. However, what is not well understood is the energy cost and carbon footprint of AI in future wireless networks. The danger is that intelligent networks are not green networks and that the recent progress made in green communication risk being undermined by the new breed of AI-based wireless communication. Here, in this project, we propose to develop green machine learning algorithms for radio resource management. This will lead to a future of intelligent and sustainable wireless networking.",True
"Title: SuperEMFL - Superconducting magnets for the European  Magnet Field Laboratory Abstract: The magnetic field is a powerful thermodynamic parameter to influence the state of any material system and such is an outstanding experimental tool for physics. To go beyond the conventional commercially available superconducting (SC) magnets, very large infrastructures such as the ones gathered within the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMLFL) are necessary. EMFL provides access to static resistive magnets (up to 38 T) and pulsed non-destructive (up to 100 T) and semi-destructive (up to 200 T) magnets for all qualified European researchers. 
Some recent advances open the way for the implementation of high temperature superconductor (HTS) magnets at the EMFL facilities. The SuperEMFL design study aims to add through the development of the HTS technology an entirely new dimension to the EMFL that go beyond the commercial offer, providing the European high field user community with much higher SC fields and novel SC magnet geometries, like large-bore-high-flux magnets or radial access magnets.
The development of SC magnets that can partly replace current high-field resistive magnets will result in a significant reduction of the energy consumption of the static field EMFL facilities. This will strongly improve EMFL’s financial and ecological sustainability and at the same time boost its scientific performance and impact.
 The high field values, the very low noise and vibration levels, and the possibility to run very long duration experiments will make high SC magnetic fields attractive to scientific communities that so far have rarely used the EMFL facilities (NMR, scanning probe, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, ultra-low temperature physics,  electro-chemistry …). 
All these new research possibilities will strengthen the scientific performance, efficiency and attractiveness of the EMFL and thereby of the European Research Area (ERA). The implementation of this strategy should therefore be considered as a major upgrade of the EMFL.",False
"Title: AceLSAA - optimal design of Admixtures for concrete embedded Large Scale Antenna Array Abstract: Large scale antenna array (LSAA) has been introduced into 5G cellular networks to address the capacity crunch indoors. LSAAs will increase the physical dimension of the base station (BS), generating negative consequences on weight, wind load and visual impact. A potential solution of deploying LSAA indoors is to embed it into building structures, e.g., concrete walls. However, how the concrete impacts the wireless performance of concrete embedded antenna array (CEAA) has not been well studied. In this project, we will investigate how the electromagnetic (EM) properties of concrete will impact the wireless performance of CEAAs, and how to design and optimise the building properties of concrete to achieve both desirable mechanical and wireless performance. First, we will define metrics so that the wireless performance of CEAA can be measured. EM properties of concrete and the inhomogeneity of EM properties will be taken into account. Then, we will establish the relationship between the ratio and layout of admixtures and the EM properties of concrete. Three simplified concrete model, i.e., multilayer, lattice and 3D Poisson point process (PPP) models, will be proposed and verified through simulations and measurements. Finally, we will design concrete with desirable EM properties by changing the ratio and layout of admixtures under the constraint of mechanical performance to obtain an optimal wireless performance. After the completion of this project, we will be able tell how to optimize wireless performance of concrete under the constraint of its mechanical performance for typical building structures.",True
"Title: Beyond Boycott - Beyond Boycott: Musical Internationalism and the Making of Race in Apartheid South Africa Abstract: ""This project proposes to investigate the relationship between Western art music, cultural boycott, and the making of race in apartheid South Africa. In recent years people around the world have been encouraged to participate in political activism by the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, #RhodesMustFall, and numerous fossil fuel divestment campaigns. Artists and musicians, too, have contributed to these movements both as activists and through their work. But in a world where the arts are often celebrated for their capacity to promote peaceful dialogue, the confrontational nature of protest movements has prompted artists, scholars, and activists to ask, ‘How do cultural exchange and political activism intersect?’ ‘Beyond Boycott’ addresses this question from a historical perspective by turning to one of the most important precursors of current boycott movements: the global cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa (c.1954-1991). The proposed project develops a social and cultural history of the South African boycott, focusing especially on the hidden histories of Western art music performers—commonly described as ‘classical’ musicians—who defied sanctions to perform in the country. Through archival research, the project maps the extent of classical musicians’ breaking of the boycott, before asking how these performers interacted with the anti-apartheid movement, and how their appearances in South Africa contributed to a racial classification system that viewed culture as a marker of race. The main research objectives are to trace the extent of musical activity by international performers in defiance of the boycott, and to investigate the apartheid government's use of these performances to develop racial classifications and to advance political objectives. ‘Beyond Boycott’ fosters a new area of interdisciplinary research on the relationship between art music, race, and transnational politics.""",False
"Title: Strength2Food - Strengthening European Food Chain Sustainability by Quality and Procurement Policy Abstract: Strength2Food is a 5-year, €6.9 million project to improve the effectiveness of EU food quality schemes (FQS), public sector food procurement (PSFP) and to stimulate Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC) through research, innovation and demonstration activities. Our 30-partner consortium representing 11 EU and 4 non-EU countries combines leading academic, communication, SME and stakeholder organisations to ensure a multi-actor approach. It will undertake case study-based quantitative research to measure economic, environmental and social impacts of FQS, PSFP and SFSC. The impact of PSFP policies on balanced nutrition in schools will also be assessed. Primary research will be complemented by advanced econometric analysis of existing datasets to determine impacts of FQS and SFSC participation on farm performance and survival, as well as understand price transmission and trade patterns. Consumer knowledge, confidence in, valuation and use of FQS labels and products will be assessed via cross-national survey, ethnographic and virtual supermarket-based research. Lessons from the research will be applied and verified in 6 pilot initiatives, focusing on less-developed and transition regions. These initiatives bring together academic and non-academic stakeholder partners in action research. The six pilot actions are: a school meals initiative to improve the nutritional outcomes and economic benefits for local agri-food producers; in-store trials (undertaken with a grocery retailer) to upscale sales of local produce; a scheme to stimulate a sustainable SFSC that adds value to the fishing community; and pilot actions to expand regional food labelling; increase sales of FQS products in non-traditional markers; and improve returns to local producers at food fairs and farmers’ markets (via a smartphone app).

"Title: MORE - Multi-modal Optimisation for Road-space in Europe Abstract: The primary aim of MORE is to develop and implement procedures for the comprehensive co-design of urban main road corridor infrastructure feeding the European TEN-T network, to accommodate their current and future multi-modal and multi-functional requirements; and to address severe problems of congestion, sustainability, noise, air pollution, safety, security, etc., in situations where building new roads is not an option. And in such cases to enable city authorities to make the best use of available road-space, by optimally allocating the available capacity dynamically, in space and time; taking advantage of advances in big data and digital eco-systems, and in new vehicle technologies and operating systems, in materials and construction technologies, and in dynamic traffic signing and lane marking capabilities. 
This aim is achieved by comprehensively assessing the needs of all road user groups - and of those who live, work and visit the area – drawing on existing knowledge and extensive stakeholder engagement, to establish design criteria. Key performance indicators will be developed to define and measure the degree to which a road is operating satisfactorily, and to set out design requirements when performance is sub-standard. Four web or computer-based tools will be developed to assist in the road-space reallocation design process, covering: option generation, stakeholder engagement, micro-simulation of road user behaviour, and a comprehensive, multi-modal appraisal tool.   
The project will test these tools and procedures through the detailed development of street design packages at test sites (feeder route corridors) in five partner cities on different TEN-T networks, and on- and off-road trials will be carried out to test some of the components. Based on these various outputs, MORE will develop new guidelines for optimal urban road-space allocation and disseminate and exploit them and the design tools, widely throughout Europe.",False
"Title: TrustVehicle - Improved trustworthiness and weather-independence of conditional automated vehicles in mixed traffic scenarios Abstract: Automated driving can be implemented with relatively simple controllers if the current location of the ego vehicle and the current and future locations of other road users are known without uncertainty. However, this is not going to happen in the initial stages of the introduction of automated driving systems into the market. As a consequence, system and human driver uncertainty pose a significant challenge in the development of trustable and fault-tolerant automated driving controllers, especially for conditional automation (SAE level 3) in mixed traffic scenarios. The TrustVehicle consortium brings together participants from the whole vehicle value chain to enhance safety and user-friendliness of level 3 automated driving systems. The main objectives are: (i) the systematic identification of critical road scenarios based on in-depth analysis of possible traffic situations and human behaviour; (ii) the setup of new tools for the cost- and time-effective assessment of driver-in/off-the-loop situations; (iii) design of controllers and sensor fusion systems capable of dealing with complex, uncertain and variable road scenarios to enhance road safety; (iv) the implementation of intuitive human-machine interfaces for the safe management of the transition phases taking into account user acceptance and gender-specific aspects; and (iv) the establishment of an adaptive and agile vehicle validation based on self-diagnostics and data logging to steadily extend the list of relevant scenarios and test cases. The outputs of the TrustVehicle project will be extensively assessed in real-world operating conditions on four demonstrators representing four vehicle classes. End users of the technology will systematically and thoroughly express their requirements, expectations, and concerns during the consortium activity. Special focus will be put on the demonstration of the fault-tolerant and fail-operational system behaviour at any time and for different kinds of weather conditions.",True
"Title: TUNEMODE - TUNABLE MODE RANDOM FIBER LASER FOR MODE DIVISION MULTIPLEXING LASER SOURCE Abstract: The evolution of the bandwidth demand in optical fiber communication system in the Europe region keeps increasing year after year. As for now, most of these demands are supported by the WDM system of optical communication network. It is forecasted that this increasing bandwidth demand could not be supported any more data traffics in the future due to the consumption growth of new applications. In this regards, a new system for solving this issue is becoming all the necessary. An alternative which is forecasted to be able to fulfill this demand is Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM). MDM basically is based on a concept developed for increasing the optical data transmission capacity within the optical fiber itself. Thus, this project will be carried out to investigate the mode tuning of random fiber laser for the application in MDM system. The main objective of this project is to generate a laser with various modes which can be tuned by using few mode fiber and will be using random fiber laser. The purpose of using random fiber laser is because the conventional rare earth based fiber laser such as Erbium and Ytterbium are not optimized for lasing at higher order mode than the fundamental mode LP01. Investigation on mode tunability will be carried out using micro fiber technology and also fiber Bragg grating technology whereby the combination of these two technologies will be functioning as the tunable and filtering element. Also, in this project, new ideas and concepts will be developed whereby the generation of a laser with various modes will probably generate new concepts and findings, not only for MDM system, but also for the device to support this application in the future. In this regards, this research is very significant, in conjunction with the growth of the bandwidth demand in the Europe region as well as in the world.",True
"Title: TASAB - TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE ALGAL BIOREFINERY Abstract: Algal-based biofuels are increasingly attracting attention as they have the capacity to serve both as a source of renewable carbon fuels and as a powerful tool for carbon sequestration. However, algal biofuel production remains outside the realm of economic feasibility due to the energy-intensive extraction techniques and limitations in algal cultivation which requires large amounts of fertilizer. Existing commercial algal biomass production technologies are prohibitively expensive for fuel generation which represents a commercial constraint to developing competitive European algal biofuel companies. The proposed Fellowship – TASAB - is a novel algal biorefinery concept, offering an environmentally-sustainable closed system integrating both thermal and biochemical conversion pathways. This concept will be able to maximize energy production from algae for achieving a net positive energy balance and to almost fully recycle nutrients to support algal large scale production and reduce the economic and environmental impacts associated with synthetic fertilizer use. TASAB will enhance and upgrade bio-oil yield and produce value-added products and biochemicals which could be sold at a premium and would offset production costs for energy generation. TASAB will enable this sector to produce cost-competitive biofuels, while creating a future-oriented sustainable economy. TASAB is a multidisciplinary project, enabling the Fellow to expand his research capabilities by undergoing intensive training in thermal processing at the EBRI (Birmingham, UK), algal biomass culturing techniques at the EBRI and Varicon Aqua Ltd (UK), anaerobic fermentation and electrolysis at LBE (France) and nutrient recovery at SOTON (UK).

"Title: OTR - Off The Rails Abstract: Off the Rails is a concept to develop a mobile application that intelligently understands user movement patterns, not just in terms of location, speed and transport mode. Utilising smart-phone sensors, GPS mapping and game mechanics, it will give the user the vectored detail of their daily travels.  
The unique concept is being developed in the context of Mudlark’s world-leading digital public transport game, Chromaroma, which turns all swipes of a player’s London travel smartcard into gameplays and achievements, promoting sustainable transport use by encouraging non-rush hour travel.
The advent and increasing accuracy of geolocation data harnessed with the prevalence of powerful personal mobile devices means we use OTR to make the individual traveller a transport integrator.  We can build a platform that attracts these solo integrators and retains them by improving their travel experience, at the same time capturing individual journey data. That platform can then flip the transport integration problem by addressing it from the user level up.
By combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into an innovative, disruptive and competitive solution, we will enhance the profitability and growth performance of Mudlark (an SME). We need the funding from this grant to help seize the European and global business opportunity. 
As well furthering our understanding the commercial case, our project objectives are to:
● Discover and understand the user needs. This will culminate in a framework and design scoping document.
● Test initial technical and tracking assumptions with an end-user group.
● Design the user experience and game using screen and paper prototypes. 
● Produce a detailed report, game design document and business planning roadmap.

"Title: SmartResilience - Smart Resilience Indicators for Smart Critical Infrastructures Abstract: ""Modern critical infrastructures are becoming increasingly “smarter” (e.g. cities). Making the infrastructures “smarter” usually means making them smarter in normal operation and use: more adaptive, more intelligent… But will these smart critical infrastructures (SCIs) behave equally “smartly” and be “smartly resilient” also when exposed to extreme threats, such as extreme weather disasters or terrorist attacks? If making existing infrastructure “smarter” is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover?
These are the main questions tackled by this proposal.
The proposal envisages answering the above questions in several steps. (#1) By identifying existing indicators suitable for assessing resilience of SCIs. (#2) By identifying new “smart” resilience indicators (RIs) – including those from Big Data. (#3) By developing a new advanced resilience assessment methodology (TRL4) based on smart RIs (“resilience indicators cube”, including the resilience matrix). (#4) By developing the interactive “SCI Dashboard” tool. (#5) By applying the methodology/tools in 8 case studies, integrated under one virtual, smart-city-like, European case study. The SCIs considered (in 8 European countries!) deal with energy, transportation, health, water…
Results #2, #3, #4 and #5 are a breakthrough innovation.
This approach will allow benchmarking the best-practice solutions and identifying the early warnings, improving resilience of SCIs against new threats and cascading and ripple effects.

Yet a generation later, almost every facet of our individual, public and -now- online life are dominated by the fast-pacing digital transformation. Last year we saw the privacy and data of millions of social media users compromised with little to no accountability for those responsible, national elections influenced by users in different states, news outlets struggling to convince readers of facts, and the European Union taking proactive measure to protect the data privacy of its citizens in its first transnational regulatory action. Yet, the digital literacies and capabilities necessary for citizens to thrive in a digital society and act as responsible and effective participants, are unequally distributed across the European cultural, economic and social strata, with the public sphere consequently rapidly dissolving. ARTSFORMATION will respond through research, innovation and applied artistic practice to these societal challenges, by equitably developing the capacity of artists and citizens alike -including those from geographically remote, socio-economically excluded minority, refugee and migrant backgrounds- to respond cohesively in making their communities and groups resilient and adaptive in the 4th Industrial Revolution.",True

In addition to the challenge of time, the new technologies are subjected to other pressing factors such as qualification, regulation, cost, biocompatibility and the need to be applicable worldwide. In the most recent years it is obvious that nano-enabled MTs can be applied in nearly every medical area, with a major presence and increased importance in cancer, regenerative medicine, advanced therapies, neurology, cardiology, orthopaedics, and dentistry. On the other hand, any innovation in the Health sector has to be carefully assessed in terms of risk/benefit ratio. Nano-enabled MTs particularly require careful assessment, since they are complex products group and their technological assessments are still under development.

"Title: ECoWeB - Assessing and Enhancing Emotional Competence for Well-Being (ECoWeB) in the Young: A principled, evidence-based, mobile-health approach to prevent mental disorders and promote mental well-being Abstract: Although there are effective mental well-being promotion and mental disorder prevention interventions for young people, there is a need for more robust evidence on resilience factors, for more effective interventions, and for approaches that can be scalable and accessible at a population level. To tackle these challenges and move beyond the state-of-the-art, ECoWeB uniquely integrates three multidisciplinary approaches: 
(a) For the first time to our knowledge, we will systematically use an established theoretical model of normal emotional functioning (Emotional Competence Process) to guide the identification and targeting of mechanisms robustly implicated in well-being and psychopathology in young people; 
(b) A personalized medicine approach: systematic assessment of personal Emotional Competence (EC) profiles is used to select targeted interventions to promote well-being: 
(c) Mobile application delivery to target scalability, accessibility and acceptability in young people. 
Our aim is to improve mental health promotion by developing, evaluating, and disseminating a comprehensive mobile app to assess deficits in three major components of EC (production, regulation, knowledge) and to selectively augment pertinent EC abilities in adolescents and young adults. It is hypothesized that the targeted interventions, based on state-of-the-art assessment, will efficiently increase resilience toward adversity, promote mental well-being, and act as primary prevention for mental disorders. The EC intervention will be tested in cohort multiple randomized trials with young people from many European countries against a usual care control and an established, non-personalized socio-emotional learning digital intervention. Building directly from a fundamental understanding of emotion in combination with a personalized approach and leading edge digital technology is a novel and innovative approach, with potential to deliver a breakthrough in effective prevention of mental disorder.",True

Neurological diseases such as epilepsy is a life-threatening progressive disorder causing uncontrolled activity of the brain (seizure). The ability to decipher brain functions and understand the neuronal communication networking properties to develop innovative solutions to treat neurological diseases remains one of the biggest challenges to date. A recent approach to study the brain is optogenetics. Optogenetics is a neural modulation technique which utilizes light to stimulate genetically engineered neurons, providing a better option for controlling the cells compared to conventional electrical stimulation.  Scientists pursuing optogenetic therapies still face some technical challenges (e.g. size and multifunctional capability, biointegration, wireless capability, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatibility) that keeping optogenetics from clinical trials for brain diseases. I will combine the innovative wireless power transfer (WPT) approaches with ultrathin, soft and flexible biocompatible polymeric platforms to fabricate and characterize neural implants that are small enough to promote scalability, chronic reliability, and MRI compatibility. By associating the ability to wirelessly monitor (e.g. neural activities) and control (stimulation or inhibition) through these neural implants using a smartphone establishes a novel approach for versatile optogenetics to treat epilepsy.

"Title: THIODIV - Exploring thioalkynes potential in gold catalysis with a divergent reactivity manifold Abstract: THIODIV brings together the complementary expertise of Dr Nagnath More (NM, expertise in oxidative reactions and arylation processes) with Dr Paul Davies (Host, expertise in gold catalysis and sulfur-based reaction development). 
Gold catalysis attract significant international interest due to its ability to generate metal carbene character from alkynes delivering more sustainable synthesis. Current strategies to address the major challenge of site-selective carbene formation use terminal alkynes, or those with strongly electron-donating- or electron-withdrawing groups. Limitations derive from the gold carbenes environment and its impact on reactivity, or the incorporation of undesired directing groups. THIODIV will study the potential of sulfur-substitution to deliver complementary directing effects while introducing a desirable functional group into the resulting molecule.  Preliminary studies show that sulfur can enable gold-catalysed reactivity, yet propose different directing-modes which lead to different regiocontrol. The overall aim of THIODIV is to examine the role of sulfur substitution on alkynes in gold catalysis and clarify its influence on reactivity, and hence allow wider application of sulfur-directing groups in gold catalysis and synthesis more widely. 
A diversity-generating dynamic reaction manifold will be used to elucidate key control parameters by studying two approaches, an oxidative rearrangement, and an arylative rearrangement. Alongside insight into reaction control and directing effects, THIODIV will provide new and efficient access to motifs that are featured in numerous bioactive compounds and are highly desirable in industry and academia as synthetic intermediates. While addressing fundamental questions of reactivity and control, THIODIV will also equip NM with the skills to incorporate hit- and lead-like properties into structure-reactivity studies to deliver new molecular entities that are applicable in pharmaceutical discovery.",False

The strict power limitations means that these demands cannot be met through hardware improvements alone, however, but the software must better exploit the available resources.  Unfortunately, programmers are hindered when creating low-power GPU software by the quality of current performance analysis tools.  In low-power GPU contexts there is only a minimal amount of performance information, and essentially no power information, available to the programmer.  As software becomes more complex it becomes increasingly unmanageable for programmers to optimise the software for low-power devices.

This project proposes to aid the programmer in creating software for low-power GPUs by building on the results of the first LPGPU project to provide a complete performance analysis process for the programmer.  This project will address all aspects of performance analysis, from hardware power and performance counters, to a toolchain that processes and visualises information from these counters, to applications that will be used as use-cases to drive the entire design.  To access the new hardware performance counters a standardisable API will be produced to interface to a prototype hardware implementation.  This will let the analysis and visualisation tool connect to any GPU driver that implements the API.  The consortium's expertise will be used not only to drive the initial design of the API and analyses, but also multiple application use-cases will be developed to demonstrate the efficacy of the toolchain.",True
"Title: FlexLogIC - Development of a modular, integrated and autonomous ‘Factory-in-a-box’ production line for manufacturing high volumes of Flexible integrated LogIC circuits Abstract: Our Flexible Integrated Circuits (FlexICs) are recognised by the likes of ARM as a disruptive innovation that will change the formation of the semiconductor industry significantly. We are PragmatIC Printing Ltd, pioneers of design, development and manufacture of non-silicon ICs on plastic. Our FlexICs are; thinner than a human hair; ultra-flexible and offered in flattering form factors and footprints that conventional silicon cannot offer. Our processes allow FlexICs to be produced on a large scale at a low cost; the marginal cost per IC in volume production can be <€0.1c. Non-silicon ICs bring many new potential market applications previously unattainable with conventional technology. FlexICs that are visually unobtrusive are ideal for integration onto goods packaging, controlled documents, and others. During Phase 1, we validated the market potential for our FlexICs. A conservative estimate shows a demand for 800bn FlexICs p/a, which is a fraction of the full 40trillion p/a potential.

In order to facilitate this demand, we want to enable localised FlexIC production capacity for packagers, integrators and component manufacturers for immediate integration into end-products. Our solution is to develop a ‘factory-in-a-box’; a self-contained, modular and autonomous production facility containing all of our novel processes. This FlexLogIC plant will deliver the FlexICs required cost effectively at market accepted price levels. We have strong documented need and demand pull from market leading companies such as Crown Packaging, Cartamundi, Molex and SMARTRAC and others for an integrated solution such as FlexLogIC.

Within 2 years, we will develop an entry-level module (ELMo) with capacity to produce upto 800m FlexICs p/a. The 5-year forecasts conservatively show a net cash inflow of €63.1m (mostly from license fees) by 2022 with an ROI of 47%. We are currently the only Company with the capability to supply an autonomous facility for high-volume manufacture of FlexICs.",False
"Title: GREENSENSE - Sustainable, Wireless, Autonomous Nanocellulose-based Quantitative DoA Biosensing Platform Abstract: Paper-based printed electronics are new recyclable electronic devices with technical, economic and environmental advantages. Additionally, nanocellulose (NC) based printed electronics, produced mainly from wood pulp, offer better printability and performance than paper. Therefore, the integration of NC-based printed electronics and biosensors is a promising source of innovation in the biomedical industry. In GREENSENSE we propose the development of a sustainable NC-based biosensing platform for Drug-of-Abuse (DoA) analysis, that integrates high-added value printed electronic components (a new biosensor, an NFC communication system, an energy storage system and a display) with a silicon microchip to provide it with multi sensor data processing, autonomy and wireless communication and that is easy for the user to read.  The main goal of the project will be the use of NC as: substrate for the printed electronics, lamination film for the encapsulation of the final device and as active component in the formulation of functional inks (conductive, electrochemical, electrolyte and dielectric). In all cases the NC surface will be functionalized to be printable, with good barrier properties and compatible with the functional inks (bioactive, conductive, dielectric, electrochemical, electrochromic and electrolyte). Pilot lines and high throughput, high precision and cost-effective S2S screen-printing and ink-jet printing techniques will be used to produce materials and components at large-scale. Two types of DoA biosensing platforms to eradicate the consume of drugs among the society will be developed: a strip-based platform (2nd generation) that will be connected to a Smartphone and a strip+reader-based platform (3rd generation) that will also include a display. The final flexible and recyclable NC-based biosensing platform will be mass producible with ultra-low power consumption and, therefore, cost-effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly.",True
"Title: INTERSTELLAR - Building the next generation high-speed data converters to strengthen European excellence and competitiveness on space applications and beyond Abstract: The proposed INTERSTELLAR project addresses one critical topic of European non-dependence under the line “High speed DAC-ADC based on European Technology” – analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue data converters. E2V designs, manufactures, supplies to the space market these essential components, but faces keen competition from US providers. To preserve know-how and production of such competitive components in Europe and to underscore its efforts for non-dependence, the industrial consortium proposes to develop two new data converters and to mature them to TRL6. A four-channel ADC, sampling at up to 6 GSPs offers ultra-wide input bandwidth, flexibility and high-speed serial outputs. A multi-channel DAC, reconstructing at up to 6 GSPs offers multi-Nyquist output bandwidth, configurable modes and high-speed serial inputs. Using a European semiconductor technology, the new converters shall target performances beyond today’s state-of-the-art to ensure their competitiveness by their delivery dates. Such devices facilitate innovative Rx-to-Tx signal chain solutions for satellite telecommunications, earth observation, navigation and scientific missions. To achieve the challenging objectives set, the four partners have intimate knowledge in space technology and will bring expertise to the project. E2V (F), coordinator, will be in charge of design, manufacturing and test activities. AIRBUS Defence & Space (UK) and THALES ALENIA SPACE (F), the two major European space companies, will make a key contribution as end-users of space data converters – guiding initial requirements and evaluating the devices under relevant conditions. The Fraunhofer Institute (D) will significantly contribute with reference PCBs hosting the new ADC and DAC, thus enabling detailed device evaluation and enhancing the dissemination of the results. Assembling such honed skills within a fruitful cooperation, promises to make the INTERSTELLAR project a great success for the European space industry.",True
"Title: BANYAN - Big dAta aNalYtics for radio Access Networks Abstract: As mobile services consumed by people and machines become increasingly diversified and heterogeneous, 4G/5G
networks are asked to meet a growing variety of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Network slicing, enabled by Network
Function Virtualization (NFV), is a promising paradigm to increase the agility and elasticity of the mobile network via logical
slices that can be formed and composed dynamically, so as to adapt to the fluctuations in the demands for different mobile
services.

A key enabler for network slicing is accurate data-driven models and the prediction of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the
mobile service traffic, which allow discovering knowledge relevant to the orchestration of slices and anticipating the need for
their reconfiguration. The need for effective data-driven slice management is especially critical in proximity of indoor Radio
Access Network (RAN), which must accommodate most of the volume and variations in the demand associated to each
mobile service and whose performance is crucial to user QoS.

The BANYAN project is designed to address major open issues towards the realisation of data-driven 5G RAN, as follows:
- Modelling and forecasting macroscopic high-dimensional mobile traffic patterns observed at RAN for individual services, at
multiple scales in time and space; 
- Geo-locating and characterising in-building mobile traffic patterns observed at RAN;
- Designing data-driven strategies for the allocation of 5G RAN resources; 
- Designing data-driven policies for the orchestration of 5G RAN resources to suit service requirements and dynamics via network slices;
- Coordinating outdoor and indoor heterogeneous networks to meet user QoS requirements.

To address the research objectives above, BANYAN pursues a tight academic-industrial cooperation, which will allow
developing key tools for data-driven 5G RAN, as well as properly training early-stage researchers who are urgently needed

"Title: LeaRNN - Principles of Learning in a Recurrent Neural Network Abstract: Forming memories, generating predictions based on memories, and updating memories when predictions no longer match actual experience are fundamental brain functions. Dopaminergic neurons provide a so-called “teaching signal” that drives the formation and updates of associative memories across the animal kingdom. Many theoretical models propose how neural circuits could compute the teaching signals, but the actual implementation of this computation in real nervous systems is unknown. 
This project will discover the basic principles by which neural circuits compute the teaching signals that drive memory formation and updates using a tractable insect model system, the Drosophila larva. We will generate, for the first time in any animal, the following essential datasets for a distributed, multilayered, recurrent learning circuit, the mushroom body-related circuitry in the larval brain. First,  building on our preliminary work that provides the synaptic-resolution connectome of the circuit, including all feedforward and feedback pathways upstream of all dopaminergic neurons, we will generate a map of functional monosynaptic connections. Second, we will obtain cellular-resolution whole-nervous system activity maps in intact living animals, as they form, extinguish, or consolidate memories to discover the features represented in each layer of the circuit (e.g. predictions, actual reinforcement, and prediction errors), the learning algorithms, and the candidate circuit motifs that implement them. Finally, we will develop a model of the circuit constrained by these datasets and test the predictions about the necessity and sufficiency of uniquely identified circuit elements for implementing learning algorithms by selectively manipulating their activity.
Understanding the basic functional principles of an entire multilayered recurrent learning circuit in an animal has the potential to revolutionize, not only neuroscience and medicine, but also machine-learning and robotics.",False
"Title: i-PROGNOSIS - Intelligent Parkinson eaRly detectiOn Guiding NOvel Supportive InterventionS Abstract: Transition from healthy status to Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is vaguely tractable, since symptoms can be so subtle in the early stages that they go unnoticed. Lack of biomarkers and/or findings on routine MRI and CT scans, PD is left undiagnosed for years, gradually affecting the life of over 6.5 million of older adults (>55-60 yrs) worldwide, increasing the risk of their health deterioration. Epidemiological studies conclude that early intervention could have an inverse relation with the PD-related risks of progressive frailty, falls and emotional shift towards depression. Based on this evidence, the cardinal objective of i-PROGNOSIS is the development of (i) an ICT-based behavioural analysis approach for capturing, as early as possible, the PD symptoms appearance, and (ii) the application of ICT-based interventions countering identified risks. To achieve this, awareness initiatives will be employed, so as to construct i-PROGNOSIS community, targeting > 5000 older individuals within the duration of the project, in order to unobtrusively sense large scale behavioural data from its members, acquired from their natural use of mobile devices (smartphone/smartwatch). Ensuring anonymisation and secure Cloud archiving, i-PROGNOSIS will develop and employ advanced big data analytics and machine learning techniques, in a distributed and privacy aware fashion, so as to instantiate a PD Behavioural Model and construct reliable early PD symptoms detection alarms. To those identified and clinically validated as early stage PD patients, ICT-based interventions will be provided via the i-PROGNOSIS Intervention Platform, including: a) a Personalised Game Suite (ExerGames, DietaryGames, EmoGames, Handwriting/VoiceGames) for physical/emotional support, b) targeted nocturnal intervention to increase relaxation/sleep quality and c) assistive interventions for voice enhancement and gait rhythm guidance.

"Title: DIPLOFACE - Diplomatic Face-Work - between confidential negotiations and public display Abstract: The rise of social media, coupled with intensifying demands for more transparency and democracy in world politics, brings new challenges to international diplomacy. State leaders and diplomats continue to react to traditional media, but now also attempt to present themselves proactively through tweets, public diplomacy and nation branding. These efforts often take place simultaneously and sometimes interfere directly with closed-door negotiations and its culture of restraint and secrecy. Yet the relationship between confidential diplomacy and public representation remains understudied.

DIPLOFACE will develop a sociologically and anthropologically informed approach to studying how state leaders and diplomats manage their nation’s ‘faces’ in the information age. The project will explore the relationship and tensions between confidential diplomatic negotiations and publicly displayed interventions in various media, applying the micro-sociological concept of ‘face-work’. DIPLOFACE will analyse the complex interactional dynamics that shape the diplomatic techniques and strategies used to convey a nation’s ‘face’ or ‘image of self’. Such face-work is increasingly important for national leaders and diplomats who perform simultaneously on the ‘back-stage’ and the ‘front-stage’ of international relations. DIPLOFACE will identify, theorize and analyse the repertoire of face-saving, face-honouring and face-threatening practices that are employed in confidential negotiations and in public. 
 
DIPLOFACE advances our theoretical understanding of diplomacy in the 21st century significantly beyond existing International Relations and diplomatic theory. Combining participant observation, interviews and media analysis, DIPLOFACE will generate important new knowledge about the relationship between public and confidential multilateral negotiation, how state leaders and diplomats handle new media, and the role of face-saving and face-threatening strategies in international relations.",True
"Title: MUSIQ - Multiphoton Microscopy and Ultrafast Spectroscopy: Imaging meets Quantum Abstract: In the quest to decipher the chain of life from molecules to cells, the biophysical questions being asked increasingly demand techniques that are capable of identifying specific biomolecules in their native environment at the smallest possible scale, and measuring their interactions quantitatively without perturbing the system under observation. Laser-based optical microscopy is a key technology to drive this progress in the 21st century. Still, many challenges remain in particular toward i) achieving imaging with biomolecular specificity without the artefacts from sample staining, ii) quantitative imaging, and iii) single molecule sensitivity. Progress toward biomolecular specificity at very high temporal resolution has been brought by the development of ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, able to address the importance of quantum coherences with the potential to unravel the fundamental machinery of Nature. Yet, measuring quantum phenomena with an optical microscope is technically challenging, and far from real-world biological applications. MUSIQ is designed as an innovative research and training network, where we will recruit 15 Early Stage Researchers to work toward the central ambitious goal of developing the next-generation optical microscopy exploiting quantum coherent nonlinear phenomena. The network brings together a unique team of 7 world-leading academics and 6 high tech companies at the forefront of optical microscopy and ultrafast laser technology developments merged with fundamental understanding of coherent light-matter interaction phenomena, development of quantitative image analysis tools, and biomedical/pharmaceutical real-world applications.

"Title: COSMOS - DevOps for Complex Cyber-physical Systems Abstract: Much of the increasing complexity of ICT systems is being driven by the more distributed and heterogeneous nature of these systems, with Cyber Physical Systems accounting for an increasing portion of Software Ecosystems. This basic premise underpins the COSMOS proposal which focuses on blending best practices DevOps solutions with the development processes used in the CPS context: this will enable the CPS world to deliver software more rapidly and result in more secure and trustworthy systems.

COSMOS brings together a balanced consortium of big industry, SMEs and academics which will develop enhanced DevOps pipelines which target development of CPS software. These pipelines will integrate more sophisticated validation and verification (V&V) which will comprise of a mix of static code analysis correlated with issues and bug reports, automated test case generation, runtime verification, Hardware in the Loop (HiL) testing and feedback from field devices. Approaches based on Machine Learning, model based testing and search based test generation will be employed. Techniques to prioritize and schedule testing to maximize efficacy of the testing process and to minimize security threats will also be developed. COSMOS will leverage existing prototype technologies developed by the partners supporting enhancing them throughout the project.

The COSMOS CPS pipelines will be validated against 5 use cases provided by industrial partners representing healthcare, avionics, automotive, utility and railway sectors. These will act as reference use cases when promoting the technology amongst Open Source and standardization communities. For the former a specific community building activity will be performed to stimulate engagement with Open Source; for the latter, the standards experience of the coordinator and partners will be employed to promote COSMOS technologies within heavily regulated sectors where there is an increasing need for well-defined software V&V solutions.",False
"Title: SPA4AstroQIT - Broadband Quantum-Limited Parametric Amplifier for Astronomy and Quantum Information Technology Abstract: The emerging technology of superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) can achieve quantum-limited sensitivity over broad bandwidth, by utilising the wave-mixing mechanism in a passive nonlinear transmission medium. They are compact, easy to fabricate with planar circuit technology, have ultra-low heat dissipation, and can be integrated directly with other detector circuits. Their performances are far superior to the state-of-the-art high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier, and they can operate from radio to THz frequencies. Therefore, they could potentially revolutionise almost every kind of microwave, millimetre (mm) and sub-millimetre (sub-mm) instrumentation: from observational astronomy to quantum information experiments. Their deployment as readout amplifiers could improve the heterodyne receiver sensitivity significantly, and enable the construction of large bolometric arrays. Their large bandwidth, high power handling and quantum-noise performance could have profound effect on quantum computing architecture, improve the fidelity to process hundreds of quantum bits (qubit). They can be used as front-end high frequency amplifiers operating at THz frequencies, which is hard to achieve with HEMT technology. In this proposal, I aim to develop: 1) ultra-broadband readout amplifiers for mm/sub-mm astronomical receivers and qubit experiments, which would enable the construction of large pixel-count system; 2) front-end amplifiers at mm frequencies for heterodyne receivers and B-mode Cosmic Microwave Background experiments; and 3) parametric frequency down-converter with positive conversion gain to replace Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) as ultra-low noise heterodyne mixer for large array application. The successful development of these programmes not only could transform the mm/sub-mm instrumentation in the future, but could also have huge impact on many other fields such as telecommunications, medical and quantum computing technology.",True
"Title: DC Metabolism - Metabolic Regulation of Conventional Dendritic Cell Development and Function Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in directing innate and adaptive immune responses against infections and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that control DC development and function may reveal new ways to alter the course of complex human diseases such as cancer. Despite their importance in immunity, some open questions remain in regards to DC basic biology. Two of these questions, in particular, are the subject of this application: 1) DCs are a heterogenous population, which can be subdivided into conventional DC type 1 (cDC1) and 2 (cDC2) subsets. Although their development depends on distinct transcriptional programs, cDC1 and cDC2 descend from a common precursor under the influence of the same growth factor cytokine. What determines cDC1/2 differentiation? 2) Various loss-of-function studies demonstrate that cDC1 are key antigen-presenting cells for initiating CD8+ T cell responses to tumours and some viruses. This primarily relies on a process termed cross-presentation. How is cross-presentation regulated in cDC1? Recent studies indicate that profound changes in cellular metabolism are coupled to immune cell function and may fundamentally underpin cell-fate decisions. Based on previous observations and our own preliminary data, we hypothesise that glycolysis programs cDC1 development and activation, whereas fatty acid metabolism controls the ability of the same cells to cross-present antigens to CD8+ T cells. We propose to define the metabolic programs that drive DC formation and that underlie cDC1 and cDC2 identity and complement this approach with loss and gain-of-function experiments that will allow specific testing of our hypotheses. Globally, these studies will identify novel mechanisms of immune cell control with implications for antiviral and anticancer immunity.",False

The framework will consist of fatigue models based on fatigue master curves and shift as well as FE predictive models that can be used as virtual assessment tools for HCF performance of CFRP materials.

PATH aims at cross linking different competences to study and develop prototype of plasma sources and plasma antenna based on hybrid technologies based on Radiofrequency and Hollow cathode technologies.
A Gaseous Plasma Antenna (GPA) is a plasma discharge confined in a dielectric tube that uses partially or fully ionized gas to generate and receive electromagnetic waves; GPAs are virtually “transparent” above the plasma frequency and become “invisible” when turned off. Unlike ordinary metallic antennas, GPAs and Plasma Antenna Arrays can be reconfigured electrically (rather than mechanically) with respect to impedance, frequency, bandwidth and directivity on time scales the order of microseconds or milliseconds. It is also possible to stack arrays of GPAs designed to operate at different frequencies. A Plasma Antenna will be able to: (i) identifying the direction of incoming signal, (ii) tracking and locating the antenna beam on the mobile/target, (iii) beam-steering while minimizing interferences.
Actual technology is based mainly on: (i) DC discharge, (ii) AC discharge, (iii) RF discharge, (iv) Microwaves, (v) Hollow cathode. Improvement of plasma source performances require a strong effort in term of modelling and technology.

"Title: DynFish - How the dynamics of personality variation, food intake and social interactions determine anti-predator escape Abstract: Escape responses (reaction to a threatening stimulus) are widespread in the animal kingdom and are critical for survival in many species. In recent years, it has become apparent that individuals differ consistently from one another in their behaviour, often called ‘animal personality variation’. Boldness refers to the extent to which animals take risks, and is a major personality trait that has important ecological and evolutionary implications. While it is widely accepted that the trade-off between exposure to predation risk and the benefit gained from it (e.g., greater access to food) generates personality variation in boldness, how and why bolder individuals are more likely to be preyed upon remain to be investigated. Furthermore, personality variation is also common in social species. Despite the extensive research on collective vigilance, personality variation has rarely been considered in this context. 

In this project, I will study how the relationship between boldness and food intake shapes anti-predator escape responses, shedding light on how the mechanisms of the food-mortality trade-off generate personality variation in boldness. For this purpose, I will first conduct experimental work on individuals and groups of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Individuals and groups will be tested in a setup allowing me to precisely control the behaviour of a predator model and study how escape responses vary with individual boldness, food intake and social interactions. Second, I will couple this experimental work with computer simulations to 1) fully characterise the food-mortality trade-off, 2) elucidate the mechanisms underlying individual differences in boldness, and 3) give new insights into the evolution and maintenance of personality variation under predation risk in different ecological conditions.",False
"Title: CAPABLE - CAncer PAtients Better Life Experience Abstract: After the primary intervention, most of cancer patients are managed at home, facing long-term treatments or sequelae, making the disease  comparable to a chronic condition. Despite their benefit, strong therapeutic regimens often cause toxicity, severely impairing quality of life. This may decrease adherence to treatment, thus compromising therapeutic efficacy. Also due to age-related multimorbidity, patients and their caregivers develop emotional, educational and social needs. CAPABLE will develop a cancer patient coaching system with the objective of facing these needs/issues.
The time is right to fully exploit Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data potentialities for cancer care and bring them to patients’ home. CAPABLE will rely on predictive models based on both retrospective and prospective data (clinical data, data from unobtrusive environmental and wearable sensors, data from social media and questionnaires). Models will be integrated with existing clinical practice guidelines and made available to oncologists.
Thanks to the mobile coaching system for patients, CAPABLE will allow identifying unexpected needs, and providing patient-specific decision support. This feature, together with the chance of discovering unknown adverse effects of new treatments, makes CAPABLE more than a personalised tool for improving life quality, an advance for the whole research community. 
Our team includes complementary partners with experience in data- and knowledge-driven AI, data integration, telemedicine, decision support. In addition, the involved patients’ association gives a unique opportunity to access thousands of questionnaires on patients’ needs, which will inform the system design.

"Title: EUROlinkCAT - EUROlinkCAT: Establishing a linked European Cohort of Children with Congenital Anomalies Abstract: Over 130,000 children born in Europe every year will have a congenital anomaly (CA; birth defect). These CAs, which are often rare diseases, are a major cause of infant mortality, childhood morbidity and long-term disability. 
EUROCAT is an established European network of population-based registries for the epidemiologic surveillance of CAs. EUROlinkCAT will use the EUROCAT infrastructure to support 21 EUROCAT registries in 13 European countries to link their CA data to mortality, hospital discharge, prescription and educational databases. Each registry will send standard aggregate tables and analysis results to a Central Results Repository (CRR) thus respecting data security issues surrounding sensitive data. The CRR will contain standardised summary data and analyses on an estimated 200,000 children with a CA born from 1995 to 2014 up to age 10, enabling hypotheses on their health and education to be investigated at an EU level. This enhanced information will allow optimisation of personalised care and treatment decisions for children with rare CAs. 
Registries will be supported in using social media platforms to connect with families who live with CAs in their regions. A novel sustainable e-forum, “ConnectEpeople”, will link these families with local, national and international registries and information resources. ConnectEpeople will involve these families in setting research priorities and ensuring a meaningful dissemination of results.
Findings will provide evidence to inform national treatment guidelines, such as concerning screening programs, to optimise diagnosis, prevention and treatment for these children and reduce health inequalities in Europe.  An economic evaluation of the hospitalisation costs associated with CA will be provided 
The CRR and associated documentation, including linkage and standardisation procedures and “ConnectEpeople” forum will be available post-EUROlinkCAT thus facilitating future local and EU level analyses.",False
"Title: CO2OLHEAT - Supercritical CO2 power cycles demonstration in Operational environment Locally valorising industrial Waste Heat Abstract: CO2OLHEAT will demonstrate at TRL7 in the CEMEX cement manufacturing plant in Prachovice (CZ) the operation of a 2 MW Waste-Heat-to-power (WH2P) skid based on a 2MW-sCO2 cycle able to efficiently valorize local waste heat at a significant temperature of 400°C. Capitalizing consortium excellent knowledge coming from previous sCO2 turbomachinery design experience and EU funded projects on industrial waste heat valorisation (TASIO, i-THERM, sCO2-FLEX etc.) and stimulated by SPIRE roadmap and EU sCO2 R&D initiatives, CO2OLHEAT aims to valorize waste heat even at higher temperature if compared with the traditional steam/ORC solutions. The project will demonstrate the EU MW scale first-of-a-kind waste heat-sCO2 plant towards a cheaper/more flexible waste heat valorisation. The project will strengthen EU industrial leadership in both energy intensive industries (making them more competitive) and turbomachinery sectors, bridging the current gap on sCO2 turbomachinery that EU has with US and Japan-Korea.

"Title: SCOOP - Innovation in Investigative Journalism Abstract: The objective of SCOOP is to study the impact of innovative technologies and new funding mechanisms on the role and working practices on investigative journalism. Investigative journalism should play a key role in democracy, but developments in digital media and new technologies (drones, mobile cameras) and changing funding models (crowd sourcing) is transforming this.
Traditional media organisations struggle to adapt to new patterns, work more efficiently with fewer journalists, and identifying new financing models for the resource-intensive practice of investigative journalism.  Studies find that alternative practices and professionals have emerged becoming a marketing strategy for media outlets and a tool to gain market share and new customers in a digital world. But there is a research gap about how investigative journalism is in flux. SCOOP will address this gap with findings on alternative financing models, new and creative use of technology and social media, and new forms for collaborations in the UK.
SCOOP involves a comprehensive ethnographic analysis of how investigative journalists in the UK media are adjusting to the challenges and possibilities created by new technologies; findings from a country with long tradition in investigative journalism will inform journalists, academics, decision makers, and the wider public in countries currently lacking funding and traditions for investigative journalism. I will interview and observe journalists and media actors from four major UK media organizations.
SCOOP will enhance my career as a professional journalist and as an educator of journalists. Cardiff University and HiOA will benefit from my enhanced skills and by the establishment of a virtual centre of investigative journalism to implement the outcomes of SCOOP, this should expand journalism research and training. SCOOP will benefit the media industry and journalism studies in general at a time of profound changes in the profession.",False
"Title: StressEBOV - Ebola virus manipulation of the cellular stress responses Abstract: Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly pathogenic filovirus that causes severe haemorraghic fever and killed over 11,000 people during the recent epidemic in Western Africa. Although potential vaccines and drugs are being tested, no treatment has been approved. Therefore, understanding the cellular regulation of EBOV replication is fundamental to develop novel treatments. 
EBOV is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus for which research is limited to BSL4 laboratories. However, a recent reverse genetic system using tetracistronic transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) allows modelling of the entire EBOV life cycle under BSL2 conditions. 
The EBOV genome is transcribed and replicated by the viral polymerase complex but the regulation of these processes remains poorly characterised. EBOV RNAs can also trigger antiviral responses via cytoplasmic RNA-sensors RIG-I and PKR, the latter also promoting stress granule (SG) formation. While EBOV inhibits RNA-sensing, the impact of SGs on EBOV is unknown. 
Therefore, I will investigate the role of cellular stress responses on EBOV replication and their potential counteraction by the EBOV VP35 protein using the trVLP system. Firstly, I will analyse the impact of SGs on EBOV replication by overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 depletion of SG proteins. Using a panel of VP35 mutants, I will also investigate its potential to counteract SGs by automated flow cytometric image acquisition (Imagestream). Secondly, I will identify the EBOV polymerase complex interactome during infection using two distinct proteomic approaches: co-purification with a VP35-GFP fusion protein(GFP-trap) and VP35biotin-ligase proximity tagging (BioID2). Candidate VP35 cofactors will be validated by biochemical interaction, CRISPR-knockout and live cell microscopy to determine their role in EBOV replication. In summary, this project will increase the understanding of EBOV replication and identify new therapeutic targets.",False
"Title: EXCITE - Electron and X-ray microscopy Community for structural and chemical Imaging Techniques for Earth materials Abstract: Understanding earth materials is critical to creating a sustainable, carbon-neutral society due to their involvement in many vital processes. Earth materials control the feasibility of subsurface energy storage, geothermal energy extraction, and are a source of critical elements for future-proof battery technologies. However, perturbations to geological systems can also result in hazards, such as human-induced earthquakes. If we want to tackle the current, pressing scientific questions related to sustainable development for a circular economy, there is an urgent need to make multi-scale, multi-dimensional characterisations of earth materials available to a broad spectrum of earth-science disciplines. In addition to the society-relevant topics, the properties of earth materials determine how the Earth works on the most fundamental level.
To overcome this challenge, 15 European facilities for electron and X-ray microscopy join forces to establish EXCITE (Electron and X-ray microscopy community for structural and chemical imaging techniques for earth materials). The collective aim of the EXCITE starting community is to enable access to high-end microscopy facilities and to join the knowledge and experience from the different institutions. By doing so, EXCITE will develop community-driven technological imaging advancements that will strengthen and extend the current implementation of leading-edge microscopy for earth-materials research. In particular, the EXCITE strategy is to integrate joint research programmes with networking, training, and trans-national access activities, to enable both academia and industry to answer critical questions in earth-materials science and technology. As such, EXCITE builds a community of highly qualified earth scientists, develops correlative imaging technologies and provides access to world-class facilities to particularly new and non-expert users that are often hindered from engaging in problem-solving microscopy of earth-materials.",False

"Title: Chromatin3D - Chromatin Dynamics in Development and Disease Abstract: The cell nucleus is organized and compartmentalized into a highly ordered structure that contains DNA, RNA, chromosomal and histone proteins which make up a structure called chromatin. The dynamics associated with these various components are responsible for regulating physiological processes and the overall stability of the genome. The destabilization of such regulatory mechanisms that act on the chromatin structure are implicated in pathologies such as cancer. Higher order organization of chromatin results in chromosomes which occupy discrete territories within the cell nucleus. Most nuclear processes occur or at least being initiated onto the chromosomes which makes them the main organizing factors in the nucleus. Several proteins that are involved in the replication of DNA, gene transcription and the processing of RNA are found enriched in discrete focal structures. An emerging question is how these structures assemble and are maintained in the absence of membranes and moreover what are the kinetics of stable binding and/or rapid exchange of their components. The dynamic assembly and modification of chromatin during developmental processes as well as the deregulation of such chromatin dynamics during the onset of disease lacks mechanistic insights at present. To address these questions we have put forward a multidisciplinary approach which involves molecular, cellular and systems level approaches by assembling a group of scientists from academia and industry with cross disciplinary expertise and capabilities.",False

"Title: CAMELOT - C2 Advanced Multi-domain Environment and Live Observation Technologies Abstract: The creation of the Schengen area has been one of the major achievements of the EU. However, this agreement requires countries to cooperate tightly in order to keep a high level of security at their internal borders, as well as to share the responsibility of managing external borders. Such a variety of borders (land, sea and air) and current challenges requires a consistent approach to border surveillance, based on a plethora of heterogeneous assets. These can be manned or unmanned, ranging from sensors (optical, radar, IR) to unmanned platforms (UAV, UGV, USV or UUV), and need to be combined to offer an integrated situational picture of the area under surveillance and of their location. In order to effectively control their operation and manage the large amounts of data collected by them, new approaches for command and control need to be considered, allowing efficient interaction between the operator and the different assets in the field. CAMELOT proposes to develop and demonstrate different advanced command and control service modules for multiple platform domains, based on a SOA architecture that specifies internal and external interfaces, allowing the development of a modular and scalable command and control station, customisable to the user needs. This architecture can be based on results of previous studies and work or open architectures that may prove more suitable and the interfaces can take advantage of the standardisation work that has been done already. After the definition, CAMELOT partners will prototype service modules according to their expertise, background individual technologies and practitioner needs. These will be integrated progressively in specific testing along the project. This prototype development approach will culminate in 2 final demonstrations involving end users and relevant stakeholders, to achieve a maturity of TRL6 (for most individual technologies supporting the functionalities for border surveillance) and an IRL of 7 for CAMELOT.",True
"Title: HRadio - Hybrid Radio everywhere for everyone Abstract: HRADIO (Hybrid Radio everywhere for everyone) focuses on radio service innovations enabled by convergence. While radio, with its rich editorial content, remains a highly popular medium, listening figures are slowly declining, particularly among youngsters. With the rapid rise of smartphones, radio faces competition from many new services including music steaming platforms. Regular radio today often does not include attractive features as known from vertical platforms. And if present, they are mostly not well integrated with the actual radio programme. This is where HRADIO will deliver.
Driven by the industry need to create attractive new radio experiences, the project will leverage the full potential of hybrid technology for radio – enabling the integration of cost-effective broadcast distribution with new online features. Broadcasters will be enabled to personalise radio services (while respecting privacy), to provide intuitive functionalities like time-shifting and, eventually, to foster and to exploit user engagement. HRADIO will pave the way to bring these features not only to broadcasters’ native mobile applications, but also to portals, to connected radios and into the car. The core approach is to integrate validated solutions and to harmonise APIs which together will provide broadcasters with an abstracted service layer accessible across any device and distribution platform – ensuring sustainability and return of investment. Therefore, consumers will be able to access their personal radio services on different devices and platforms enabled by a seamless broadcast-internet integration for radio content distribution. All features will be tested in 3 phases of large-scale pilots involving broadcasters, app developers for mobile and automotive devices. 
Eventually, HRADIO will publish its developments as ready-to-use Android and HTML client implementations including an extensive set of well documented APIs fostering new service developments for the radio sector.",True
"Title: SOFTSLIDE - Industrialization and commercialization of mass production processes for the texturing during moulding of dynamic seals in order to increase industrial equipment energy efficiency and durability Abstract: Softslide project's main objective is to generate €60 M revenue, an EBIDTA of €19,9M and 350 new jobs with the commercialization of SoftSlide's technology estimated from a conservative sub-market share of 15% of the total elastomeric and plastic dynamic seals European market. SoftSlide technology will positively impact the seal industry by providing around €3315 M/year in energy savings for hydraulic and pneumatic end-users. 
Energy losses caused by friction within dynamic seals in rotating, moving and reciprocating devices (e.g. motors, valves, air compressors, accumulators...) represent up to 25% of total energy consumption. In addition, dynamic seals related friction, damages the seal surface overtime, thus reducing its lifetime. Although, it is of common knowledge that low-friction dynamic seals can be obtained by specifically designing and engraving micro-patterns on the seal contact area (area in contact with the moving mechanism), current seals' mass production processes do not incorporate this crucial step. To get a low-friction dynamic seal, the micro-pattern needs to be individually engraved, seal by seal at an independent later stage, once the seal has been produced. This greatly increases the cost and limits the productivity of low-friction dynamic seals being impossible for end-users to include these in their systems. SoftSlide project has created a mass production process that transfers micro-patterns during moulding stage to obtain low-friction, high performing dynamic seals. This process can be easily adopted by dynamic seals manufacturers seals with an insignificant cost increase.",False
"Title: ORACLE - ORigin determination and improved detectAbility of Celestial-to-Local phEnomena by the VLF technique Abstract: The lower ionosphere (70–90 km), a ionized region in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, can be understood as a membrane acting as a sensor to different kinds of phenomena originating at Earth (e.g., lightning) or in space (e.g., space weather). Unexpected strong changes in this region can influence dramatically the performance and reliability of navigation and communication. However, the impact of those phenomena in this region is difficult to quantify accurately. On one hand, this region is too high for balloons and on the other hand it is too low for satellites. In this project, Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio waves will be used because they propagate between the Earth surface and the ionosphere with low attenuation. The researcher will push forward novel scientific understanding of the properties of the lower ionosphere and magnetosphere. She will: (1) determine whether the day-to-day variability of the VLF signal during sunrise can be explained by the ozone variability at its upper boundary, (2) find the yet unknown generation mechanism of VLF banded emissions, and (3) improve the detectability of galactic gamma-ray bursts, known as the most energetic phenomena in the universe. The project is strongly multidisciplinary, involving perspectives and concepts from astrophysics, magnetospheric, ionospheric, atmospheric physics and big data handling. This will be developed by the researcher within the frame of interaction and cooperation with the host and secondments. The results of this proposal have the potential to convey new perspectives in ionospheric and magnetospheric studies and provide some answers to long standing issues within the field of space weather, which has become of central importance in many aspects of human life and industry.

"Title: IILSCFLP - The Influence of Ionic Liquid Solvation on the Chemistry of Frustrated Lewis Pairs Abstract: Hydrogen (H2) is an important reagent for the chemical industry as well as representing a promising carbon-free fuel source when made from renewable sources. H2 needs to be activated for these applications, generally using rare, expensive and often toxic transition metal catalysts. Metal-free H2 activation has recently been demonstrated using the concept of ‘frustrated Lewis pairs’ (FLPs) based on main group elements such as phosphorous and boron rather than transition metals. FLPs are somewhat limited in scope due to the highly reactive Lewis acids (LAs) and bases (LBs) required for H2 activation which can lead to side reactions with substrates and solvents. The use of less reactive FLPs is restricted by the H2 activation step. This project addresses this problem by using the unique solvating ability of ionic liquids (ILs) to control the reactivity of FLPs for H2 activation. Many FLPs form ions when they react with H2. To promote H2 activation, it is essential that the reverse reaction (ion recombination to form H2) is prevented. The high ion dissociation power of ILs should prevent the recombination of these ions, leading to more efficient H2 activation. The impact of ILs on H2 activation by FLPs will be investigated in the context of synthesis and fuel cell applications. Successful use of ILs for this purpose would substantially increase the scope of FLP catalysts, reducing the reliance on transition metals thereby decreasing the potential cost and environmental impact of H2 activation processes. This project would represent the first study on the effect of ILs on FLP reactivity and combines the collective expertise of Prof. Welton (ILs) and Dr Ashley (FLPs) at Imperial College (IC) with the applicant’s background in ILs, kinetics and intermolecular interactions, while providing the applicant with productive collaborative partners and advanced training in catalysis, electrochemistry, IL and FLP chemistry to propel him towards an independent research career.",False

ICT tools (relying on QR codes) will be developed as the driver of the proposed eco-innovative services to take full advantage of the potential and synergies of two major revolutions of our time: the circular economy and the Industry 4.0. The project will thus contribute to transform the E&E sector into circular and 4.0, raising new opportunities for end-users (such as their involvement in design or the access to a product as a service) and for social and solidarity economy (conducted by NGOs, like EMAUS, which employ people at risk of social exclusion to repair and prepare WEEE for re-use). The techno-economic, environmental and social viability of the new CEBMs will be validated through demonstrations dealing with four target products belonging to different EEE categories: large household appliances, IT equipment, telecommunications equipment, and consumer equipment. These EEE categories together account for 77% of WEEE collected in the EU.
The project will result in an estimated economic benefit of 57.03 M€ over the period 2022-2026, which taking into account the project budget (8.03 M€) yields a ROI ~ 7.1.

"Title: H2Haul - Hydrogen fuel cell trucks for heavy-duty, zero emission logistics Abstract: H2Haul will develop and demonstrate a total of 16 new heavy-duty (26–44t) hydrogen fuel cell trucks in real-world commercial operations. The project includes two major European truck manufacturers (IVECO and VDL), who will build on existing small-scale prototyping activities to develop new zero-emission trucks tailored to the needs of European customers, mainly in large supermarket fleets. The vehicles will be standardised as far as possible to help encourage the development of the European supply chain. New high-capacity hydrogen refuelling stations will be installed to provide reliable, low carbon hydrogen supplies to the trucks. Most of the stations will be publicly accessible and this project will thus support the uptake of a broader range of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles.
The vehicles and infrastructure will be thoroughly tested via an extended trial with the high-profile end users over several years. The comprehensive data monitoring and analysis tasks will ensure that the technical, economic, and environmental performance of the hardware is assessed, and that the business case for further deployment of heavy-duty fuel cell trucks is developed. The scope and ambition of this innovative project will create a range of valuable information that will be disseminated widely amongst truck operators, representatives of the retail sector, policy makers, and the broader hydrogen industry.

"Title: BactoDrug - The Bacteroides dual-pumping membrane-integral pyrophosphatase: a novel drug target Abstract: Membrane-integral pyrophosphatases (M-PPases) couple cleavage of pyrophosphatase to pumping of ions across a membrane to generate membrane potential and play an important role in resistance to stressors. The solved structures of an H+-pumping M-PPase from Vigna radiata and an Na+-pumping M-PPase from Thermotoga maritima show M-PPases form a channel through the membrane, and this channel is plugged by an ion gate formed by three charged residues. Despite these structures, there are still many outstanding questions regarding M-PPases, especially in relation to H+ and Na+ dual-pumping M-PPases.

Bacteroides species are a major cause of anaerobic infections, and though they are part of a healthy human gut flora, when these bacteria escape the gut, they can cause bacteremia and abscess formation. Bacteroides species are associated with high antibiotic resistance rates and have a 19% or greater mortality rate. However, they do possess a possible drug target: an H+/Na+-pumping M-PPase.

A major goal of this project is to solve the structure of the Bacteroides vulgatus H+/Na+-pumping M-PPase to guide mutational studies to determine how M-PPases select for ions and to explore how the ion gate is opened and closed during ion pumping. Since the ion gate is closed in all M-PPase structures to date, I will also use single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to determine the kinetics and conformational changes during ion gate movement. Finally, I will use molecular mechanics modeling to simulate ion gate function and design small-molecule drug candidates. Molecules that trap the ion gate in the open conformation will convert M-PPase into a pore in the membrane of Bacteroides species, leading to collapse of the membrane potential. 

This project will further my career goal of pursuing research in bacterial pathogenesis from various perspectives, utilizing X-ray crystallography and single molecule technologies.",False

"Title: FSI in hadron decays - Final state interactions in heavy flavour decays Abstract: The precision study of complex multibody decays of bottom and charm hadrons has unique sensitivity to new fundamental particles and interactions that could give rise to the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, or dark matter. New, vast datasets allow for these studies to be performed with unprecedented experimental precision. However, theoretical uncertainties limit the sensitivity of this approach.

"Title: SmartGraphene - Graphene based smart surfaces: from visible to microwave Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to develop adaptive camouflage systems using graphene-enabled smart surfaces. We propose a new class of active surfaces capable of real-time electrical-control of its appearance in a very broad spectrum ranging from visible to microwave covering 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The proposed method relies on controlling electromagnetic waves by tuning density of high-mobility charges on single or multilayers of atomically thin graphene electrodes. We will realize this goal by efficient gating of large-area graphene using ionic liquids which yields unprecedented ability to control intensity and phase of the reflected and transmitted electromagnetic waves from the surface. Based on underlying physical mechanisms and applications, the proposed research plan is structured in 3 main directions; (1) Active surfaces in microwave and THz, (2) Active thermal surfaces, and (3) Active surfaces in the visible. 

The core idea of the proposal is based on a mutually-gated capacitor structure consisting of ionic liquid electrolyte sandwiched between two large area graphene. The voltage applied between the electrodes polarizes the ionic liquid and accumulates high-density of charges. Combining large scale chemical synthesis of graphene, novel device architectures and ionic liquid electrolyte we will develop new tools to understand and control light-matter interaction in a very broad spectrum. Then we will use these tools to fabricate new camouflage and display technologies on flexible polymers and paper substrates which cannot be realized by conventional semiconducting materials. We will challenge specific applications, such as THz compressive imaging, reconfigurable thermal shields, and electronic paper display.

"Title: snickerdoodle - An affordable edge-computing device for high-performance and power-efficient robotics automation Abstract: Industrial automation is a global trend of today’s industrial landscapes, aiming at increasing quality, flexibility and safety in
manufacturing lines by using robotics and IoT technologies to control machinery and manufacturing processes. Setting up
manufacturing automation lines is currently a time-consuming and costly process, since it requires to build up complex
hardware-software platforms by assembling many different expensive components (e.g., processing units, wireless modules,
GPIO, FPGA, etc.). In addition, platform customization for specific use-cases implies some – or all – of these components to
be changed, in order to meet the desired requirements (e.g., performance, power, interface, etc.). Krtkl has developed
Snickerdoodle, the first full-stack development board for robotic systems that combines functionality, usability and
affordability in just one palm-sized device. Snickerdoodle is conceived for high-performance robotics applications, and it can
be quickly and easily configured and re-programmed via a companion smartphone application (iOS & Android).

"Title: BCPPlus - New directions in bicyclopentane research Abstract: The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly seeking new tactics for the structural modification of drug candidates to avoid metabolic susceptibility, or to improve pharmacokinetic properties. Analogues called 'bioisosteres', which mimic the dimensions and substituent directionality of problematic structural motifs, but which are not themselves subject to the same pharmacological issues, offer one solution. Often based on scaffolds not found in ‘typical’ drug candidates, bioisosteres can additionally occupy new areas of intellectual property space. Within this growing field, rigid polycycles such as bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) are receiving significant attention as arene bioisosteres, as they exhibit similar ring diameters and substituent positioning, and also improve many pharmacokinetic properties relative to the parent arene. Despite the attractive nature of these motifs and current interest, the lack of general routes to complex BCP ring systems means this template is not yet fully accessible to industry. The invention of mild methods for [1.1.1.0]tricyclopentane (TCP) ring opening and functionalization could revolutionize use of BCPs in the pharmaceutical sector. 
One method not explored to date is an atom transfer radical addition reaction (ATRA) strategy. Using aryl or alkyl halides, ATRA could deliver an abundance of previously inaccessible polysubstituted BCPs from generalized TCP, which would revolutionize this immature, cutting-edge area of organic and medicinal chemistry. 
This research proposal seeks to: i) explore general and mild ATRA-based syntheses of BCP derivatives, including ring-expanded (hetero)bioisosteres; ii) functionalize BCP products using a range of contemporary processes, including C–H or C–X activation; and iii) apply these methodologies to synthesize BCP drugs / natural product analogues, and to test their biological activity via an industrial collaboration.",False
"Title: TheHiggsAndThe7Tops - Mirror Mirror on the Wall, which Higgs is the oddest of them all: Exploring the Top-Higgs Interconnection with ATLAS Abstract: With the ground-breaking discovery of a new scalar particle, the Higgs boson, in 2012 by ATLAS and CMS, the standard model (SM) of particle physics has been completed. Despite this success, many open questions on the fundamental laws of nature remain unanswered. Among these are how exactly particles acquire their mass and why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe.

One of the most promising avenues to approach these questions is to explore the relation between the Higgs boson and the heaviest known elementary particle: the top quark. Due to its large mass, the top is expected to play a special role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. In order to shed light onto this mechanism, understanding the coupling between the top and the Higgs in great detail and exploring the charge and parity (CP) nature of the Higgs are essential. While the SM Higgs boson is CP-even, many models beyond the SM require a CP-odd component. Higgs-top couplings are expected to provide an unambiguous probe of CP-mixed states.

I will explore for the first time all processes in which a direct determination of the top-Higgs interconnection is feasible, in particular events where the Higgs is produced in association with 1, 2 and 4 top quarks. These are among the most challenging channels at the LHC. I will pioneer a comprehensive programme, consisting of the development of powerful event-reconstruction methods and improved boosting techniques, allowing the first exploitation of novel variables in a beyond-state-of-the-art cross-process analysis, thus unravel the CP-properties in the top-Higgs interaction.

The ultimate goal of the project is the precise direct measurement of the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling, and the first determination of the CP-nature of the Higgs boson in fermion interactions. Confronting these results with the SM and models that go beyond the SM will yield an unprecedented insight into the origin of mass of elementary particles.",False
"Title: ADAPTATION - Predicting adaptive responses of protected species to environmental changes to optimise conservation management frameworks in Europe Abstract: Environmental changes, including habitat loss and climate change, are negatively impacting biodiversity at global levels, with accelerating extinction rates of species. Whilst the EU Biodiversity Strategy aims to halt and then reverse these losses of species, data on the conservation status of many protected species is lacking, inhibiting their management. Effective conservation is reliant on robust data on protected species, yet there is a substantial knowledge gap between traditional monitoring methods that record abundances and conservation management frameworks that require the integration of species’ ecology with their adaptive responses to rapidly changing environments. The primary aim of this Fellowship is to thus deliver a novel conservation management framework for a model protected species, integrating ecological and genetic data, to provide a new predictive basis for European conservation management programmes. The sea lamprey Petromyson marinus is the model species, a protected species on Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive that provides multiple generations for testing the effects of environmental change on candidate genes. Research objectives quantify P. marinus European genetic diversity and structure, test for the presence of novel genetic mutations across populations, identify the genetic regions associated with adaptation to specific environmental parameters and develop an eco-evolutionary model of P. marinus population dynamics as the basis for its conservation management framework. As the project delivers highly innovative genetic and ecological research, it brings together a leading European researcher with high genetic knowledge with a European research group with exceptional expertise in conservation ecology. Together, their knowledge transfer and training activities will deliver novel conservation tools supporting European conservation strategies and launch a new research agenda in biodiversity and conservation management.",False
"Title: MULTIDRONE - MULTIple DRONE platform for media production Abstract: MULTIDRONE aims to develop an innovative, intelligent, multi-drone platform for media production to cover outdoor events, which are typically held over wide areas (at stadium/city level).  The 4-10 drone team, to be managed by the production director and crew, will have: a) increased decisional autonomy, by minimizing production crew load and interventions and b) improved robustness, security and safety mechanisms (e.g., embedded flight regulation compliance, enhanced crowd avoidance, autonomous emergency landing, communications security), enabling it to carry out its mission even against adverse conditions or crew inaction and to handle emergencies. Such robustness is particularly important, as the drone team has to operate close to crowds and may face an unexpected course of events and/or environmental hazards. Therefore, it must be contextually aware and adaptive with improved perception of crowds, individual people and other hazards. As this multi-actor system will be heterogeneous, consisting of multiple drones and the production  crew, serious human-in-the-loop issues will be addressed to avoid operator overload, with the goal of maximizing shooting creativity and productivity, whilst minimizing production costs. Overall, MULTIDRONE will boost research on multiple-actor systems by proposing novel multiple-actor functionalities and performance metrics. Furthermore, the overall multidrone system will be built to serve identified end user needs. Specifically, innovative, safe and fast multidrone audiovisual shooting will provide a novel multidrone cinematographic shooting genre and new media production techniques that will have a large impact on the financially important EU broadcasting/media industry.

"Title: INNOVATE - INtelligeNt ApplicatiOns oVer Large ScAle DaTa StrEams Abstract: Large scale data analytics is the key research domain for future data driven applications as numerous of devices produce huge volumes of data in the form of streams. Analytics services can offer the necessary basis for building intelligent decision making mechanisms to support novel applications. Due to the huge volumes of data, analytics should be based on efficient schemes for querying large scale data partitions. Partitions contain only a piece of data and a dedicated processor manages the incoming queries. The management of continuous queries over data streams is a challenging research issue requiring intelligent methods to derive the final outcome (i.e., query response) in limited time with maximum performance. The management process of continuous queries involves their assignment to specific processors and the processing of the derived responses. We focus on a group of query controllers serving the incoming queries and, thus, becoming the connection of big data systems with the real world. INNOVATE proposes solutions for the management of the controllers behavior. We propose an intelligent decision making process for each controller in three axes: (i) top-down, by realizing a mechanism that assigns queries to the underlying processors; (ii) bottom-up, by proposing decision making mechanisms for returning responses to users/applications on top of early results; (iii) horizontal, by proposing optimization schemes for queries management. We adopt a pool of learning schemes and an ensemble learning model dealing with how and on which processors each query should be assigned. We also propose specific schemes for combining processors responses. Intelligent and optimization techniques are adopted for the controllers group management. Machine learning, Computational Intelligence and optimization are the key adopted technologies that, when combined, provide efficient solutions to a challenging problem like the support of intelligent analytics over big data streams.",False
"Title: Finch Evo-Devo - Developmental Basis of Beak Shape Variation in Darwin’s Finches Abstract: Darwin’s finches display an extremely high beak shape diversity associated with occupation of various ecological niches. They are the classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection. The supervisor of this proposal – Dr. Arkhat Abzhanov and colleagues previously used a combination of morphometrics, comparative developmental genetic and functional tests to reveal basic principles underlying beak shape morphogenesis. They showed that the enormous beak diversity in Darwin’s finches could be reduced to three “group shapes” (A, B, and C) and revealed molecular mechanisms causing the scaling–based variation within group “A”, but not yet the processes underlying the more complex shear-based saltational transformation that produced variation between groups. 
The main objective of this project is to identify the developmental programs underlying the leaps of beak shape diversification during Darwin’s finches’ adaptive radiation – the variation between “group shapes”. I will employ an extensive whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) screen to search for novel transcripts whose gene expression is associated with the group shape-specific beak curvatures. This will be complemented with genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify upstream regulators of the actual effector molecules that cause the phenotype. I will validate the best candidates by gain- and loss-of-function tests using retroviral vectors on developing chicken and zebrafinch embryos to reveal their roles in beak morphogenesis. 
This project will provide novel insights on intrinsic mechanisms that facilitate adaptive morphological diversity, will offer an opportunity for interdisciplinary research interactions and will generate resources valuable to the entire biological community.",False

While its technology is still considered in the early stages of development, it is already mature in the video game area.
VR/AR has the potential to change the way we do business, social interactions or education, but its applicability beyond gaming requires further development. An important field of research is the audio part. The importance of sound becomes evident when considering how people orientate themselves in space. Unlike seeing, hearing allows us to perceive instantly from all angles, and plays a leading role in giving us clues where to look at. To support natural orientation in VR/AR, the visual and auditory information has to closely match, as otherwise the illusion is shattered and the experience is not convincing.
VRACE aims at providing physically correct and perceptually convincing soundscapes in VR. This goal is pursued through dedicated training of ESRs in all VR-related domains, namely physical modelling, sound propagation, audio rendering and psychoacoustics. Specific research projects involve modelling of sound sources, such as musical instruments, voices, vehicles, colliding objects or environmental sound sources, studying sound propagation in complex interior spaces like concert halls and in outdoor environments such as urban or rural areas and investigating human perception and localisation of sounds.
With an estimated revenue of $80bn by 2025 (G&S) the demand for trained VR audio experts will increase rapidly. Besides advancing methodologies in this cutting-edge technology, VRACE will train 15 ESRs who will multiply and spread this knowledge in industry and academia. VRACE thus gives European industry a competitive edge in this global race.",True

However, most of these interactions are still missing core human attributes – such as emotion, empathy, and nuance – that are critical to connection and understanding. Creating realistic avatars is hard and until today it has required large production teams of experienced artists, engineers and expensive software, being almost exclusively domain of Hollywood and AAA games.
All of the market conditions are present to create authentic virtual interactions through 3D avatars, but until now, there was no scalable way to deliver them. Didimo is the leading creator of high-fidelity digital humans – “didimo”. Our technology brings authenticity to virtual interactions. Didimo streamlines the production of characters at scale. From a single smartphone photo or scan our software creates a ready-to-animate avatar shortening the production process from hundreds of hours (at least 420) to less than a minute (30 seconds!).
Our software automates all stages of character creation into a one-click experience seamlessly embedded in our partners' apps. By integrating our software, in just a few seconds, our customers can deliver to their users a digital version of themselves – their “didimos”, that look, speak, and act like them – for use in a range of mixed reality experiences.
This 3D virtual self will be available to use in any digital environment, to improve everyday online interaction for all users, and to go one step further to address the pain points specific to online businesses and their customers.

"Title: DECADE - Deploying High Capacity Dense Small Cell Heterogeneous Networks Abstract: Broadband mobile networks are experiencing exponential traffic growth. It is predicted that this trend will continue in the next five to ten years with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 0.6 to 1.0. Hence the traffic (mostly data) carried by a mobile operator’s network in 2022 could be over 1000 times of that in 2012. This traffic growth presents a huge challenge to both the mobile industry and to academic researchers.

Along with increased spectrum efficiency, spectrum bandwidth expansion and traffic offloading through WiFi, small cell deployment is regarded as one of the most promising ways to meet the use of broadband mobile service in both outdoor and in particular indoor scenarios in the next decade. The deployment of small cells in a macrocell coverage area leads to a multi-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), in which a mix of access node types, such as macrocell, femtocell and relay, will co-exist. Despite the current research and development on small cell/HetNet from both industry and academia, there are still many challenges to be addressed and questions to be answered for successful small cell and HetNet deployment.

"Title: THERADNET - International NETwork for training and innovations in THErapeutic RADiation Abstract: Radiotherapy alone or in multimodality approaches is applied in 45-60% of all cancer patients, but despite technical innovations approximately only 50% are cured. Disease recurrence may be due to regrowth of the primary tumor or metastatic outgrowth. Intrinsic and acquired resistance of the tumor and adverse reactions in the co-irradiated surrounding normal tissues dampen a successful therapy outcome. Substantial improvements are now expected from biologically optimized, personalized radiotherapy. This network is built on the premises that integration of novel-emerging radiobiological and tumor-biological concepts into current standard-of-care will improve outcome of radiotherapy-treated cancer patients. As the field of radiobiology is small in individual countries, it is essential to cooperate on the European level to achieve a critical mass for innovation in research and training. 
The partners in this network will stimulate outstanding science to understand the plasticity of an altered tumor metabolism and tumor microenvironment, including the immune system, prior to, and in response to radiotherapy, as well as related dose-limiting adverse effects in normal tissues. Research and development of novel combined treatment modalities in these areas will be performed in models as close as possible to the clinical situation to evaluate their potential to widen the therapeutic window beyond standard-of-care. 
Students will benefit from outstanding expertise and collaborations within academia and industry integrating novel concepts into translational cancer and radiation research. This will guarantee high employability in various sectors of cancer research and precision medicine. The European community will benefit from the pursuit of innovative hypotheses, training of new researchers, and dissemination of knowledge. By combatting a major death-related disease in Europe, this project will raise health and bring long-term benefit to the European and international community.",False

Processing those data require rapidly provisioned infrastructures customised to Big Data requirements. 
The three main aims of the proposal will be:
- The development of innovative Big Data services for capturing, federating and annotating on the order of PB of data on top of efficient programming models. Despite that MapReduce is a successful model in BigData (with a high impact on massive Geo-spatial and textual data), it has many limitations specially when dealing with real-time transactions or streamed data, the proposal would aim to introduce innovative evolutions on the capture, federation & annotation experience it can bring to the table with its partners. 
- The Development of advanced cloud services to support Big Data. This cloud services will address three main challenges: a) the advance on SLAs to support privacy (boundaries of protected data to be moved) and performance restrictions (convenience of moving data to computing resources or vice-versa); b) Quality of Service (vertical and horizontal elastic adjustment of resources allocates to meet deadlines and dynamic adjustment of workloads); and c) Business models (price-based dynamic re-scheduling of data searching for the best usage of resources invested).

"Title: RADAR-CNS - Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse in Central Nervous System Disorders Abstract: Background: Long term conditions require monitoring of patients, traditionally conducted in the clinic, to monitor treatment effects, adverse events and disease course. This can be inefficient and cumbersome – clinic visits may be too infrequent to identify individuals at risk of significant changes in disease state (e.g. relapse) and place unnecessary burden on patients and providers.

Smartphone and wearable technologies have led to an exponential growth in the amount of information which can be collected on patients unobtrusively and at low cost. Sensors collect data passively, and active monitoring, using experience sampling, provides information on multiple parameters. Such technologies could monitor long term outcomes of patients, at scale, and provide fine-grained information on outcomes, available in real time and at low-cost, enabling services to offer more responsive and efficient care. 

Whilst there is growing interest in the application of RMT in health, the field is in its infancy. The private-public partnership fostered by IMI2 is an ideal way to overcome the inherent challenges of this field.

Our ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through remote assessment. To achieve this we will create a pipeline for developing, testing and implementing RMT in depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. The pipeline will include a data management and modelling infrastructure applicable to other disorders and with the flexibility of design to be future-proofed against further technological innovation. We will provide data on implementation barriers and facilitators gleaned from patients, clinicians, regulator and payers which will optimise the pathways for regulatory approval and uptake.

"Title: SWAPOUT - Smart Wireless Access Point with Objective User-Targeting Abstract: The aim of the project is to refine and bring to market a ground-breaking wireless local area network (WLAN) product capable of: a trebling of useable range, an order of magnitude improvement in coverage area, similar improvements in quality of service, capacity and achievable user data rates, together with a <5m accuracy single access point based user geolocation capability which simply does not exist in the market today. This will generate a new revenue stream for the operator which is largely untapped at present, due to the poor resolution (~100m) of the cellular geolocation information available today.

These benefits will result in up to two-thirds fewer access points being needed to cover a given area, reducing the cost of a typical 100-unit outdoor installation from around €1.3M to under €0.5M and further, on-going, cost reductions (e.g. electricity, site rental, maintenance), plus a two-thirds reduction in carbon footprint.

The product achieves these aims through the use of a revolutionary, ultra-low cost, highly dynamic, energy steering system, targeting the radio energy and receiver gain accurately and exclusively at an individual user, when transmitting or receiving that user’s data, moving in a few nanoseconds to other uses, on a data-frame by frame basis. This system utilises standard access point chipsets and standard, low-cost, off-the-shelf, components throughout its design. 

The global enterprise WLAN access point market is around €24Bn today and is dominated by three major players (all US-based), none of which is currently innovating in the wireless aspects of the system.  

The aim of the feasibility assessment is to:  generate a business plan which can be used to seek further investment; to engage with customers in order to identify which of the many product benefits is most applicable to them; to locate partners with whom we could engage to form a Phase 2 consortium and to pull together such a proposal; and to formulate an IP strategy.",True
"Title: LOMID - LOMID - Large cost-effective OLED microdisplays and their applications Abstract: The LOMID project will define pathways to the manufacture of flexible OLED microdisplays with an exceptionally large area (16 mm x 20 mm, screen diagonal of 25.4 mm) at acceptably high yields (>65%). 

This will be achieved by developing a robust silicon-based chip design allowing high pixel counts (1024x1280 (SXGA)) and high spatial resolution(pixel sizes of 10 µm x 10 µm corresponding to 2000 ppi). These display innovations will be coupled to a highly reliable manufacturing of the backplane. Cheap processes (e.g. based on 0.35 µm lithography) will be developed and special attention will be given to the interface between the top metal electrode of the CMOS backplane and the subsequent OLED layers. All these developments will be done on a 200 mm wafer scale. Along with this, a new testing procedure for quality control of the CMOS wafer (prior to OLED deposition) will be developed and promoted for standardisation. 

The flexibility of the large area microdisplays will be achieved by wafer thinning to enable a bending radius of 45 mm. Along with the new functionality, the durability of the devices has to be guaranteed despite bending to be comparable to rigid devices. The project will address this by improving the OLED efficiency (e.g. operating lifetime > 15,000 hours) and by modifying the device encapsulation to both fulfil the necessary barrier requirements (WVTR < 10^-6 g/d m2) and to give sufficient mechanical protection.
The demand for and timeliness of these flexible, large area microdisplays is shown by the strong interest of industrial integrators to demonstrate the benefits of the innovative OLED microdisplays. Within the project, industrial integrators will validate the project’s microdisplays in smart glasses for virtual reality and to aid those with impaired vision.",False
"Title: ALBORA - Next-generation navigation technologies for autonomous vehicles Abstract: One of the concepts that will drive the paradigm change in mobility is the Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV). Massive investments on the field and the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensors has moved relevant market uptakes for autonomous driving from 2035 to 2020. 
CAVs are equipped with a huge number of sensors that allow them to understand the environment and act accordingly. However, this technology is superfluous without knowing the location of the vehicle in real time. Technology used to position a mobile device on earth is known as Global Navigation Satellite System – GNSS (e.g. GPS or GALILEO). Despite it seems impossible, currently, there are not any GNSS solution that meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers for autonomous driving, due to: 1) excessive cost to be implemented at scale (low margin sector) 2) unavailability to provide location updates in real time under hostile GNSS conditions (e.g. urban canyons) and 3) lack of a reliability measure to detect when a location is not accurate enough. 
At Albora, we have built and patented the Albora Correlation Engine, which uses AI and, in particular, biologically inspired Deep Learning Networks to achieve the performance required by the sector. Moreover, our technology can be embedded on the electronics currently available on autonomous vehicles, allowing us to keep the costs extremely low (no additional HW required!)
To exploit our product, we plan to build SW packages of our algorithms and sell licenses through an easy to use API (SW company approach). This model is highly scalable and will allow us to tackle the huge market opportunity. In fact, SW will keep the largest market share for CAV, growing from €0.5 billion at 2015 to €25 billion in 2030. To this end, we need to assess the technical risks of migrating our code to more efficient programing languages, seek industrial partners to perform large pilots and fine-tune our business model using design thinking techniques.",True
"Title: 5G-CARMEN - 5G for Connected and Automated Road Mobility in the European UnioN Abstract: European mobility is drastically changing: growing urbanisation, environmental aspects, and safety are only a few of the key indicators pointing in this direction. Road infrastructures and vehicles are blending with the digital world, becoming always-connected, automated and intelligent, delivering optimal experience to passengers, and addressing societal goals (e.g., emission and accident reduction) and economic needs (e.g., vehicles as smart-living environments). In this respect, the European Union pushes for large-scale collaborative cross-border validation activities on cooperative, connected and automated mobility. 
5G-CARMEN addresses these challenges harnessing the concept of “Mobility Corridors”. In 5G-CARMEN important European industries, academics and innovative SMEs commit to achieve world-wide impact by conducting extensive trials across an important corridor (by people/goods traffic volumes), from Bologna to Munich, spanning 600 km of roads, connecting three European regions (Bavaria, Tirol and Trentino/South-Tyrol) across three countries. Vehicle manoeuvre negotiation (at various levels of automation), infotainment, and emission control in sensitive areas are the cross-border use cases targeted by 5G-CARMEN pilots in order to maximise the project commercial, societal, end environmental impact.
The project will build a 5G-enabled corridor to conduct cross-border trials and will deploy a mixture of 5G micro- and macro-cells for ubiquitous C-V2X connectivity. The 5G New Radio will be used to support latency sensitive and/or bandwidth hungry services and applications. The project will leverage on a distributed mobile edge cloud spanning from the vehicle itself to the centralised cloud.

"Title: is3DMIMO - indoor small-cell Networks with 3D MIMO Array Antennas Abstract: It is predicted that wireless network traffic will increase 1000 times in the next decade. The exponential traffic growth is not uniform across geographical areas and mainly takes place in indoor hot spots. Hence, high capacity indoor venues represent the biggest network capacity increase challenge.

The recently emerged 3D MIMO technology provides a promising dimension to provide extra capacity gain in hot spots. In particular, the 3D deployment of small cells (SCs) equipped with 3D MIMO antenna arrays will take advantage of 3D distribution of user equipment (UE) in typical high capacity venues, and represents an excellent technical combination to address the indoor high capacity challenge. The 3D deployment of SCs with 3D MIMO antenna arrays faces technical challenges ranging from 3D MIMO antenna array design, performance evaluation, the lack of understanding of 3D MIMO SC network performance limits to the optimal 3D SC network deployment.

The is3DMIMO project aims to address these technical challenges by assembling a team of four partners in the UK, Sweden and China with complementary expertise. During the project, the is3DMIMO consortium aims to achieve the following objectives:
•	characterize and model indoor 3D MIMO channels for typical indoor environments;
•	develop a reliable OTA antenna characterization method for 3D MIMO SCs;
•	characterize OTA performance in laboratory conditions as compared to real-life 3D MIMO small cell scenarios;
•	obtain fundamental understanding of the network performance gains achievable by 3D SCs with 3D MIMO antenna arrays;
•	develop techniques for jointly optimizing the deployment locations of SC access points (APs) and their 3D MIMO configurations; and
•	provide 3D MIMO SC network planning and deployment guidelines for typical 3D indoor scenarios. 
The achievement of the above objectives will provide crucial inputs for multiple-antenna and 5G/B5G system design, and will increase network capacity in indoor hot spots by 20-30%.",True
"Title: FLASH - Far-infrared Lasers Assembled using Silicon Heterostructures Abstract: The THz part of the electromagnetic spectrum (0.3-10 THz) is currently exploited in commercial security screening systems (weapon detection beneath clothes), medical diagnostics tools (skin and breast cancer, burns, and in ophthalmology) and production-line monitoring (non-destructive test in the pharmaceutical industry). Existing sources of THz radiation are still too large and expensive to be a massively deployed in all of the existing and proposed applications, which include large bandwidth wireless communications and the extension of security screening to far-infrared spectroscopic identification of chemicals and explosives up to 10 THz. A lower production cost, a higher level of integration with control electronics, and a broader range of emitted wavelength are all desirable to expand the application of THz radiation.
FLASH, will develop a room-temperature THz laser integrated on Si using CMOS technology-compatible processes and materials. The laser, of quantum cascade type, will be assembled using newly developed conduction-band germanium-rich heterostructures. It will leverage on the non-polar nature of silicon and germanium crystal lattices to potentially enabling room temperature operation, and will emit over 1 mW of power in the 1-10 THz range. In perspective, the development of the SiGe heterostructure platform will pave the way towards the new field of nonlinear silicon photonics based on band-structure engineering. The consortium includes EU leaders in silicon chip manufacturing, Si/SiGe/Ge epitaxial material growth, laser and band structure modelling, quantum cascade laser design and terahertz/infrared spectroscopy.

"Title: DARKHORIZONS - Dark Matter and the Early Universe in the LHC Era Abstract: The discovery of a Higgs like particle in its first science run shows that we are truly in the LHC era and when collisions resume we will learn more about the physics of the TeV scale.  

There are two main areas at the interface of particle physics and cosmology that the LHC will shed light on - If dark matter is a thermal relic then we naturally expect new particle physics close to this TeV energy range.  The LHC will also help us learn about the nature of the electroweak sector and its behaviour during the early Universe.

In this proposal we present a body of work which will combine information from the LHC with dark matter experiments and astronomical observations to understand both the nature of dark matter and the role of the Higgs sector in the first moments after the big bang.  

We will investigate dark matter by developing a new categorisation of interactions between the dark sector and the standard model.  This will enable us to perform detailed collider and direct detection phenomenology in a more comprehensive way than current approaches while avoiding the problems which occur when those methods breakdown.  Different schemes for mitigating against the upcoming problem of the neutrino floor in direct detection experiments will also be investigated.

Many of the keys to understanding the particle nature of dark matter lie in astrophysics, and we will develop new techniques to understand the distribution of dark matter in the Universe, its behaviour and density in distant galaxies and its velocity dispersion in the Solar system, critical to predict event rates in detectors.

We will use LHC and CMB data to answer important questions - Can the electroweak phase transition be first order?  What is the role of the Higgs field during inflation?  Can we use the electroweak sector to infer information about physics at high energy scale or the nature of inflation?

"Title: MICA - Mechanics of slow earthquake phenomena: an Integrated perspective from the Composition, geometry, And rheology of plate boundary faults Abstract: Major tectonic faults have, until recently, been thought to accommodate displacement by either continuous creep or episodic, damaging earthquakes. High-resolution geophysical networks have now detected ‘slow earthquakes’, transient modes of displacement that are faster than creep but slower than earthquakes. This project aims to illuminate the unknown mechanism behind slow earthquakes, through an integrated, multi-scale approach. MICA uses the unique natural laboratory of exhumed and active faults, to build numerical models constrained by observed fault geometry and microstructurally defined deformation mechanisms, to determine, for the first time, the rheology of slow slip.

The first objective is to create a model of the slow earthquake source, to constrain the micro- to kilometre-scale internal geometry of plate boundary faults, and the spatial distribution of deformation mechanisms. Fault rocks also retain a deformation sequence, allowing insight to how deformation style evolves with time. Thus, a combination of drill samples from active faults and outcrops of exhumed analogues, from a range of depths, allows for a 4-D model from micro- to plate boundary scale.

By knowing the geometrical distribution of fault rocks, and deciphering their evolution in time, this project will apply geologically constrained numerical models and laboratory constrained stress-strain relationships to determine bulk fault rheology as a function of space. Unique from past models, this project integrates scales from microstructures to plate boundary scale faults, and bases rheological models on deformation mechanisms and fault structures constrained through detailed fieldwork, and also considers the state-of-the-art of geophysical observation. The model focuses on understanding slow earthquakes, but also applies to understanding whether the slow earthquake source can also host fast seismic slip, and what differentiates slowly slipping faults from faults hosting major earthquakes.",False
"Title: INTEGRAL - INitiative to bring the 2nd generation of ThermoElectric Generators into industrial ReALity Abstract: Thermoelectric materials have been studied for several decades now. Improved TE materials are emerging with the so-called second-generation thermoelectric (GEN2 TE) materials: silicides and half-Heusler. These materials are low-cost, based on most earth-abundant elements and eco-friendly materials, and can impact positively European industry and society by converting wasted heat into electricity. 
As GEN2 TE materials are attracting a growing interest, pilot lines resulting from partnerships between public research institutes, industrial research teams and SME are emerging in Europe. 
The aim of the INTEGRAL project is to upscale the GEN2 TE material technology using existing pilot lines and growing SMEs, in order to address mass markets TE needs (automotive, heavy duty trucks, autonomous sensors and industry waste heat recovery). The INTEGRAL project is unique since it gathers in a complete value chain the major companies (including SMEs and startups) developing GEN2 TE advanced materials in Europe and cutting-edge research centers. INTEGRAL will allow the industry to step up towards advanced manufacturing and commercialization of systems integrating multifunctional TE materials (on a nano-based approach), through material customization, next techniques for characterization and process control and up-scaled pilot-line demonstrations of reliability, reproducibility and mastered material consumption. Furthermore, the large-scale processes which will be developed for producing nanostructured materials within the INTEGRAL project will explore a wider range of applications outside thermoelectrics, in particular where customization of electrical or thermal properties of sintered or casted materials are needed. Finally, a technology transfer will be performed from research activities to pilot-lines, towards the commercialization of the new generation of advanced materials with a circular economy vision.",False

"Title: EMPOWER - EMPOWERING a reduction in use of conventionally fueled vehicles using Positive Policy Measures. Abstract: The main objective of EMPOWER is to substantially reduce the use of conventionally fueled vehicles (CFV) in cities by influencing the mobility behaviour of CFV drivers and users towards fundamental change. To achieve this objective EMPOWER will create a set of tools for industry, policy makers and employers. These will empower them beyond the lifespan of this project to understand, help choose and successfully implement ‘positive’ evidence-based and cost-effective policy interventions, based on new and innovative mobility services, and in the context of already existing infrastructure, policy and measures. EMPOWER will reduce the use of CFV by: shifting trips to other modes/other vehicle types, promoting sharing and self-organisation and reducing demand overall e.g. through remote access to services. Undesirable impacts from CFV use will be reduced by: shifting CFV use to outside peak times and diversions to avoid particular areas/routes. The research will be multidisciplinary and involve: social science research with the public, 4 living lab experiments and 7 City demonstrators which will be chosen through an open 'bidding' process. The EMPOWER concept will be used in practice by: City stakeholders being able (through a software tool) to choose positive policy options based on their expected impacts and deliver incentives and social network sharing schemes to individuals using software. The innovation outputs of EMPOWER include an EMPOWER Toolkit to support industry, policy makers and employers to understand, choose and implement positive policy interventions. The Toolkit includes: new mobility services to provide innovative positive policy measures, new evidence on behavioural responses and impacts from positive incentives, improved organisational models for successful implementation of positive policy measures and innovation in the evaluation methodology for new mobility services.

"Title: interACT - Designing cooperative interaction of automated vehicles with other road users in mixed traffic environments Abstract: There is currently a high desire by manufacturers to introduce Automated Vehicles (AVs), SAE level 3 and above, to the market. As AVs are likely to be deployed in mixed traffic, they need to interact safely and efficiently with other (non-equipped) users, including manually driven vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. Although obstacle detection by AVs is almost flawless, these vehicles cannot communicate their intentions to other road users. This limitation currently reduces their appeal and value to the user. To ensure intuitive and cooperative interaction between the AV and others, and a smooth flow of all traffic, it is essential that there is good means of communication between all actors. The main objective of interACT is to substantially improve this communication and cooperation strategy. interACT will provide an overview of current human-machine interactions in mixed traffic, and increase chances of safe deployment of AVs by developing novel software and HMI hardware components for reliable and user-centric communication between an AV with its users. interACT will: 
1) Use social-psychological models to compile a catalogue of interactions, identifying the main communication needs of road users in current and future traffic scenarios 
2) Improve software algorithms and sensor capabilities for assessing intention recognition and behaviour prediction of surrounding road users 
3) Use a Cooperation and Communication Planning Unit to integrate planning algorithms, providing synchronized and integrated communication protocols 
4) Ensure safety of road users by developing easy-to-verify software for a safety layer, and novel methods for fail-safe trajectory planning. 
Prototypes will be developed and evaluated in multi-actor simulators and two test vehicles, assessing ease-of-use, acceptance, safety and reliability. The impact of this successful communication on reduction of crashes, improvement of traffic flow and acceptance of AVs by society will be investigated.",True
"Title: realTRIPS - Redefining Variability: Evaluating Land Use and Transport Impacts on Urban Mobility Patterns Abstract: Urban mobility analysis, advanced by the emerging fine-granularity location data (e.g. smart card data, mobile phone data and social media data), has received significant attention in recent years. It has become an important subject for understanding the functionality, ever-increasing dynamism and complexity of urban space. realTRIPS aims to open a new avenue of research in urban mobility analysis using emerging automatic data by developing an analytical and modelling framework, particularly addressing variability across spatial-temporal scales. I argue that the variability of urban mobility should not be simply interpreted as a number of errors, but indicators of changes in regular human behaviours impacted by land use and transport at different scales. A deeper understanding of variability and regularity would contribute to a more accurate prediction of urban development scenarios. The relevant theories and measures on variability have been long-researched in spatial statistics, but not well applied to the context of urban mobility studies. The proposed framework will take advantage of the research progress in multi-disciplines and leverage key concepts from uncertainty in spatial analysis, time geography, and land use transport planning. Under such framework, variability will be measured in mobility patterns and integrated as a function of space and time into operational urban models for predicting impact of land use and transport on people’s travel and location choices at different spatiotemporal scales. Case studies presenting typical urban contexts (i.e. London, Shenzhen, Nairobi) will be explored to demonstrate the feasibility and generic applicability of the theory, analytical methods and urban models.",True

Focusing on the hardcore issue of multi-wavelength regeneration “how to reduce nonlinear crosstalk for spectrally efficient advanced modulation signals”, the Fellow proposes pioneering concepts including novel nonlinear devices (nonlinear multi-core fibres and phase-sensitive parametric oscillator units), new crosstalk suppression methods (spatial-division-multiplexing and bidirectional oscillation methods). The resulting regeneration subsystems will dramatically reduce cost and power consumption by combining the nonlinear processing with high-speed multiplexing. Finally, the system testing will demonstrate a multi-wavelength (>8 channels), multi-phase-shift-keying (MPSK) signal regeneration in a commercial network, which offers a high-capacity and green technology alternative to core switching nodes.

"Title: PROTECTIVE - Proactive Risk Management  through Improved Cyber Situational Awareness Abstract: PROTECTIVE is designed to improve an organisations ongoing awareness of the risk posed to its business by cyber security attacks. PROTECTIVE makes two key contributions to achieve this enhanced situational awareness. Firstly it increases the computer security incident response team’s (CSIRT) threat awareness through improved security monitoring and increased sharing of threat intelligence between organisations within a community. Secondly it ranks critical alerts based on the potential damage the attack can inflict on the threatened assets and hence to the organisations business. High impact alerts that target important hosts will have a higher priority than other alerts. Through the combination of these two measures organisations are better prepared to handle incoming attacks, malware outbreaks and other security problems and to guide the development of the prevention and remediation processes.
The PROTECTIVE system is designed to provide solutions for public domain CSIRTs and SME’s who both have needs outside the mainstream of cyber security solution provision. Public CSIRTs needs arise in part because commercial tools do not address their unique requirements. This has created a shortfall, clearly articulated by ENISA, of tools with the required analytical and visualisation capabilities to enable public CSIRTs provide optimised services to their constituency. SME’s also are vulnerable to cybercrime as they have limited resources to protect themselves and often a limited understanding of what needs to be done.

"Title: RAPID - Heterogeneous Secure Multi-level Remote Acceleration Service for Low-Power Integrated Systems and Devices Abstract: Many low-power devices such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks as well as several other embedded systems can't always cope with the increased demand for processing power, memory and storage required by modern applications in gaming, vision, security, robotics, aerospace, etc. As a result, most such applications are only executed on high-end servers.

RAPID tackles this challenge by taking advantage of high-performance accelerators and high-bandwidth networks. Following our approach, compute or storage intensive tasks are seamlessly offloaded from the low-power devices to more powerful heterogeneous accelerators, supporting multiple virtual CPUs and GPUs. We propose, for the first time, a secure unified model where almost any device or infrastructure, ranging from smartphone, notebook, laptop and desktop to private and public cloud can operate as an accelerated entity and/or as an accelerator serving other less powerful devices in a secure way.

RAPID offers a registration mechanism, which permits the accelerated entities to automatically find and connect to nearby accelerators with the required resources. Next, a runtime system, running on each such accelerated entity, takes into account several parameters such as the local status, the environmental conditions, the task requirements, and the status of the accelerators it is connected to in order to decide whether local tasks (or incoming tasks if the entity also acts as an accelerator) should be executed locally or remotely. Novel scheduling algorithms, admission control policies, Service Level Agreements and license policies are employed to serve multiple accelerated applications efficiently on heterogeneous cloud infrastructures.

An easy-to-use task-based programming model will be defined, while a novel runtime will automatically offload and execute the tasks transparently to the programmer. Within the RAPID project the first public acceleration cloud service will become available and commercially exploitable.",True
"Title: COIN - Coding for Optical communications In the Nonlinear regime Abstract: The rapid increase in data traffic in the past years and traffic forecasts will lead to capacity exhaust in the optical fibre communications infrastructure which carries over 95% of all data services. The optical fibre channel is nonlinear, that is, its properties, namely its refractive index, is dependent on optical intensity, and at high power densities, the combination of nonlinear effects and dispersion leads to nonlinear distortion, limiting both achievable capacities, spectral efficiencies and distances. A key research area requiring investigation is nonlinear coding and detection, tailored to the nonlinear channel to dramatically improve the data throughput of future optical networks. New R&D is critically needed not only for finding new native nonlinear communication techniques but also transferring them into practical, error-resilient systems. The COIN objective is, thus, the development of a new area of nonlinear communications including forward error correction, essential for reliable communication. Specifically, COIN will investigate the application of nonlinear Fourier transforms and nonlinearity-tailored coding and detection by effectively integrating the scientific expertise of the key academic research groups in information theory, coding, coherent optical communication and high-speed transmission with the industrial know-how of the consortium. The COIN R&D goals will be to focus on the development of new, native communication schemes and waveforms alongside with the development of coding schemes for these and existing non-linear Fourier transform based transceivers. The R&D tasks will be carried out along with researcher training in the leading scientific centres in Europe. The PhD training programme is designed to maximize the unique synergy between the collaborators to promote career opportunities of the COIN researchers in ICT, generating new types of key expertise and and human capital for the European Research Area.",True
"Title: 5GCITY - 5GCITY Abstract: Delivering on the 5G promise of increased data rates, and ubiquitous coverages, poses stringent requirements on traditional vertically integrated operators. In particular, telecom operators are expected to massively  roll out Small Cells, which requires finding appropriate urban spaces with both backhaul and energy availability. Network sharing becomes essential to unlock those commercial massive deployments. The open access model, or neutral host, will come to play a key role on the deployment of 5G networks, especially in urban scenarios where very dense Small Cell deploymens are required. 
In parallel recent trends are paving the way towards the development of new, heterogeneous and distributed cloud paradigms that significantly differ from today’s established cloud model: with edge computing, cloud architectures are pushed all the way to the edge of the network, close to the devices that produce and act on data. We posit that there are two sets of players perfectly poised to take advantage of both trends since they already own the infrastructure needed to build edge deployments: telecommunication providers and municipalities. 5GCity focuses on how common smart city infrastructure (i.e.,small cells and processing power at the very edge of networks) can bring benefit to both players based on resource sharing and end-to-end virtualization, pushing the cloud model to the extreme edge. 
5GCity will design, develop, deploy and demonstrate a distributed cloud and radio platform for municipalities and infrastructure owners acting as 5G neutral hosts. 5GCity’s main aim is to build and deploy a common, multi-tenant, open platform that extends the (centralized) cloud model to the extreme edge of the network, with a demonstration in three different cities (Barcelona, Bristol and Lucca). 5GCity will directly impact a large and varied range of actors: (i) telecom providers; (ii) municipalities; and (iii) a number of different vertical sectors utilizing the city infrastructure",True
"Title: InPulse - Indium-Phosphide Pilot Line for up-scaled, low-barrier, self-sustained, PIC ecosystem Abstract: InP photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer game changing performance capabilities across multiple market sectors. Alas, the possibilities have so far been restricted to a small number of vertically-integrated technology businesses. Europe boasts tens of innovative businesses who are positioned to develop PIC-enabled technologies , but – alas again – they do not have access to mature,  fast-turnaround predictable, high performance production. 

InPulse is a manufacturing pilot line for InP PICs which will transform the PIC industry from a vertically integrated model with all skills in-house within a small number of specialized businesses, to an open-access horizontal model accessible to all European innovators. InPulse puts in place the technological and operational processes to: 
1)	Accelerate the uptake of PIC technology in new markets: enabling SMEs to create tens of products in markets where PICs have not be used before.
2)	Enable sustainable production in Europe creating aligned, scalable and inter-locking services and value chains
3)	Accelerate time to market from years to under 24 months with predictive design for fewer and faster product design cycles
4)	Qualify foundry processes, to TRL7, sharing process optimization across products

InPulse combines low entrance-threshold, mature-manufacturing to enable tens of European PIC innovators.
 InPulse is validated by:
•	A “Pilot Line Validation Program” with two Participants stretching performance 
•	A “Demonstrator Open Call” program enabling external users to take thirty designs to pre-production 
•	High frequency open access calls, sustainable beyond the end of the project 

InPulse partners have played a pioneering role in open access InP PICs, creating an infrastructure for research and early stage development. We are very well positioned to enable high TRL development in a scalable design kit driven process driving open access InP PICs from proof of concept to industrial prototyping and pre-production.",False
"Title: EFT4NP - Probing New Physics at the Large Hadron Collider: the Effective Field Theory Pathway Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is hunting for signs of New Physics (NP) in the vast amount of data collected by its experiments. If new states are heavier than the collider energy reach, their presence can be revealed by modifications of the interactions of the known particles. The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) parametrises such deviations from the SM, extending the sensitivity to scales beyond those directly probed at colliders. Determining the parameters of the EFT will shed light on the nature of NP and will provide hints to the most important questions in particle physics, such as the shape of the Higgs potential, its relation to electroweak baryogenesis and the amount of CP-violation and its connection to the matter-anti-matter asymmetry. A dedicated campaign of measurements and their SMEFT interpretation is a major goal of the LHC and requires coordination between experimentalists and theorists.   

I aim at making essential beyond the state-of-the-art theoretical contributions to the LHC SMEFT programme by:  
1) Providing the first fully generic next-to-leading order QCD and electroweak Monte Carlo implementation of SMEFT operators, to allow theorists and experimentalists to perform realistic simulations.    
2) Combining accurate SMEFT predictions with LHC data to constrain the operators through a novel robust global determination. The findings, particularly if different from the SM expectations, will point to the scale and nature of NP.   
3) Exploring new challenging proposals, such as i) the impact of operator running and mixing and ii) the optimisation of ways of extracting the Higgs self-coupling and probing CP-violation at the LHC, two topics with profound implications for our theoretical understanding of particle physics.    

The proposal plays to a key strength of my research expertise and my research record uniquely positions me to successfully lead this ambitious project, which is vital to exploit the full LHC potential.",False

"Title: TeraApps - Doctoral Training Network in Terahertz Technologies for Imaging, Radar and Communication Applications Abstract: Our future world will be one of ubiquitous sensor systems - a “Real World Web” where billions of devices, machines, or “things” will connect to the internet. In 2008, more machines were connected to the internet than there are humans on the planet, and by 2020 there are predicted to be 50 billion machines connected to the internet. As a consequence, there will be an ever-increasing hunger for communications bandwidth, both at a local level within an office or apartment, and at nodes within data centres and server farms. The terahertz (THz) band is yet to be exploited, and occupies frequencies from 0.3 to 3 GHz (1mm to 100um) occupying a middle ground between microwaves and infrared light. THz technologies are also set to revolutionize a range of imaging, sensing, and quantum optics applications.
Recently, tunneling devices have been shown to be the leading candidate in realizing compact, low cost, high performance THz transmitters and receivers once coupled to suitable antennas. Also, new two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene or 1D nanowires are emerging as suitable platforms for realising highly sensitive detectors of THz radiation.  These emerging research areas link e.g. semiconductor materials synthesis, high speed electronic device physics and engineering, antenna design, THz optics, and a raft of diverse applications. A new generation of academic and industry leaders in developing these devices and systems in the terahertz spectral band is now required. However, the research community is dispersed, and this highly multi-disciplinary field requires specialist training.
This network addresses this future societal need by addressing this training gap, and crystallising world leading groups in a concentrated research effort.

"Title: Inno4Vac - Innovations to accelerate vaccine development and manufacture Abstract: Inno4Vac proposes an ambitious programme that will harness the latest advances in immunology, disease modelling, and modelling for tackling persistent scientific bottlenecks in vaccine development and for de-risking and accelerating this process. To reach this aim the project is divided into  four interlinked subtopics. In Subtopic 1, artificial intelligence in combination with big data analysis and computational modelling will be used to build an open-access and cloud-based platform for in silico vaccine efficacy assessment and development. Subtopic 2 will develop new and improved controlled human infection models (CHIM) against influenza, RSV and C. difficile that will enable early vaccine efficacy evaluation. Subtopic 3 will contribute to the development of cell-based human in vitro 3D models that resemble the in vivo situation of an infection at the mucosa and more reliably predict immune protection. These models will be combined with the development of related functional immune assays for clinically relevant (surrogate) endpoints. Finally, Subtopic 4 will develop a modular one-stop computational platform for in silico modelling of vaccine bio-manufacturing and stability testing. 
In parallel to the scientific-technical work, the partners will develop strategies and roadmaps for positioning the newly developed models in the regulatory framework and integrating them into pharmaceutical vaccine development. The overall workplan is underpinned by horizontal activities on coordination/management and dissemination/communication, including data management and future sustainability.
To achieve these ambitious objectives, Inno4Vacc has assembled a multidisciplinary consortium from academic and research institutions, industries, regulatory bodies, and vaccine R&D alliances.

"Title: ADC - Next-Generation Antibody-Drug Conjugates for safer and more effective cancer therapies Abstract: Oncolinx has developed a novel molecular platform allowing for non-invasive and highly effective cancer cures. The platform carries a killing drug (Azonafide), linked to an antibody, specifically targeting and destroying only malignant tumour cells. These molecular complexes are called Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and represent a strong, valid alternative to current chemotherapies. Oncolinx’s innovative linker/payload technology enables the Azonafide platform to perform a sensitive discrimination between healthy and cancer cells, thereby avoiding adverse side-effects of chemotherapy. ADCs enhance the effectiveness of a systemic treatment and have the advantage of targeting only tumour sites within the same therapy. Oncolinx’s drugs are effective against drug resistant cancers, as well as cancer stem cells (CSCs)—cells directly responsible for drug-resistance, metastasis, and relapse. In addition, Oncolinx’s technology activates the immune system against the tumour, which is an integral hallmark of durable responses. Although Oncolinx’s platform is designed to be adopted for drug-resistant breast cancers as first application, the Azonafide payload potency has been validated across all NCI-60 cell lines screening for different tumour types. The NCI-60 Human Tumour Cell Lines Screen also showed that the Azonafide payload, when conjugated with Oncolinx linker technology to specific antibodies, can kill up to 98.2% of cancer cells while remaining non-toxic to cells that do not express the antigen. NCI-60 screening has shown subnanomolar-picomolar potency across cancers  (1x10-9M). While a variety of ADCs compound are currently developed and tested, only two ADCs have been approved so far. However, because Azonafide platform has a unique mechanism of action, Oncolinx can exclusively target slow growing cancers, drug resistant cancers, and other cancers that cannot be treated by the technologies of the two competitors (Seattle Genetics and ImmunoGen).",False
"Title: ULTRAWAVE - Ultra capacity wireless layer beyond 100 GHz based on millimeter wave Traveling Wave Tubes Abstract: For the first time, smartphones and tablets data usage exceeds desktops. This is a wake up call for manufacturers and operators to provide users with ubiquitous, high speed and high quality wireless coverage. The 5G cell densification is the only available route due to the constraints of sub-6GHz networks. A dense deployment of small cells requires a capillary backhaul and novel approaches to fronthaul. While the increase of data rate at small cell level has found solutions, the quest for high-density backhaul remains still unanswered. The fiber is too expensive and of difficult deployment. The wireless backhaul is the preferred solution for operators for performance, flexibility and cost. The traffic demand requires an upshift from microwave to high capacity millimeter wave backhaul, and overcome the current technology limits. ULTRAWAVE responds to the challenge of high capacity, high cell density backhaul by proposing, for the first time, the exploitation of the whole millimeter wave spectrum beyond 100 GHz. This will be used to create an ultra capacity layer providing more than 100 Gbps per kilometer square in Point to Multi point at D-band (141 – 174.8 GHz) over 500 m radius of coverage, fed by novel G-band (300 GHz) Point to Point high capacity links with more than 600 m range. The ULTRAWAVE system is empowered by the convergence of three main technologies: vacuum electronics, solid-state electronics and photonics in a unique wireless system, with transmission power at Watt level at millimeter waves, generated by novel traveling wave tubes. The ULTRAWAVE consortium includes five top Academic institutions and three high technology SMEs from five European countries. The vast capacity, flexibility and easy deployment of the ULTRAWAVE layer will enable backhaul of hundreds of small and pico cells, no matter the density, and will open scenarios so far not conceivable for new networks paradigms and architectures aiming at a full 5G implementation.",True
"Title: iCIRRUS - intelligent Converged network consolIdating Radio and optical access aRound USer equipment. Abstract: To meet the high throughput demands envisaged for 5G networks, with increased user densification and bandwidth-hungry applications, while at the same time reducing energy consumption, iCIRRUS proposes an intelligent Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) that brings together optical fibre technology, low-cost but highly flexible Ethernet networking, wireless resource management for device-to-device (D2D) communication (incl. the use of mm-wave spectrum) and the use of virtual mobiles in the cloud. The iCIRRUS C-RAN introduces the use of Ethernet in the fronthaul/midhaul (for radio signal transport), to minimise cost and make available pluggable and in-device monitoring, and intelligent processing to enable self-optimizing network functions which maximise both network resource utilisation and energy efficiency. To exemplify the attractiveness of the proposition, iCIRRUS focusses on D2D communication in the wireless domain, an important work area in current standardisation, where low latency is known to be a significant factor. The latency and jitter in the iCIRRUS Ethernet-based C-RAN will be an important focus of the research work in the project, with current 5G performance targets in mind; for D2D communications, the task will be to minimise control latency and overhead. A major obstacle for C-RANs is the bit-rate of the digitised radio signals that would be required for 5G – of the order of 100 Gb/s and iCIRRUS will examine the architectural and technological questions surrounding this requirement. Wireless resource management will be investigated, together with mobile device caching and mm-wave D2D mesh networks, to reduce latency as well as load on the infrastructure. Finally, the intelligent network functions in ICIRRUS can interact with mobile cloud processing, and further offloads of infrastructure communications can be realised through virtualising mobiles in the cloud as clones, and performing communication tasks between clones.",True
"Title: SWARM - Software driven Smart Antenna powered by RF MEMS Technology Abstract: Sofant's disruptive SmartAntenna innovation is based on a patent-protected programmable RF MEMS (Radio Frequency – Micro Electro Mechanical System). This results in significant energy usage reduction (up to 90%) and up to doubling of  battery life within the mobile device while, at the same time, achieving best signal strength consistency through a focused link to the transmission mast. Battery life and connectivity are key problems for the rapidly growing global mobile wireless communication market. With increased specification - 20-megapixel camera, large display, thin form factor (only 8 mm thick), 4G LTE and upcoming 5G, 13 frequency bands and five operating modes, these are features that consumers demand in their smartphone. Antennae account for a significant portion of power consumption and battery usage within mobile devices. As screen sizes and device usage increases, there is more pressure on battery performance, in conflict with a desire to produce lighter and more compact devices. At least 50% of smartphone power is consumed by the antenna and communication systems while the screen is off and at least 35% when the screen is on but during a call, power consumption rises to almost 80%. Sofant is developing an intelligent Antenna, ‘SmartAntenna’™ to address connectivity issues for the global expansion in mobile communication. Sofant’s addressable markets are in the mobile phone, routers, base stations, small cells, consumer electronics, automotive and defence equipment sectors. The mobile market is expected to grow from 1 billion to 2 billion units within the next 3 years and mobile 5G infrastructure is expected to reach US$2 billion by 2019.

"Title: PREDICT - A new era in personalised medicine: Radiomics as decision support tool for diagnostics and theragnostics in oncology Abstract: The high degree of tumour (genomic and phenotypic) heterogeneity influences patient’s response to therapy and hampers wide deployment of personalised medicine for cancer treatment. Thus, there is an imperative need for new technologies that can accurately detect tumour heterogeneity, allow for patient stratification and assist clinicians in providing the right diagnosis and treatment for the right patient. PREDICT’s mission is to address this huge unmet need.
Radiomics, a newly emerging field that uses high-throughput extraction of large amounts of features from radiographic images, can boost the field of personalised medicine. The analysis of medical images taken as standard-of-care allows Radiomics to capture tumour heterogeneity and to generate ‘tumour-specific’ signatures in a non-invasive way, without the need of assessing the patient’s genetic profile. Thus, Radiomics, if linked to Big- data and decision support systems (DSS), can be used as diagnostic tool for patient stratification, for prediction of treatment response and for guidance, involving the patient, of clinical decisions in oncology. However, researchers that understand cancer biology, advanced imaging and big data analytics are virtually absent. Even more challenging is to translate the outcomes into actual clinical tools involving the patient.
PREDICT will train 15 highly promising researchers in the emerging field of Radiomics and Big data. These ESRs will be trained to implement the automatic exploitation of large amounts of imaging data to drive decision-making algorithms that will guide diagnosis and treatment of different types of cancer and to develop ‘tumour-specific’ signatures integrated in multifactorial DSS. The ESRs will become experts and innovators in Radiomics, Big Data and DSS, which will allow them to bring unique solutions towards the clinic.

Currently, large-scale production of plant protein based plastic alternatives is hampered by a lack of advanced knowledge of the phase behaviour of plant proteins. This research programme thus aims to for the first time systematically investigate the key phase transition of plant proteins — thermal phase transition and phase separation. This objective will be achieved by uniting two sets of skills: i) the Experienced Researcher’s expertise in plant protein self-assembly and ii) specialized knowledge of chemists, engineers and business management at Xampla Ltd for the commercially successful application of plant protein materials. The breakthrough aspect will be uniting traditional polymer science regarding phase transition and molecular understanding of proteins – the obtained materials can be manufactured using established industrial platform used for polymer processing. The approach thus makes the products competitive with current bio-based polymeric materials in market, or even synthetic plastic materials.

Indeed, while important steps have been taken in the past, the annual global extraction of materials tripled in the last 50 years and is expected to increase further. The dual transformation, green and digital, place special emphasis on resource and energy intensive sectors. Furthermore, the expected zero pollution action plan for air, water and soil will enforce this transformation. In this changing environment, industry will have to adapt swiftly and decisively but the ease and smoothness of this transition is up for debate.

"Title: ZAP - ZAPINAMO – Affordable, future-proof rapid charging infrastructure for electric vehicles from stored [clean and economical] energy Abstract: The European Environment Agency’s ‘Air Quality in Europe 2016 Report’ attributes air pollution to over 467,000 premature deaths across Europe every year. The total economic cost of premature deaths in the WHO European Region has been estimated at €1.47 trillion each year. Emissions from petrol and particularly diesel vehicles (esp. ‘PM2.5’) are a major contributor to this crisis.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are well suited for modern Smart City environments; they produce zero emissions at point of use and less noise pollution compared with gasoline-powered vehicles. However, the growth of charging infrastructure has not kept momentum with vehicle development, limiting the widespread uptake of EVs. The currently available unreliable, slowcharging infrastructure is ineffective, making longer journeys uncertain, causing ‘range anxiety’. Slow chargers take 9 hours or more to charge a car, but upgrading slow chargers to rapid charging posts (involving inflexible sub-station upgrades and associated disruption over a long period) is impractical and costly for local authorities. Existing EV owners consistently report a desire for more extensive – and rapid – public charging infrastructure.

ZAPINAMO is an easily deployable, stored energy based EV rapid charging system; just like a power bank for a mobile phone, but bigger and faster. ZAPINAMO can harvest from various sources, preferably renewables and potentially off-grid supplies. ZAPINAMO utilises highly sophisticated and extremely reliable battery technology together with innovative ZAPINAMO power electronics to provide energy at a point where and when the EV user wants it—even totally off-grid—at the fastest rate / highest power the EV can handle. By advancing sustainability, affordability and security of supply along with economic growth, ZAPINAMO addresses key challenges in the EC Transport White Paper.",True
"Title: CRYTOCOP - Coat assembly and membrane remodelling: understanding regulation of protein secretion Abstract: Eukaryotic cells are organised in membrane-bound compartments, which have defined chemical identities and carry out specific essential functions. Exchange of material between these compartments is necessary to maintain cell functionality, and is achieved in a highly specific and regulated manner by vesicular transport. To mediate protein trafficking, coat complexes assemble on membranes and couple bilayer deformation with cargo capture into transport carriers. How coat assembly can deliver the flexibility necessary to accommodate a wide variety of cargo proteins, and how the process can be regulated, are outstanding questions in the field. This is exemplified by the COPII coat, which mediates export from the ER of about a third of newly synthesized proteins. COPII assembles into two concentric layers and can form transport carriers of a variety of shapes and sizes, including tubules and spherical vesicles. This is important for export of large cargoes and is a process targeted by cargo-specific regulatory factors. The aim of this project proposal is to shed light on the molecular interactions between coat components, and understand their role in determination of coat architecture and membrane shape. We will use a combination of structural and functional approaches to characterise COPII coat assembly, and its relationship with membranes in systems of increasing complexity, ranging from in vitro reconstitutions to cells. In particular, we will use cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to understand the architecture of the coat layers in these systems. These are fast-developing techniques that uniquely target complex structures while achieving high resolutions. With my lab at the forefront of current advances, we are perfectly placed to obtain a complete view of the COPII coat assembled on membranes. Our research will answer outstanding questions in the membrane trafficking field and open new perspectives to tackle ill-characterised regulation systems.",False
"Title: BE-OI - Beyond EPICA - Oldest Ice Abstract: To better constrain the response of Earth’s climate system to continuing emissions, it is essential to turn to the past. A key advance would be to understand the transition in Earth’s climate response to changes in orbital forcing during the 'mid-Pleistocene transition' (900 to 1200 thousand years ago) and in particular the role of greenhouse gases. Unravelling such key linkages between the carbon cycle, ice sheets, atmosphere and ocean behaviour is vital for society to better design effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Only ice cores contain the unique and quantitative information about past climate forcing and atmospheric responses. But the ice providing essential evidence about past mechanisms of climate change more than 1 Ma ago required for our understanding of these changes (termed the “Oldest Ice” core), has not been found to date.
The consortium BEYOND EPICA – OLDEST ICE (BE-OI), formed by 14 European institutions, takes on this challenge to prepare the ground for obtaining 1.5 million year old ice from East Antarctica. BE-OI has the objectives to:
- support the site selection through creation and synthesis of all necessary information on Antarctic sites through specific geophysical surveys and the use of fast drilling tools to qualify sites and validate the age of their ice;
- select and evaluate the optimum drill site for the future “Oldest Ice” core project and establish a science and management plan for a future drilling;
- coordinate the technical and scientific planning to ensure the availability of the technical means to implement suitable drill systems and analytical methodologies for a future ice-core drilling, and of well-trained personnel to operate them successfully;
- establish the budget and the financial background for a future deep-drilling campaign;
- embed the scientific aims of an “Oldest Ice” core project within the wider paleoclimate data and modelling communities through international and cross-disciplinary cooperation.",True
"Title: OCTAVE - Objective Control for TAlker VErification Abstract: Industry needs alternatives to textual passwords for access control. While tokens can still be stolen or transferred to other persons, biometrics technology can provide reliable, cost-effective and user-friendly solutions.
The proliferation of smart services calls for unsupervised authentication at a distance. Being natural, non-intrusive and readily compatible with smart and mobile devices, automatic speaker verification (ASV) is an appealing solution. Even so, today’s state-of-the-art ASV systems lack robustness to environmental variability and are vulnerable to spoofing. Concerns regarding interoperability, scalability and privacy also form barriers to exploitation.
While embracing standards, in addition to a privacy and interoperability-by-design ethos, OCTAVE will integrate commercial-grade and new, hybrid ASV systems with the latest environmental robustness and anti-spoofing technologies to deliver a scalable, trusted biometric authentication service (TBAS). While simultaneously relieving end-users from the inconvenience of dealing with textual passwords, the OCTAVE platform will reduce the economic and practical burdens related to password loss and recovery. The TBAS will support single (text-dependent, text-prompted and text-independent) in addition to hybrid operating modes. The delegation of authentication to a single, yet distributed TBAS, will increase trust and privacy, avoid single points of failure and allow for rapid breach notification and remediation.
Solutions will be installed in data-sensitive and mission-critical services and validated in two real commercial trials: banking services and physical access within a critical airport infrastructure. Flexibility will support wider exploitation in future applications in, for example, customer care, telephone banking, e-commerce, logical and physical access control. OCTAVE will thus fuel new opportunities for commercial services making use of electronic identification and authentication.",True

"Title: SPOTLIGHT - Single Point Of aTtachment communications empowered by cLoud computing and bIG data analytics running on-top of massively distributed and loosely-coupled Heterogeneous mobile data neTworks Abstract: To handle the unprecedented demand for mobile data traffic, different vendors, operators and research programmes have aimed to develop radio access technologies (RATs) that boost physical-layer link capacity, utilize millimeter wave radio, or further densify network topology. Notable steps have also been made towards shifting baseband processing from the (currently) ultra dense network edge to a central location where coordinated resource management will be performed. Nonetheless, the today’s mobile network ecosystem includes vastly heterogeneous, evidently overlapping (in coverage) and fully isolated (in operation) attachment points that still handle most of the functions necessary for mobile data communications independently. Aiming to meet and surpass the requirements set for the 5G-and-Beyond mobile data network, in SPOTLIGHT we will create a fully-integrated and multi-disciplinary network of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) that will analyze, design, and optimize the performance of a disruptive new mobile network architecture: the SPOTLIGHT architecture. This architecture promises to break performance limitations present to the currently loosely inter-connected, resource-fragmented and isolated in operation mobile network ecosystem, by transforming the currently loosely-coupled multitude of heterogeneous and multi-layered RATs to a flat coalition of massively distributed antenna sub-systems that are optimally orchestrated by a cloud-empowered network core. Our primary aim will be to support for the first time self-including yet ultra-reliable radio communications at the edge network. To further reduce response time and enhance network resilience, all functions necessary for mobile communications will be subject of i) massive parallelization in cloud platforms at the network core and ii) big data analysis running on-top of a virtual pool of shared energy, radio, computing and storage resources at the network.",True

"Title: ARISE2 - Atmospheric dynamics Research InfraStructure in Europe Abstract: It has been robustly demonstrated that variations in the circulation of the middle atmosphere influence weather and climate throughout the troposphere all the way to the Earth’s surface. A key part of the coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere occurs through the propagation and breaking of planetary-scale Rossby waves and gravity waves. Limited observation of the middle atmosphere and these waves in particular limits the ability to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of the middle atmosphere in numerical weather prediction and climate models. ARISE2 capitalizes upon the work of the EU-funded first ARISE project combining for the first time international networks with complementary technologies such as infrasound, lidar and airglow. This joint network provided advanced data products that started to be used as benchmarks for weather forecast models. The ARISE network also allows enhanced and detailed monitoring of other extreme events in the Earth system such as erupting volcanoes, magnetic storms, tornadoes and tropical thunderstorms. In order to improve the ability of the network to monitor atmospheric dynamics, ARISE2 proposes to extend i) the existing network coverage in Africa and the high latitudes, ii) the altitude range in the stratosphere and mesosphere, iii) the observation duration using routine observation modes, and to use complementary existing infrastructures and innovative instrumentations. Data will be collected over the long term to improve weather forecasting to monthly or seasonal timescales, to monitor atmospheric extreme events and climate change. Compared to the first ARISE project, ARISE2 focuses on the link between models and observations for future assimilation of data by operational weather forecasting models. Among the applications, ARISE2 proposes infrasound remote volcano monitoring to provide notifications to civil aviation.

"Title: MigrationRadar - Elucidating continental-scale patterns of bird migration with weather radars Abstract: Migration is a wide-spread phenomenon which allows animals of many different taxa to take advantage of seasonal variation in resource abundance. Radar is a powerful tool to observe and track migratory flights. In this action I will use the existing European network of weather radars to investigate bird migration behaviour and patterns at the continental-scale in relation to topography, weather and insect migration. A unique aspect of this action is that I will have access not only to bird migration data from weather radars, but also to complementary data from small-scale dedicated biological radars (units specifically designed to monitor bird and insect migration), as well as bird ringing and monitoring data from several key locations (migration hotspots). Weather radars will provide data on bird migration patterns at the continental-scale (along the “Western European Flyway”); the small-scale biological radars will provide more detailed information on insect and bird migration patterns at specific sites; and the ringing and monitoring data will provide species composition at specific points along the flyway. Together this will give us a unique overview of the flux and behaviour of migratory animals across Europe, something that has never before been possible.

The objectives of the work packages in this action will be:

WP 1:  To describe the flux of bird migration in relation to weather and topography across the western fly-way in Europe, and relate this to insect migration at specific sites and monitoring data along the fly-way. 

WP 2: To investigate flight behaviour of bird and insect migrants in relation to winds at both a continental and local scale, testing theoretical predictions of how migrants should use winds optimally.

"Title: XYMOF - Artificial Intelligence meets Material Genome: intelligent design of new MOFs for xylene separation challenge. Abstract: Chemical separation technologies consume 15% of the global energy. Separation of xylene, a common chemical produced on an enormous scale, is one of the most difficult cases, due to very similar physical properties of xylene isomers. This project will address this challenge by identifying an adsorptive material with superior selectivity towards the desired isomer, compared to the current state-of-the-art adsorbents. A very selective material, used as a membrane or in the adsorption unit, would make a step-change in the xylene separation technologies and lead to significant energy savings. To achieve this overall objective, I put together a novel computational strategy by combining molecular simulations, data analysis and AI methods. Using this strategy, I will mine tens and hundreds of thousands of real and hypothetical materials that already exist within the Material Genome, a global space of possible materials and their features. The focus of the project will be on Metal-Organic frameworks (MOFs) since they already show a particular promise for difficult separations. Specific scientific objectives of the project aim to i) understand what MOFs are promising for xylene separations ii) what structural features of MOFs are responsible for their specific behaviour iii) and then, using the AI models, design MOFs with superior xylene separation performance. 
The progress will be enabled by i) an outstanding research environment of the host group, Prof. Sarkisov, and the infrastructure of the University of Manchester; ii) interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaborations with the leading academics and companies (Prof. Goodwin, University of Oxford, Dr. Pullumbi, Air Liquide); iii) excellent training and professional development opportunities.

"Title: MsgRNA - Modification of single guide (sg) RNA in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing Tool Abstract: CRISPR/Cas9 has been extensively studied for genome editing, but its therapeutic application has been hampered by off-target effects. Site-specific modification of single guide (sg) RNA in CRISPR system is a potential means to expand the utility of CRISPR-Cas genome editing. To address this, and reduce of synthetic burden of sgRNA we propose a ‘click’ ligation method to synthesize sgRNA where two chemically modified oligonucleotides are joined together using CuAAC chemistry. The resultant artificial linkage is biomimetic, so it should not affect Cas9 activity. This method offers significantly higher DNA-targeting specificity (i.e. less off-target effects) and most importantly provides a cost-effective means to access thousands of synthetic sgRNAs. Imaging in CRISPR-Cas9 system using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes have enabled significant advancements in understanding genomic structure and transcriptional control. We will explore novel approaches to image CRISPR-Cas9 system using fluorophore-quencher pairs. The activation of fluorescence can be performed upon nuclear localisation using RNase H, and upon sgRNA binding to the target DNA. These methods will provide highly fluorescent sgRNAs for live-cell imaging, potentially much brighter compared to other methods. To control CRISPR off-target effects we will also design a light induced DNA damage method where cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside or psolaren will be incorporated in the DNA-targeting RNA. Therefore, modification of sgRNA for CRISPR system can be used to address the biological limitations of CRISPR and expand its functionality. This will open up many avenues for future development and lead to more application-focused studies on therapeutic gene editing.",False
"Title: JUSTNORTH - Toward Just, Ethical and Sustainable Arctic Economies, Environments and Societies Abstract: Arctic development of the past is persistent in inequitable practices, leaving scars from the impacts of social, economic and environmental inequality. In addition, Arctic development of today is occurring alongside the adverse effects of climate change within an integrated global system deficient in mechanisms for incentivising just transitions toward sustainable development.   With the goal of enhancing the governance capacity of the EU to mitigate this problem, JUSTNORTH brings together 15 partners from 7 disciplines to evaluate the viability of Arctic economic activities. The project will merge justice theories with sustainable development goals to enable EU policy coherence toward just transitions. This will be integrated with an investigation of the empirical realities of existing Arctic economic activities in 18 case studies using innovative research methodology, through conceptual, comparative, descriptive, correlation, policy, legal and interview-based analysis techniques. Though this, JUSTNORTH will offer policy, legal and regulatory pathway recommendations, by developing a frameworks from the reconciliation of the various ethics and value systems present in the Arctic, which can serve as a cornerstone for determining the viability of economic activities in the Arctic in line with the goals of sustainable development.  Ultimately, JUSTNORTH will provide both a negotiation tool for stakeholders to Arctic development (and a potential labelling standard for just/ethical regulatory standards) in its JUSTscore framework, which will create both transparency, documentation and standardisation for sustainable development across the Arctic (and the EU market).   Adhering to coproduction of knowledge with stakeholders throughout, JUSTNORTH will bring insights from indigenous, local, business, State and NGO perspectives of the social, economic and environmental complexities of the Arctic into the realm of policymaking for just sustainable development.",False
"Title: INTERACTIVE - Social selection and social plasticity in virtual ecosystems Abstract: INTERACTIVE is a multidisciplinary project that aims to understand how and when social interactions maintain behavioural diversity. We test predictions rooted in ecological and evolutionary theory to  investigate i) how behaviours of social partners affect individual fitness (social selection), ii) how individuals adjust their behaviours in response to others (social plasticity) and whether plasticity is under selection, iii) how experience affects individual decisions. To answer our questions, we use ‘big data’ on human behaviour derived from a novel source, virtual ecosystems of cooperative multiplayer videogames. Our study system is the online multiplayer videogame ‘Dead by daylight’, where players repeatedly interact and cooperate to achieve a common goal. The project applies state-of-the-art theoretical and analytical tools from quantitative genetics and behavioural ecology to an exceptionally large, detailed, and complete dataset mapping behaviours of millions of players across millions of social interactions over years of gameplay. This unique dataset provides us an unprecedented opportunity to test, refine, and increase the predictive power of ecology and evolutionary theoretical models by overcoming empirical constrains common in research on nonhuman animals. INTERACTIVE combines the host’s expertise in quantitative genetics, selection analysis, and social evolution, with my strong background in behavioural and evolutionary ecology. I will develop analytical skills in high demand in the academic market, build a cross-disciplinary profile and strong ties with the industry, enhancing my competitiveness.

"Title: VoidTrap - Advanced studies of trapping and rotation of nanoparticles in vacuum Abstract: The aim of this proposal is to explore new and innovative routes to confine and cool trapped microparticles in vacuum. The elegance of trapping such microparticles in vacuum arises from the absence of any physical contact with the environment leading to any routes of dissipation. The challenge is to hold such particles in strong, highly localised traps, cool them and explore physics at the classical-quantum boundary.
The present proposal aims to address these issues with a number of clear routes to address acknowledged bottlenecks in the field. (i) Firstly the use of light propagation in complex media (such as a multimode fibre) combined with vacuum studies leads to an innovative route for trapping, confining and addressing microparticles in complex vacuum systems without the need for ‘bulk’ microscope objectives or conventional optics. This also facilitates trapping in such geometries and creating with ease loading and 'science' chambers for the proposed research. (ii) A further advance will be the use of nanostructures such as double nanohole arrays for trapping that, due to their strong light confinement lead to ultra-high trap stiffnesses. In turn this means the very high resultant oscillator frequency reduces the cooling needed to achieve the quantum ground state. (iii) Finally a third strand will look at loading antireflection coated particles into such traps. This can result in trap stiffnesses up to one to two orders of magnitude higher than currently seen, again allowing cooling to the ground state.
These ideas are disruptive and unconventional and unique to the applicant and host institute to the best of our knowledge. They will result in a step change in the field and internationally leading results. In addition the programme will allow a comprehensive and positive training package for the applicant as a basis for his future career in academia.",False

"Title: HQSTS - High-Quality voice model for STatistical parametric speech Synthesis Abstract: A speech analysis/synthesis method aims at representing a speech waveform, produced by a person speaking, as a time sequence of parameters. Based on this time sequence, the speech waveform can be resynthesized. The analysis/synthesis methods are cornerstones for many speech technologies (e.g. text-to-speech, telecommunications, voice restoration). For the majority of applications, these methods need to have two key properties: (i) a high perceived quality of the speech sound, and, (ii) a statistical characterization of the parameters' sequence necessary for statistical approaches, which have attracted great interest during the last decades in speech technologies. The current analysis/synthesis methods that provide a statistical characterization exhibit however a lack of perceived quality. This issue does not pose a problem in applications designed for noisy environments (e.g. navigation devices, smart-phone applications, announcements in train stations). On the contrary, it prohibits the use of statistical approaches in quiet environments, e.g. in the music, cinema and video game industries, where the listener is fully aware of all the details of the sound. This problem is mainly due to the lack of an accurate representation of the phase information and its correlation with the amplitude information. Indeed, recent phase processing tools allowed the description of the phase spectrum properties in a way that shows the drawbacks and limits of current analysis/synthesis methods. Additionally, these same tools are also promising means for modeling the phase information, which is paramount for good quality. The primary goal of the HQSTS project is to create a high-quality analysis/synthesis method that will broaden the applications of statistical approaches of speech technologies in quiet environments, where a high-quality is an absolute necessity.",True
"Title: RF Beamformer - Ultra-low-cost terminals that meet the special requirements of all satellite operators allowing them to access markets currently inaccessible due to terminal economics. Abstract: Broadband has become an essential part of 21st-century infrastructure. New cloud services are making it a necessity for starting and growing small businesses, as well as advancing a wide variety of industries. However, more than half of the world's population still does not have access to internet being at a disadvantage; and the digital gap will continue to grow wider. Traditional wireless networks are expensive to install or expand and consequently low subscriber areas and less lucrative developing regions will likely never see cellular access. As an alternative, satellite access offers more than 5,000 times the spectrum compared to terrestrial networks -plus it is global and cover land, sea and air. Nevertheless, this technology is held back by current ground-based terminal (antenna) solutions that are expensive, single beam, require high power and have limited scalability.

Isotropic’s Radio Frequency (RF) Beamformer technology is a highly innovative system that exploits the science of transformational optics to provide the self-aligning ability of large phased array antennas but with significantly reduced complexity. This allows for drastically reduced cost and power consumption whilst increasing operational flexibility and performance. RF Beamformer is an ultra-low cost antenna technology that enables an optimised ground-based terminal that is otherwise currently missing in the industry development roadmap.

To date we have received $6M in venture capital and following successful results from founder´s research, the technology has reached TRL 5. We are now looking for funds to following our detailed product roadmap, translate our technology to products and bring satellite connectivity to the mass market by 2021.

The proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME Instrument fits into our overall plan to reach the market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a fast sound wider deployment of RF Beamformer and its market uptake.",True
"Title: PhilAnd - The origin and early development of philosophy in tenth-century al-Andalus: the impact of ill-defined materials and channels of transmission. Abstract: The objective of PhilAnd is to conduct a large-scale exploration of how, and under which form, philosophy appeared for the first time in al-Andalus. This issue is pivotal to understanding the history of sciences and ideas, and the role of the Arab-Muslim world in this transfer to Medieval Europe. Its relevance today also lies in the fact that it addresses questions of cultural and religious identities, since the formative stage of philosophy in al-Andalus proved decisive in shaping the intellectual background of many later authors from the Peninsula, whether Muslims, Jews, or Christians. At the crossroads of major lines of enquiries in scholarship and in line with recent discoveries having important chronological implications, PhilAnd focuses on the 10th century, a period usually disregarded by historians on the assumption that philosophy as such was not cultivated in the Iberian Peninsula before the 11th-12th centuries. Its originality is also to put emphasis on ‘ill-defined’ materials and channels of transmission, a field which remains largely unexplored. This project consists of five topics designed for highly-specialised scholars, and of another three transversal types of exploration conducted in the form of conferences convened with leading experts in the world. The final objectives are to test the hypothesis: 1) that the emergence of philosophy in al-Andalus significantly predates the currently accepted time; and 2) that the impact of this formative stage was considerably wider than commonly acknowledged. This project also seeks to provide a better evaluation of the originality of the first Andalusī philosophers with respect to their Oriental forerunners. This cutting-edge investigation is likely to stimulate major changes in our perception of how this primeval stage of philosophy in al-Andalus determined the subsequent developments of rational speculation among the three monotheistic communities of the Peninsula and the intellectual formation of Europe.",False
"Title: FleXelL - Reversible solid oxide cell development for the utilisation of alternative fuels and hydrogen strategic production Abstract: The flexible cell project (FleXelL) aims at developing a proof of concept for a highly efficient energy converter based on ceramic reactors that can be reversed into an electrolyser whenever needed. We will be developing a device capable of converting liquid and gaseous fuels such as ethanol, methane or natural gas into energy, but also, steam and electricity into hydrogen for strategic reserve purposes or simply for renewable energy surplus storage.
For this purpose, we here propose a knowledge transfer scheme between Dr Sarruf and the Centre for Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Research (CFCHR) at the University of Birmingham (UoB), herein represented by Prof Robert Steinberger-Wilckens. We build on UoB’s ceramic processing techniques, materials characterisation capacity, project management capabilities, teaching expertise, communications and leadership skills, and Dr Sarruf’s knowledge in materials development for fuel flexibility conversion within solid oxide cells (SOCs).
Dr Sarruf, under Prof. Steinberger-Wilckens’ supervision, will develop and optimise an anode-supported reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) capable of operating directly with primary fuels, as aforementioned, and electrolysing water to produce hydrogen. The reproducibility of the cells’ manufacturing process as well as the performance will be developed aiming at rousing industrial interest via the development of a product’s business plan.",False
"Title: OPN-Can - Investigating the role of OPN-CD44 in mechanosensitive tumour invasion using biomimetic models Abstract: New fields are rapidly emerging that provide exciting and unforeseen opportunities to target disease. This is especially relevant for difficult-to-treat tumours where, despite decades of promising research, successful clinical translation of therapeutic options remains intractable. The interrelated fields of mechanobiology and biomimetic engineered disease models have come to the fore in the last decade1–3 and provide a range of opportunities to investigate therapeutic modalities4. These fields have implications for cancer research in three major aspects: 1) dissection of the cell biology governing microenvironmental sensing; 2) development of biomimetic platforms that enhance both the relevance (accuracy) of experimental models and our understanding of tumour biology, especially at the level of microenvironment and cell signalling; and 3) creation of analysis tools to quantify cell sensing. In this MSCA Global Fellowship, I propose a formative advanced research training period at one of the world’s leading institutions of cell and molecular biology and bioengineering (UCB) to learn and apply state-of-the-art biomimetic platforms for a novel tumour biology research project investigating osteopontin(OPN)-CD44 in mechanosensitive glioblastoma invasion. This interdisciplinary collaboration will match the expertise of UCB in biomimetic tumour invasion modelling of the biomechanical and biochemical properties of glioblastoma with my expertise in matricellular biology developed through my prior postdoctoral studies of osteopontin in liver disease. On my return to Europe at KCL, this will provide a springboard to establish an innovative independent research program in promising and underinvestigated tumour biology. I will transfer the knowledge learned at UCB to establish to investigate hepatocellular carcinoma invasion with biomimetic models. This work will ultimately benefit the development of anti-invasive adjuvant therapies.",False
"Title: DigiScore - Digital Scores – investigating the technological transformation of the music score Abstract: Digital scores utilising computational technology and digital media are emerging worldwide as the next evolutionary stage in the concept of the music score (Vear 2019). Yet there has been no scientific study of digital scores; nor their effect upon creativity and musicianship. This is remarkable for two reasons:  First, because digital scores are generating new music experiences, innovative compositional approaches, novel performance opportunities, and broader accessibility for a vast number of musicians and music cultures around the world.  Second, because many topics immediately adjacent or informing digital scores have been theorised thereby liberating these subjects and innovating creative practices, e.g. digital media art, digital performance, electro-acoustic music.  This project will launch the first scientific investigation into the transformation of the music score through computational technologies.  The core aims of the project are to:          (1) determine scientific knowledge of how digital scores stimulate new creative opportunities and experiences within a range of music practices,          (2) develop a theoretical framework for digital scores as an important transdisciplinary area of research,           (3) build a scientific study of inclusive digital musicianship through the transformative potential of the digital score.  This project will investigate these questions through an innovative combination of artistic and scientific research methods, undertaken by a transdisciplinary and international team of scientists and artists, led by a world expert of digital scores: Prof. Dr. Craig Vear. This is real “frontier research”, the benefits of which extend beyond music studies into computer science, new media research, digital humanities, performance studies and creative practice.",False
"Title: BIM2TWIN - BIM2TWIN: Optimal Construction Management & Production Control Abstract: BIM2TWIN aims to build a Digital Building Twin (DBT) platform for construction management that implements lean principles to reduce operational waste of all kinds, shortening schedules, reducing costs, enhancing quality and safety and reducing carbon footprint. BIM2TWIN proposes a comprehensive, holistic approach. It consists of a (DBT) platform that provides full situational awareness and an extensible set of construction management applications. It supports a closed loop Plan-Do-Check-Act mode of construction. Its key features are:
1> Grounded conceptual analysis of data, information and knowledge in the context of DBTs, which underpins a robust system architecture
2> A common platform for data acquisition and complex event processing to interpret multiple monitored data streams from construction site and supply chain to establish real-time project status in a Project Status Model (PSM)
3> Exposure of the PSM to a suite of construction management applications through an easily accessible application programming interface (API) and directly to users through a visual information dashboard
4> Applications include monitoring of schedule, quantities & budget, quality, safety, and environmental impact. 
5> PSM representation based on property graph semanticaly linked to the Building Information Model (BIM) and all project management data. The property graph enables flexible, scalable storage of raw monitoring data in different formats, as well as storage of interpreted information. It enables smooth transition from construction to operation.
BIM2TWIN is a broad, multidisciplinary consortium with hand-picked partners who together provide an optimal combination of knowledge, expertise and experience in a variety of monitoring technologies, artificial intelligence, computer vision, information schema and graph databases, construction management, equipment automation and occupational safety. The DBT platform will be experimented on 3 demo sites (SP, FR, FI).",False
"Title: URBAVENTO - An innovative, small footprint, vertical axis wind turbine for decentralized energy-production designed for urban areas, which is cheap to maintain and ensures energy production even at low wind speed Abstract: Customers using traditional horizontal axis wind turbines are facing several problems, such as: noise, unaesthetic appearance so they need to be installed in remote locations. As a result, the power is generated very far from where it is meant to be consumed, causing an energy loss of 20% during the transfer (line-losses); they also need strong winds to function and are expensive to install and maintain.
 Newenergy21 has designed and developed UrbaVento, an innovative vertical axis wind turbine for decentralized energy-production (smart grid applications as well as off-grid), which features carbon-fibre “wings”, as well as a smart control and fault diagnostic software that simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting and tracks performance and savings. 
The UrbaVento is a big leap forward compared to current wind turbines due to its unique advantages, which are firstly: its compatibility with the urban environment, since it features silent energy production at low wind speeds, starting from less than 3m/s, while it can produce up to 10 MWh of electricity per year when operating between 7 and 10m/s; it is suited for distributed power production because it can be installed anywhere due to its compact size and attractive appearance. Secondly, it offers a higher return on investment since it is cheaper to install, operate and maintain, due to its low number of moving parts, the absence of a gearbox and the location of all serviceable components are at ground level, enabling the turbine to seamlessly reach its envisaged life-cycle; Thirdly, its wings can be used as a reflective screen, making it an attractive medium for advertising.
The Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with 10 turbines installed in different locations, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.",False
"Title: COSMOVOID - Cosmology with voids and superclusters: combining theory, simulation and observation Abstract: The aim of this cosmology proposal is to study the contents, history and evolution of our Universe, using the distribution of matter on large scales. I propose to study new methods to identify and catalogue rare voids and superclusters in the large-scale structure of the Universe and to study their statistical, morphological and dynamical properties. I will use these studies to propose new observables and new techniques of data analysis based on these structures, and to use this knowledge to test theories of gravitation, dark energy and the initial conditions of the early Universe. Interest in cosmic voids in particular has increased greatly in recent years, as they have been suggested as extremely competitive probes of cosmology, according to some estimates significantly out-performing other methods. Yet there remain unsolved theoretical difficulties in the modelling of voids and even a lack of consensus on how to identify them and how to relate theory and observation. Even less is currently known about superclusters. These are among the important issues I propose to address. My proposal consists in roughly equal parts of: analysis of the latest high-quality survey data which will available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES); analysis of the state-of-the-art Jubilee ISW and weak lensing simulations run on the Juropa supercomputer in Germany; and theoretical work to combine insights from data and simulation to improve our understanding of cosmology. The proposed work is to be carried out in collaboration with leading experts in the respective fields from across the European Community, in particular in the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany.",False

"Title: ORIONAS - Lasercom-on-chip for next generation, high-speed satellite constelation interconnectivity Abstract: The satellite market experiences a paradigm shift with the rise of satellite constellations that are changing the satellite volume launched from now on. Under increasing capacity requirements, primes admit that lasercom is required to connect their constellations at high speeds not possible with RF equipment. This is shaping a unique opportunity for the penetration of optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) into a market that will only grow. The deal for OISLs is clear; low cost, size, weight and power consumption (C-SWAP), but the current tools and methods used to make OISL systems are fundamentally incompatible with this requirement and the jump to satellite lasercom is a jump to higher complexity. ORIONAS aims to provide the technology that will disrupt the way lasercom systems are designed, built and tested and hit the right C-SWAP targets. ORIONAS invests in monolithic integration within European BICMOS and InP foundries for cost-effective access to high performance technologies. Using its photonics BICMOS integration platform, ORIONAS will squeeze lasercom transceivers into a few mm^2 demonstrating modulator/driver electronic-photonic IC (ePIC) being >2 orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art space (SOTA) qualified modulators and receiver ePICs being 3 orders of magnitude smaller than conventional free space optics receivers used in current lasercom modems. ORIONAS will develop a Hi-rel packaging technology to deliver all-laser weldable, hermetic transceivers that will be 20 times faster and 16x times smaller than current SOTA lasercom systems and with power dissipation in the order of a few pJ/bit. Using InP integration ORIONAS will fabricate SOAs being 2 orders of magnitude smaller than current space qualified high power fiber amplifiers and >10x times more powerful than current commercial SOAs. ORIONAS will system integrate the ePIC and SOA modules into its lasercom mini-modem platform and will test it within the test facilities of the end user.",True
"Title: CHARISMA - Converged Heterogeneous Advanced 5G Cloud-RAN Architecture for Intelligent and Secure Media Access Abstract: CHARISMA proposes an intelligent hierarchical routing and paravirtualised architecture that unites two important concepts: devolved offload with shortest path nearest to end-users and an end-to-end security service chain via virtualized open access physical layer security (PLS). The CHARISMA architecture meets the goals of low-latency (<1ms) and security required for future converged wireless/wireline advanced 5G networking. This provides a cloud infrastructure platform with increased spectral and energy efficiency and enhanced performance targeting the identified needs for 1000-fold increased mobile data volume, 10-100 times higher data rates, 10-100 times more connected devices and 5x reduced latency. 

Fully aligned and committed to the 5G-PPP principles and KPIs, the CHARISMA proposal brings together 10G-wireless (via mm-wave/60-GHz & free-space optics, FSO) access and 100G fixed optical (OFDM-PON) solutions through an intelligent cloud radio-access-network (C-RAN) and intelligent radio remote head (RRH) platform with IPv6 Trust Node routing featuring very low-latency for the traffic management. Low-cost Ethernet is used across front- and backhaul, and end-user equipment (vCPE), and intelligence distributed across the back-, front-hauls, and perimetric data transports. Ad-hoc mobile device interconnectivities (D2D, D2I, C2C etc.), content delivery network (CDN) and mobile distributed caching (MDC) offer an energy-efficient (better than x20 improvement possible) information-centric networking (ICN) architecture. Furthermore, caching will provide efficient utilization of scarce resources by early aggregating data or/and by executing communication locally.

- Fuel the creative industries’ growing demand for high-quality content by developing a user-centric, mobile-based, 3D-acquisition tool to transform the real-world into new forms of creative-assets by recruiting and encouraging the involvement of everyone.

- Establish rich and flexible forms of reusable content through the development of semantic decomposition tools that can guide users through the process of unlocking sub-elements of objects and easily add lifelike properties to complex objects.

- Introduce and stimulate the creative industries to new ways of content creation, access and reusability through a carefully devised crowd-sourcing strategy, fuelled by 3 Creativity Incubators.

Enhance the human creative process through the integration of novel Mixed-Reality (MR) user experiences, enabling experimental solutions like 3D/4D storyboarding in unconstrained environments and the ad-hoc expression of ideas by disassembling and reassembling objects in a co-creative workspace.

REPLICATE will benefit many stakeholder groups: Citizens will be empowered to generate 3D and be encouraged to solve disambiguations during reconstruction and  decomposition. Creative people without prior 3D expertise will get icon-driven tools to experiment and play with 3D. Creativity professionals will be able to add richness and semantic-awareness to 3D models by harnessing human experience and state-of-the-art object detection.

"Title: HawkEye - Vision-based Guidance and Control in Birds, with Applications to Autonomous Unmanned Aircraft Abstract: Birds have been called “une aile guidée par un oeil”, and whilst they possess many senses besides vision, their wings are indeed guided largely by their eyes. Nevertheless, we know surprisingly little of how birds use vision to guide their flight, and almost nothing of the underlying guidance and control laws. This is an extraordinary omission, and unfortunate given the importance that vision is poised to assume in autonomous unmanned aircraft. With good reason, the law still requires a human eye to remain in the loop, but as with the coming revolution in driverless cars, the future of flight lies in autonomy. I see a once-in-a-career opportunity here: we need only imagine a hawk, shooting over the top of a hedgerow then plunging through the undergrowth onto its fleeting prey, to see what engineering could learn. Building upon the success of my ERC Starting Grant on Bird and Insect Flight Dynamics and Control, my proposed Consolidator Grant has two overarching ambitions: 1) to revolutionize our understanding of vision-based guidance and control in birds; and 2) to carry these insights over to application in unmanned autonomous aircraft. This presents a formidable technical challenge, but by combining a state-of-the-art motion capture suite with targets/obstacles moving under motion control in a custom-built facility, I will use system identification techniques to unambiguously identify the guidance and control laws underpinning perching, pursuit, obstacle avoidance, and gap negotiation in birds. More than this, I will identify the precise motion cues to which they attend, settling longstanding questions on the extent to which guidance emerges from simple algorithmic rules versus state feedback and estimation, with wider implications for our understanding of avian perception. This work will break new ground in all directions, testing applied insights in the same facility, and so leading the world in drawing the study of birds and aircraft together under one roof.",False
"Title: AiRT - Technology transfer of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) for the creative industry Abstract: Aerial photography and filming represent an indispensable resource for the Creative Industries (CIs). When filming in indoor environments, auxiliary devices as cable cams, camera rails, jibs, scaffolds or lifting platforms are being employed, enabling to realize special aerial camera shots.  With the rise of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), commonly known as drones, CIs are increasingly focusing on its use outdoors, providing significant advantages over current photography and filming techniques such as widening the creative possibilities and freedom of camera movement, less invasive and risky compared to auxiliary devices and affordable.

However, RPAS cannot be professionally employed indoors by the CIs. Existing RPAS lack of a precise, robust and affordable indoor positioning system (IPS) as well as advanced safety features. Without a good IPS the control of the RPAS in indoor environments is particularly difficult and even unsafe. Currently, there are three IPS suitable for RPAS, but these are too expensive (€200k), or present large limitations (e.g. sensitive to light conditions) for its usage by CI SMEs. This jeopardizes the creative possibilities of CI and their competitiveness.

Hence, the main goal of AiRT project is to provide the European CI SMEs a tool that, by expanding their creative spaces will help them to offer new services, which in turn will increase their changes to grow within the European and international market. To accomplish this objective, AiRT project will develop the world´s first indoor RPAS specifically designed for professional use by the CIs.

As a result, over 900.000 European CI firms will benefit from the transfer of the latest advances in IPS, 3D scene reconstruction, navigation and active / passive safety measures into an intelligent indoor RPAS, being able to avoid both static and dynamic objects. In addition AiRT system could be programmed in order to fly autonomously, enabling the CIs to focus on the camera control.",True
"Title: SAFE-10-T - Safety of Transport Infrastructure on the TEN-T Network Abstract: The SAFE-10-T project will develop a Safety Framework to ensure high safety performance while allowing longer life-cycles for critical infrastructure across the road, rail and inland waterway modes. Moving from considering critical infrastructure such as bridges, tunnels and earthworks as inert objects to being intelligent (self-learning objects) the SAFE-10-T project will provide a means of virtually eradicating sudden failures. This will be achieved by:

•	The Safety framework will incorporate remote monitoring data stored in a BIM model that feeds into a decision support framework (DST) that enables decisions to be made automatically with maintenance prioritised for elements exhibiting stress.
•	A major advance that will be achieved in the project is that the algorithms at an object level and at a network level will incorporate machine learning to train the system to evolve with time using available monitoring data. 
•	A trans-disciplinary approach with experts in Artificial Intelligence and big data management working with owners, engineers with expertise in risk and modelling and sociologists  to make decisions.
•	Our major European infrastructure managers (Rijkswaterstaat for roads and inland waterways and Network Rail) will undertake demonstration projects at critical interchanges and nodes of the TEN-T transport network.

The project will achieve significant impact in asset management by:

(i)	By moving to intelligent objects that communicate their safety condition during extreme events we will provide a means of virtually eradicating sudden catastrophic failure of infrastructure objects.
(ii)	The project will use Open Linked Data formats to manage all data and inputs from other sources. Mitigation actions can be taken and warnings of the increased risk level can be transmitted to other agencies and the public.

"Title: PDE-GIR - PDE-based geometric modelling, image processing, and shape reconstruction Abstract: Geometric modelling, image processing, and shape reconstruction have huge applications in various sectors and greatly impact on EU’s economy, human health, security, entertainment and others. Existing problems such as big data and heavy manual operations in geometric modelling, incapacity in image processing in continuous domains, and lack of continuity and differentiability in shape reconstruction seriously affect quality, efficiency and capacity. Partial differential equation (PDE) based techniques provide effective solutions to these problems. Current PDE-based modelling cannot achieve both powerful capacity and high computational performance. PDE-based image processing suffers from expensive cost and local minimization. PDE-based shape reconstruction has not been developed.

PDE-GIR will tackle above mentioned problems by developing advanced PDE based techniques, exploiting their applications through exchanges of research and innovation staff, international and intersectoral collaborations, and knowledge transfer. It consists of four work packages. “PaMod” will develop new PDE-based modelling techniques to obtain powerful capacity and high computational performance. “VaMod” will develop new variational models to improve efficiency and quality. “ShaRecons” will combine new PDE-based modelling with variational models to solve the problems of continuity, differentiability, and big data. “M&D” is designed to efficiently manage the project, disseminate research output, and promote the applications of the developed techniques.

The consortium consists of leading experts who have been working at the forefront of geometric modelling, image processing and shape reconstruction for many years. PDE-GIR will combine their strengths to achieve the success of the proposed research. The developed techniques will be applied in academic and non-academic sectors, and integrated into IDF’s services and products to promote technology innovation and realize their commercial value.",False
"Title: GIRLPOS - A Genealogy of Islamic Religious Leadership in Post-Ottoman States Abstract: A Genealogy of Islamic Religious Leadership in Post-Ottoman States (GIRLPOS)

This project will produce the first history of the 'Grand Mufti' as a modern model of Islamic religious leadership. This title emerged in several Arab states in the process of post-Ottoman nation-building, and represents a common trend toward the articulation of ‘religion’ as a social category distinct from the implicitly ‘non-religious’. Ottoman muftis had been legal scholars serving the courts and society at large, and muftis have been studied ever since through a classical lens of scholarly knowledge production. Yet the creation of new offices of ‘Grand Mufti’ in successor states has radically reformulated their function. For the first time in Islamic history, Middle Eastern states have generated centralised religious hierarchies in which a Grand Mufti administers a professionalised ‘clergy’ and a nationwide network of mosques, schools, cemeteries and other properties defined as religious. My contribution will be a genealogy of this contemporary model of Islamic religious leadership, using it as a lens through which to analyse changing discourses around ‘religion’ in modern Islam.",False
"Title: ROBOTGRAFT - An integrated high throughput robot and a new multi-rootstock grafting technology to improve plant/crop yield Abstract: FuturaGraft is an SME from Israel. It has developed a high performing automated robot system to replace the existing time-consuming, laborious method of grafting plants. Plant grafting is the combination of a stronger root with a desired plant seedling and is used to improve the quality and performance of vegetables, flowers and herbs. 
Grafting is the most diffused practice employed to achieve more durable, more resistant and productive plants. Current practice is often by manual grafting and is labour intensive and inefficient; robotics have been introduced but offer limited improvements. An alternative plant modification method is needed to cultivate stronger plants without using pesticides or genetically modifying the structure. FuturaGraft’s robot is fully automated and can graft a tray of plants whilst simultaneously undertaking trimming, clearing and disinfecting. The robot improves nursery operations by increasing capacity and shortening growth time; enables early stage grafting providing a faster recovery; increases the yield and produces better quality grafts. Plants grafted by FuturaGraft can grow and survive in lower quality soils as the rootstock used in the grafting strengthens the plant and is resistant to a range of soil-borne diseases.
Within the overall project, FuturaGraft aims to: engineer the automatic grafting machine to graft a full tray simultaneously and reach a capacity of no less than 5000 plants an hour; automate grafting methods to a level that will increase productivity and reduce water and fertilizer usage; to expand the robot’s capability to graft combinations of three plants; and demonstrate and validate the robot grafting process with the involvement of at least one end-user in the field of tomato plants production.",False
"Title: PRECIOUS - Scaling-up biodegradable nanomedicines for multimodal for multimodal precision cancer immunotherapy Abstract: PRECIOUS aims at scaling-up biodegradable nanomedicines for multimodal precision cancer immunotherapy.
With 3.5 million cancer patients in Europe every year, new cancer medicines are eagerly awaited, notably for prostate and ovarian cancer.
Systemically applied new immunotherapies are promising, but their toxicity is a hurdle. Vaccination against cancer is safe but rather the efficacy can be disappointing, i.e. the microenvironment shuts down anti-tumour immunity.

PRECIOUS will tackle 2 bottlenecks:
1.	Production of non toxic multimodal nanomedicines, which induce vigorous immune responses, and at the same time reverse immunosuppression
2.	Large scale GMP production of nanomedicines, and initiate a multimodal immunotherapy Phase I trial. 

We want to solve these bottlenecks by:
Objective 1: Two types of GMP biodegradable nanoparticles: 1) a nanovaccine, containing tumour antigens and immune activators, and 2) a nanoparticle composed of compounds, which reverses the suppression and reactivates immunity in the tumour.
Objective 2: Clinical Phase I trial to show efficacy. Nanomedicines will be used by 1) injection of vaccines to evoke immune responses and 2) injection of nanoparticles in the tumour microenvironment, which slowly release compounds that reverse suppression.

To achieve this, a platform is formed with 6 leading industrial partners to produce large scale GMP nanomedicines and an excellent immunomodulator track record, together with 5 renowned academic partners to perform clinical studies.

Collectively, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) includes systems such as the US Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLONASS, as well as the new, under development systems like China’s Beidou and most importantly Europe’s Galileo. Galileo is what we call the European GNSS (EGNSS) and is to be fully operational around 2020, therefore the pressing need to invest on research and training right now. This is especially so because GPS has clearly been the frontrunner of all these systems and has dominated the market for two decades now. EGNSS (Galileo) is aimed at changing this market unbalance and is the main focus of this proposal, which concentrates on its use in support of applications demanding high accuracy positioning and navigation.  TREASURE’s cohort of 13 young researchers will be given gap-bridging innovative training through an exceptional and unique network of industrial, research and academic beneficiaries, with the aim to form a group of outstanding researchers who would not be able to acquire the equivalent set of skills by training at any individual European institution alone. World-class expertise on EGNSS exists in Europe, however multi-disciplinary research skills need expanding to maximise the enormous potential that there is for promotion and exploitation of this technology. TREASURE addresses that need and responds to the much desired involvement of end-users and businesses, by bringing together four top Universities, one research Institute and four leading European companies, with extensive track record and experience in a wide breadth of disciplines to provide the necessary coordinated research training that will enable the ultimate real time high accuracy EGNSS solution.",True
"Title: CUPIDO - Cardio Ultraefficient nanoParticles for Inhalation of Drug prOducts Abstract: The incidence of Cardiovascular Disease (CD) claims worldwide 17.1 million lives a year, with an estimated 31% of all deaths globally and a EU cost of 139 billion euros. Up to 40% of all deaths occur among the elderly. In spite of all medical efforts, the 5-year mortality was reduced significantly less than that of malignant diseases. This highlights the urgent need to overcome the difficulties associated with present pharmacological therapies (i.e. drug instability, and unspecific targeting) by developing new ground-breaking therapeutic strategies that go far beyond any current regimens. New approaches for safe, efficient, and heart-specific delivery of therapeutics are strongly required. CUPIDO is envisioned to meet these critical needs by providing an unconventional and effective strategy based on nanoparticle-assisted delivery of clinically available and novel therapeutics to the diseased heart. In particular, CUPIDO will develop innovative bioinspired hybrid nanoparticles formulated as biologicals delivery, which are i) biocompatible and biodegradable, ii) designed for crossing biological barriers, and iii) guidable to the heart. A combination of multidisciplinary manufacturing and validation approaches will be employed, bringing the envisioned product beyond the currently available clinical and day-to-day management of CD individuals. Scale-up production,  and respect of medical regulatory requirements will allow CUPIDO to deliver a final product for future late pre-clinical and clinical studies. Altogether, CUPIDO will foster the translation of nanomedical applications toward the cardiac field, which although still in its start, offers great potential to overcome the limitations associated to the currently pharmacological treatments.",False
"Title: Airport IQ - Situation-Aware Mobile Platform for Airport Collaborative Decision-Making Abstract: The economic costs of aircraft delays in Europe have been estimated at 1.25Bn Euros per year. Aircraft delays also result in environmental costs: aircraft holding or queuing with engines on, resulting in excess environmental emissions and air quality or noise impact, unnecessary ground movements and activation of auxiliary power units.
Airport IQ will develop a mobile information sharing system connecting back-end A-CDM systems with mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and other wearable devices) carried by ground staff. The system will provide the right information at the right place and time to the right people, making it easier for planners to make optimal use of resources. This will help reduce primary and reactionary delays, improve the reliability of estimates, and allow airlines to make smarter decisions about turnaround buffers, that will be shorter than before.  Airport IQ will also offer a simple way to simulate turnaround activities, making it possible to run operational exercises using the same mobile tools, which will simplify and improve the quality of training, as well as providing the basis for designing longer-term improvements in ground handling processes. 
The solution has the potential to create significant economic and environmental savings for the entire air transport value chain, as demonstrated by pilot trials  to be organized in 3 European airports (Lisboa, Heathrow and Targu Mures), involving real end-users (i.e. ground handling and other airport staff) using “live” onsite data.

"Title: 3 - DMX Demonstration in Dunkirk Abstract: 3D project aims mainly at demonstrating DMXTM CO2 Capture technology in AMF’s Dunkirk (FR) steel mill on an industrial pilot plant (0.5 tCO2/hr.), bringing TRL from 4 to 7, with 76% of requested EU budget (14,8M€). DMXTM will give Europe an edge in cost, environmental- and energy-efficient recovery of CO2. Downstream requirements are fully considered in studies of conditioning, transport and storage in North Sea aquifers. Waste Heat Recovery well combined with DMXTM process will allow reaching unprecedent CO2 Capture cost under 40 €/tCO2. 
Environmental, societal and stakeholder’s expectations are dealt from the beginning and all-along the project to ensure capability of deploying the CCS cluster on Dunkirk territory. DMXB solvent production will be optimised industrially and environmentally, through LCA.
3D project is based on an EU holistic approach, building on previous an on-going CCS projects where many 3D partners are involved. 2025 full-scale CCS plant of 1 Mt CO2/y will be implemented from end of 3D project which will be an embryo of the future CCS cluster Dunkirk-North Sea 2035 (10 MtCO2/y). It is a major step in the transformation of energy- and CO2-intensive industries such as steel towards EU targets, with opportunities of job creation all along the CO2 CCS chain, notably for Dunkirk region economies and EU storage Hubs. 3D RTD and engineering providers would develop new markets aside from existing Oil & Gas, smoothing environmental and energy-depletion transition. Furthermore, quality of recovered CO2 through DMXTM process  is compatible with food-grade markets.
The project success relies on of a highly skilled and experienced consortium involving the complete chain of CCS and key transversal skills (LCA, SSH, KPI/TRL/cost assessment). 11 complementary partners from 6 European countries, of 2 academics (ETHZ, DTU), 4 technology providers (AP, GASSCO, IFPEN, UETIKON), 3 engineering companies (AXENS, John Cockerill, BREVIK), 2 end-users (AMF, TotalEnergies OneTech).",False
"Title: EPIMAC - The next generation epigenetic medicine for inflammation Abstract: Epigenetic mechanisms allow cells to adjust gene expression in response to environmental cues. Increased understanding of this area has led to excitement about the potential of applying epigenetic regulation to drug discovery. EPIMAC aims to pursue the potential of epigenetics as a novel and innovative therapeutic modality for immuno-inflammatory diseases, in particular Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). 
IBD is a severe and disabling chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract affecting millions of people worldwide. Current treatment strategies are not successful because the precise etiology unclear. It is increasingly clear that deregulated epigenetic processes are associated with the aberrant inflammatory response seen in IBD. Recent reports suggest that inhibitors of epigenetic modifications developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, bear potential in treating inflammatory states (Nicodeme et al, Nature 2010; Kruidenier et al, Nature 2012). 
The EPIMAC consortium has the ambition to educate a group of next-generation scientists that master genetics, epigenetics, target discovery, pharmacology, preclinical validation and regulatory issues, and at the same time have a good understanding of clinical implementations of the drug pipeline of our pharmaceutical partner GSK. GSK is one of the world's leading research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies that aims to team up with academic partners in EPIMAC through its dedicated discovery performance unit named EpiNova in conjunction with 2  immuno-pharmacology units. An SME specializing in epigenetic compound targeting to inflammatory cells, Chroma Therapeutics, will contribute technology to EPIMAC.

"Title: IMPEL - Isoreticular Metal Phosphonates for Energy and Light Abstract: The amount of solar energy received onto the earth in single hour is estimated to be more than the entire annual world energy usage, but at present the implementation and efficiency commercially available of solar cells does not make adequate use of this renewable energy source. It is estimated that 10% of energy usage in the average home, and 20-40% in commercial premises. Furthermore it is predicted that the world will need 30 terawatts (TW) of energy by 2050 which must come from renewables.  The EU Renewable Energy Directive in conjunction with the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive has set targets to increase energy efficiency in excess of 32.5% by 2030. In answer to these challenges there is a need to develop new materials for solar energy conversion (photovoltaics) and low energy lighting. The three key challenges in developing new photovoltaics for the conversion of solar energy to electricity are: high efficiency, low cost and long life.   In this context, this project aims to develop and study of new multifunctional materials to act as hosts for semiconductor quantum dots and nanoparticles, and to use them in the manufacture and study of solar cells and LEDs. It combines the experience of the PI, Prof Gary Hix, in photonic materials and that of the fellow, Dr Konstantinos Papathanasiou in synthesis of porous materials, to deliver materials which will contribute to global and European Clean Energy objectives. The project will provide a vehicle for a  two-way knowledge exchange between the host and fellow, providing the basis for a successful multidisciplinary project spanning chemistry and physics which will also generate data and outcomes that will be of interest to materials scientists and physicists and the wider scientific community in general.

This is an emerging class of wireless systems that leverages the synergy and complementarity of cloudification and edge processing, two key technologies in the evolution towards 5G systems and beyond. Fog-aided wireless networks can reap the bene 
fits of centralization via cloud processing, in terms of capital and operating cost reductions, greening, and
enhanced spectral e fficiency, while, at the same time, being able to cater to low-latency applications, such as the """"tactile"""" internet, by means of localized intelligence at the network edge. The operation of fog-aided wireless networks poses novel fundamental research problems pertaining to the optimal management of the communication, caching and computing resources at the

The solution of these problems challenges the theoretical principles and engineering insights which have underpinned the design of existing networks. The initial research activity on the topic, of which the EU is at the forefront, focuses, by and large, on ad hoc solutions and technologies. In contrast, the goal of this project is to develop fundamental theoretical insights

The theoretical framework is grounded in network information theory, which enables the distillation of design principles, along with signal processing, (non-convex) optimization, queuing and distributed computing to develop and analyse algorithmic solutions.""",True
"Title: MinBioTag - A minimal Cys-cyclobutene non-canonical amino acid for bioorthogonal imaging of proteins in live cells Abstract: Insight into dynamic processes such as uptake and intracellular trafficking and signalling of small molecules and proteins in cells is key in basic biology and drug development. The use of bioorthogonal chemical reactions for labelling and probing specific biomolecules is an exciting option but a very challenging task as these transformations should proceed very rapidly in physiological conditions with complete chemoselectivity. So, in this application we propose to achieve site-selective protein labelling by the introduction of a non-canonical Cys-cyclobutene aminoacid and a very fast alkene chemoselective ligation reaction. The small size of the proposed alkene-tagged aminoacid should not interfere with the protein structure, function, activity or localisation in contrast with other fluorescent tags such as the use of fusion proteins as GFP. This project aims at 1) developing  a new photo triggered [2+2] cycloaddition bioorthogonal ligation between two alkene containing partners and to apply the already established IEDDA reaction between tetrazines and dienophiles. While the use of light as a trigger offers the possibility for an improved spatial and temporal resolution,  the use of tetrazine fluorogenic probes allows for ‘turn-on’ fluorescence on their rapid reaction with dienophiles 2) use these optimized reaction to study apoptosis in cells and tissues by introducing the proposed Cys-cyclobutene non-canonical amino acid into C2A Domain of Synaptotagmin-I followed by the ligation reaction ex vivo and in vivo",False

"Title: iBROW - Innovative ultra-BROadband ubiquitous Wireless communications through terahertz transceivers Abstract: The demand for broadband content and services has been growing at tremendous rates, and predictions indicate that wireless data-rates of multiple tens of Gbps will be required by the year 2020, essentially for short-range connectivity. Currently available wireless technology cannot support these future demands, and so there is an urgent need to develop new technology platforms that are cost and energy efficient to enable ubiquitous ultra-broadband wireless communications seamlessly integrated with high-speed fibre-optic networks, paving the way for 100 Gbps datarates in the long term. The frequency spectrum currently in use is not expected to be suitable to accommodate the predicted future data-rate requirements, and therefore there is a need to embrace higher frequency bands, above 60 GHz and up to 1 THz. iBROW aims at developing a novel, low cost, energy-efficient and compact ultra-broadband short-range wireless communication transceiver technology, capable of addressing predicted future network usage requirements. This will be pursued through the exploitation of Resonant Tunnelling Diode (RTD) devices which represent the fastest pure solid-state electronic devices operating at room temperature with reported working frequencies exceeding 1 THz. Through the development of a unified technology that can be integrated into both ends of the wireless link, namely consumer portable devices and fibre-optic supported base-stations, the project aims at increasing the RTD output power, optical detection efficiency and energy efficiency at target frequencies, developing a methodology for low cost RTD manufacturing on a silicon platform, photonic integration and packaging, as well as identifying appropriate communication methods and architectures to enable its deployment in 10 Gbps short-range wireless communication devices in short term and paving the way for 100 Gbps in long term for both the mm-wave and THz frequency bands, seamlessly integrated with optical fibre networks",True
"Title: MANTEL - Management of Climatic Extreme Events in Lakes  Reservoirs for the Protection of Ecosystem Services Abstract: Environmental perturbations to lakes and reservoirs occur largely as episodic climatic events.  These range from relatively short mixing events to storms and heat waves. While the driving events occur along a continuum of frequency and magnitude, however, their effect is generally longer lasting than the events themselves. In addition, the more extreme weather events are now becoming increasingly frequent, a trend that has been linked to directional climate change and is projected to continue in the coming decades. Understanding the impact of these short-lived pressures requires monitoring that captures the event (hours–days) and the ensuing impact, that can last for months or even years.  Only recently has automated high frequency monitoring (HFM) of lakes been adopted throughout Europe. This Training Network will investigate the effects of the most extreme events, and of cumulative lower magnitude events, using HFM, while at the same time training a cohort of doctoral students in state-of-the art technology, data analysis and modelling. The aim of the EJD is to change the way in which water quality monitoring is carried out so that the effects of episodic climatic events can be understood, thus ensuring that future water management strategies can explicitly account for their effects.",False

"Title: SYSCID - A Systems medicine approach to chronic inflammatory disease Abstract: ""The SYSCID consortium aims to develop a systems medicine approach for disease prediction in CID. We will focus on three major CID indications with distinct characteristics, yet a large overlap of their molecular risk map: inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematodes and rheumatoid arthritis. We have joined 15 partners from major cohorts and initiatives in Europe (e.g.IHEC, ICGC, TwinsUK and Meta-HIT) to investigate human data sets on three major levels of resolution: whole blood signatures, signatures from purified immune cell types (with a focus on CD14 and CD4/CD8) and selected single cell level analyses.  Principle data layers will comprise SNP variome, methylome, transcriptome and gut microbiome. SYSCID employs a dedicated data management infrastructure, strong algorithmic development groups (including an SME for exploitation of innovative software tools for data deconvolution) and will validate results in independent retrospective and prospective clinical cohorts.

"Title: SONATA - Service Programing and Orchestration for Virtualized Software Networks Abstract: Virtualisation and software networks are a major disruptive technology for communications networks, enabling services to be deployed as software functions running directly in the network on commodity hardware. However, deploying the more complex user-facing applications and services envisioned for 5G networks presents significant technological challenges for development and deployment. SONATA addresses both issues.

For service development, SONATA provides service patterns and description techniques for composed services. A customised SDK is developed to boost the efficiency of developers of network functions and composed services, by integrating catalogue access, editing, debugging, and monitoring analysis tools with service packaging for shipment to an operator.

For deployment, SONATA provides a novel service platform to manage service execution. The platform complements the SDK with functionality to validate service packages. Moreover, it improves on existing platforms by providing a flexible and extensible orchestration framework based on a plugin architecture. Thanks to SONATA’s platform service developers can provide custom algorithms to steer the orchestration of their services: for continuous placement, scaling, life-cycle management and contextualization of services. These algorithms are overseen by executives in the service platform, ensuring trust and resolving any conflict between services.

By combining rapid development and deployment in an open and flexible manner, SONATA is realising an extended DevOps model for network stakeholders.

SONATA validates its approach through novel use-case-driven pilot implementations and disseminates its results widely by releasing its key SDK and platform components as open source software, through scientific publications and standards contributions, which, together, will have a major impact on incumbent stakeholders including network operators and manufacturers and will open the market to third-party developers.",True
"Title: ARDITO - Access to rights data via identification technologies optimisation Abstract: Everything is digital today in the creative industries value network. The production process, often the products, the supply chains, and the communication with end users.
The digital world calls for fast and cross-border re-use of creative content in different contexts, at different levels of granularity, for different purposes.
However there is a dark lacuna when it comes to the digital content value network – everything is digital except the actual functioning of the rights supply chains to enable such re-use. When users wish to re-use content, it is very hard to find information on who to ask for permission, which licenses are available, and on which terms and conditions.
This is where the ARDITO project comes into play. The project vision is that any user should be able easily to access such rights information. To obtain this, we need a Rights Data Network (RDN), a network of connected e-infrastructures to automate the exchange of information about rights. We do not start from scratch. The Linked Content Coalition initiative has defined the framework. The RDI project has demonstrated how such RDN could implement the LCC framework; and the Copyright Hub has provided a first implementation of such principles.
The time to go live with actual services is now. A group of SMEs, well established in different creative sectors (books, audio-visual and images), a research centre and the Copyright Hub Foundation decided to promote the ARDITO idea to accelerate the development of the RDN, through optimising a range of content identification technologies (watermarks, content recognition, DOIs) for use in the RDN, integrating them into the Copyright Hub ecosystem, and developing new services, ready to bring to the market.
The services are varied but share the same vision: to be an access point to the RDN offered to different markets. The final aim is to support SMEs in European creative industries in promoting new business ideas through monetising the re-use of their content.",True
"Title: HAoS - Holistic Approach of Spray Injection through a Generalized Multi-phase Framework Abstract: Development of fuel injection equipment (FIE) able to reduce pollutant emissions from liquid-fueled transportation and power generation systems is a top industrial priority in order to meet the forthcoming EU 2020 emission legislations. However, design of new FIE is currently constrained by the incomplete physical understanding of complex micro-scale processes, such as in-nozzle cavitation, primary and secondary atomization. Unfortunately, today’s computing power does not allow for an all-scale analysis of these processes. The proposed program aims to develop a large eddy simulation (LES) CFD model that will account for the influence of unresolved sub-grid-scale (SGS) processes to engineering scales at affordable computing time scales. The bridging parameter between SGS and macro-scales flow processes is the surface area generation/destruction occurring during fuel atomisation; relevant SGS closure models will be developed through tailored experiments and DNS and will be implemented into the LES model predicting the macroscopic spray development as function of the in-nozzle flow and surrounding air conditions. Validation of the new simulation tool, currently missing from today’s state-of-the-art models, will be performed against new benchmark experimental data to be obtained as part of the programme, in addition to those provided by the industrial partners. This will demonstrate the applicability of the model as an engineering design tool suitable for IC engines, gas turbines, fuel burners and even rocket engine fuel injectors. The proposed research and training programme will be undertaken by 15ESRs funded by the EU and one ESR funded independently from an Australian partner; ESRs will be recruited/seconded by universities, research institutes and multinational fuel injection and combustion systems manufacturers that will represent in the best possible way the international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral requirements of the Marie Curie Action guidelines.",False
"Title: DICE - Developing Data-Intensive Cloud Applications with Iterative Quality Enhancements Abstract: The rapid increase in demand for data-intensive applications capable of exploiting Big Data technologies such as Hadoop/MapReduce, NoSQL, cloud-based storage, and stream processing is creating massive growth opportunities for European independent software vendors (ISVs). However, developing software that meets the high-quality standards expected for business-critical cloud applications remains a barrier to this market for many small and medium ISVs, which often lack resources and expertise for advanced quality engineering.

"Title: eBORDER - Secure and Wireless Multimodal Biometric Scanning Device for Passenger Verification Targeting Land and Sea Border Control Abstract: Every year a large number of visitors enter the European Union (EU) by cars, buses, trains or ships through land-border crossing points or sea ports bringing significant economic benefits; in particular, 9% of Europe’s GDP comes from tourism. This trend is set to continue, as Europe further considers visa liberalization agreements in a bid to sustain their competitive stance in the global tourism market. This will create major implications on the security and border management in the EU, as well as diminishing the Quality of Experience for passenger travel.  
Existing directives for controlling border crossing is to conduct checks using biometric data in conjunction with VIS (Visa Information Systems), as specified in the Schengen Border Code. However, current biometric systems rely on one mode of biometric data, that can at times can lead to false identification, in particular under uncontrolled conditions during live sample acquisition. Moreover, the current crop of scanning devices are limited in coverage and typically have fixed links, thus confining the range of border control applications and compromising the comfort of passengers. We aim to go beyond and propose an innovative passenger-centric biometric system that authenticates “on the fly”. We combine the scientific field of wireless security, biometric recognition and data fusion to develop a  secure and wireless multimodal biometric scanning device for passenger verification targeting land and sea border control applications. 
The research approach is the basis for a RISE training action that we refer to as eBORDER, that is foreseen to enhance both the career potential of staff members and innovation capacity at the institutional level. In this context, this action brings together key players from industry and academia with complementary expertise on security, biometrics, data fusion and practical experimentation to train staff by research through intersectorial and international staff exchanges.",True
"Title: ReMIND - Reactivating Neglected Heritages, Reweaving Unspoken Memories. A Study on the Adaptive Reuse of Former Asylums into “mind museums”. Abstract: ReMIND focuses on the potentials for ‘mind museums’(former asylums turned into museums)to provoke emotional responses in visitors and foster critical reflection on the histories and contemporary problems of dealing with mental illness (MI) in society.Its objective is to fill some relevant scientific gaps on the subject, as well as to conjoin complimentary disciplinary approaches from museum and exhibition design and museum studies and develop new research competence for me as fellow and for the host institution in the field of visitor studies.
ReMIND explores the MI heritage landscape through asylums built in Europe from the mid-19th cent until the 60s’ deinstitutionalisation process in the psychiatric care system.Today, most of these buildings still stand where they were, often completely or partially abandoned, left to decay, and contributing to urban decline.ReMIND will survey the European landscape of MI heritage considering phenomena such as abandonment and reuse of historic asylums for cultural purposes.However, alongside this general desk-based overview, its main aim is to analyse former asylums that have been restored and reused as museums, specifically involving 2 indepth interdisciplinary pilot case studies.Nowadays we don’t have a sense of potentials for the responsible adaptive re-use of asylums and they are in danger.Likewise, once converted into museums, their role in effecting attitudinal change in visitors that may help to dismantle stigma and promote awareness toward MI has not been properly investigated.ReMIND addresses these gaps.
To do so my study will integrate various disciplinary approaches to rethink adaptive reuse interventions and contemporary heritage conservation and valorisation practices.I will work at the intersection of different research fields, moving from Italy to UK at New Castle University to learn, deploy and contribute in implementing theories and methodologies related to heritage studies, visitor studies, and display analysis.",False
"Title: Acoutect - A sound fundament for our future buildings Abstract: To ensure a healthy environment for people living and working in buildings, research and engineering in the area of building acoustics is essential. Developments in modern building concepts, such as sustainable low-energy consuming buildings, buildings with lightweight materials and open plan working environments, as well as the need to build in extremely noisy areas, require involvement of acoustic experts in order to successfully (re)design buildings without negatively impacting upon people’s health and well-being. Taking up current and future acoustic challenges requires innovative solutions based on a thorough understanding and mastering of modern methods and tools, as well as a holistic acoustic approach involving acoustic design, products and subjective evaluation. However, in the complex field of building acoustics, research activities typically are not holistic and have become slightly marginalised.

ALS is a fatal condition characterized by progressive motor deficits, degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) and death from neuromuscular respiratory failure in the majority of afflicted individuals within 3-5 years. Currently, the economic burden of care and treatment for patients with ALS/FTD is expensive and continues to significantly rise in Europe and worldwide. While significant genetic discoveries have been made in the field, they have not yet translated to treatment options for patients with ALS and FTD. Thus, research efforts aimed at identifying therapeutic targets are of the utmost importance to enable therapeutic development for these devastating disorders. In this ERC Proof of Concept project, we will design, optimise and test gene therapy vectors containing CRISPR/Cas9 system to selectively remove the pathogenic ALS/FTD-related C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in mouse models of C9orf72-related ALS, with the ultimate aim of designing a therapy for patients with C9orf72-related ALS/FTD. The ultimate benefit of this approach goes far beyond just ALS/FTD however. A successful CNS gene therapy for C9orf72 related disease potentiates the prospect of developing similar approaches to treat multiple disease scenarios amenable to gene modification. Indeed, growing evidence suggests that C9orf72 repeat expansions also contribute to a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and cerebellar ataxias. We therefore anticipate that our strategy could be beneficial for other neurological conditions.",False
"Title: NEUROCLOUD - A neural network builder with remotely controlled parallel computing Abstract: Neural network simulations have been a driving force behind our advances in the artificial intelligence filed, but also a key tool in our understanding of the human brain. However, exploring such networks usually engages substantial computational resources requiring specific programing skills and dedicated facilities. In our main project NETSIGNAL, we have developed computational environment ARACHNE aiming to facilitate high-end neural network exploration among scientific and industrial users. ARACHNE enables an investigator to construct and explore cellular networks of arbitrary biophysical and architectural complexity using a simple interface on a local computer or a mobile device. Through small-file exchange via the internet, the interface controls a pre-configured computational kernel installed on a remote computer cluster or cloud. Uniquely, ARACHNE can integrate traditional wired network connections with diffuse, volume-transmitted type of inter-cellular signalling, to reflect the emerging role of glia in brain processing. ARACHNE thus affords a flexible neural network design and incorporates latest advances in neuroscience while providing a portable console suitable for IT-untrained explorers. ARACHNE has passed a feasibility and novelty test by independent experts (Aleksin et al, PLoS Comp Biology 2017, in press), its test version is available on-line (https://github.com/LeonidSavtchenko/Arachne/). Our goal here is to determine market potential and the commercial viability of ARACHNE and its conceptual design, but also to establish industry-standard provisions for its commercial exploitation. We plan: (a) to upgrade ARACHNE technical specs, interface, support, etc. to the industry standard; (b)  to assess the market and the competitors; (c) to determine IPR position and strategy, (d) to explore budgeting and further funding strategy, (e) to establish initial provisions for its distribution and/or licensing of ARACHNE.",True
"Title: Phasor - The World's first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile, phased array antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move Abstract: The demand for mobile communications is growing at  compound rate CAGR of 61% p.a. and forecast to do so beyond 2022. Global mobile data traffic grew 81 % in 2013 and reached 1.5 Exabyte’s per month at the end of 2013, up from 820 petabytes per month at the end of 2012. Users now demand fast and affordable connectivity when and wherever they are. The growing use/ownership of laptops, tablet computers and larger smart phones has also led to an increasing demand for high quality content such as HD video on the move. 

Current satellite communications antennas cannot fully meet this large and growing need: Mechanically steerable antennas which are bulky, heavy, require maintenance and pose considerable vehicle integration challenges. Phased arrays based on military technology are too costly for commercial applications. Existing low cost antennas trade-off the cost of the antenna against the requirement for much more expensive satellite bandwidth per Mbps transmitted. Their performance is also too limited for use in certain geographical areas (particularly at large skew angles).  

The overall objective of this project therefore is to successfully refine and scale up for market readiness the world’s first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile phased antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move. This will enable us to gain a substantial market share in the € 1.185bn Broadband Satellite Communications-on-the-Move (COTM) market and the associated antenna market which amounts to €0.39bn. Both of which are growing rapidly. We predict that we can achieve a 2.5% market share by 2020, generating total revenues of €134m and a cumulative EBITDA of €63m, creating 781 jobs. Our prototype system technology is demonstrated and proven in a relevant environment and at TRL6. This project will allow us to demonstrate the market disruptive system in an operational environment and then fully scale up the system to market readiness.",True
"Title: MARINA - Maritime LAseR for collisIon avoidance in high speed shippiNg and vessel traffic mAnagement Abstract: Shipping is a key driver of the EU economy, but dense traffic lanes, tighter schedules, high cost of trained staff and
increasingly difficult weather patterns have put serious pressures on sustainability and environmental safety of commercial
shipping. Contact and collision incidences are now the most frequent and overall the costliest type of accidents in the
maritime transport sector. Accidents force 1 out of 10 ships to an unplanned dry dock stay every year, costing on average
€400,000 per incident, and have detrimental impact on the environment due to the release of pollutants into the water. Semi
and fully submerged objects cause concern for shipping because they go undetected by state-of-the-art sensors, presenting
an acute need for improved observation capability of the ocean surface layer. Aware of this clear market need to increase
the global maritime transport industry’s safety, to decrease its environmental impact through collisions and to prepare for a
future of autonomous shipping, the present consortium has developed an innovative solution using a unique and novel
LADAR system. Our new sensor combines state-of-the-art real-time processing with an advanced object detection and
classification algorithm based on machine learning techniques, to detect and classify objects in the ocean surface layer in a
range of up to 2nm ahead of the ship. LADAR’s ability for obstacle detection will allow ship operators to operate their vessels
efficiently and safely, reducing the risk of collision with other ships, driftwood, mammals or submerged containers. MARINA
is a strong and complimentary consortium, where all partners have collaborated together extensively in preceding R&D&I
projects. The aim of the project is to advance the system to TRL8, then to qualify the product in real-life operations to reach
TRL9 and finally to support the commercial viability. Commercialization is expected to lead to an accumulated revenue of
€786m 5 years post-project.",False
"Title: DIAS - Development of Interdisciplinary Assessment for manufacturing and deSign Abstract: DIAS develop and demonstrate the integrated multidisciplinary tools necessary to speed up implantation and design integration or Open Rotor structural components in next generation aircrafts. This require more flexible design studies, allowing a wider set of design variants to be explored simultaneously with accounting for manufacturing equipment and process applicability. 
DIAS bring in state of the art modelling and simulation techniques for robot path assessment, geometrical variation of weld assembly using advanced modelling software and combines these with architectural modelling tools (CCM, CAM) that allow impact assessment on system level, risk and cost to be included in the same study 
The studies are conduced as evolving and digital design of experiments first outlining the desired design space, identifying feasible regimes of the design space and generate variations of geometries and manufacturing technologies. The results from the simulations are used together with already existing data from Clean Sky high fidelity simulations and experiments to form validated surrogate models. Decision makers and specialist from multiple domains team up and conduct real time trade off analyses to identify most resilient design. AI and Machine learning algorithms are used to facilitate intelligent and interactive decision support. 
The consortia of Chalmers, Cambridge and FCC have experience form collaborating both with the topic leader and eachother from several preceeding research projects and bring together extensive expertise and experience into the study. The expected outcome is expected to allow the manufacturer to optimize new design and reduce the risk to introduce Clean Sky demonstrated configurations and technologies to be introduced in next generation products. As such, DIAS have a profound impact on realizing the significant potential demonstrated for Open Rotor architectures, while including competitive assessment and risk reducing design capabilities.",False
"Title: weDRAW - Exploiting the best sensory modality for learning arithmetic and geometrical concepts based on multisensory interactive Information and Communication Technologies and serious games Abstract: The weDRAW project comes from the renewed neuroscientific understanding of the role of communication between sensory modalities during development: specific sensory systems have specific roles to learn specific concepts. Starting from these results, in weDRAW we will develop an multisensory technology and three serious games that will exploit the best modality for learning arithmetic and geometrical concepts.
In particular weDRAW:
- will provide the elements to the teacher to determine which is the best modality (visual, audio or haptic) to teach each specific concepts to the students; 
- will provide the technology to exploit the best sensory signal; 
- will permit to teach different concepts together. This will be possible by using a multisensory approach, that will open a new teaching/learning channel, personalized for each student, based on multisensory interactive technology (i.e., audio, tactile, motor and visual), including a serious game platform. 
- will show that it is possible to learn arithmetical concepts from multisensory rhythm exploration and music and geometrical concepts from body movement and multisensory drawing.
- will permit a “deeper learning of Science and Mathematics combined with Arts” improving creative capacities of learners.
Besides application to typical children, a major goal and output of this project consists of applying the proposed multisensory approach and technologies to two specific populations: visually impaired and dyslexic children. In particular, dyslexic children have problems with rhythm, whereas visually impaired children have problems with space and geometry. With weDRAW we expect to improve the spatial and temporal impairments of these two groups of children braking down social barriers.",False
"Title: SPICES - Space-borne observations for detecting and forecasting sea ice cover extremes Abstract: The main objective of this proposal is to develop new methods to retrieve sea ice parameters from existing (and imminent) satellite sensors to provide enhanced products for polar operators and prediction systems, specifically addressing extreme and unexpected conditions. 
Automatic remote sensing products traditionally provide general information on sea ice conditions such as ice extent and concentration. However, for ice charting, tactical navigation and management of off-shore activities much more important is to know and avoid hazardous sea ice conditions. In general, sea ice hazards are related to sea ice thickness. More often than not polar ships and off-shore platforms are only operating during summer seasons and certain regions. This is because they are designed to resist typical forces of induced by pack ice, but they are not designed to resist the extreme sea ice conditions. 

Ongoing climate warming has manifested as shrinking and thinning of pack ice in the Arctic. This is a primary driver for the increasing shipping, oil and gas explorations and mining activities in the Arctic. However, severe sea ice conditions still exist and in consequence many locations are impossible for ship based operations. Moreover, year-to-year variability of sea ice is very large and hazardous multiyear ice (MYI) floes sometimes appear also in typically seasonally ice free regions.

In order to response needs of increase polar activities, we propose to focus on detection of sea ice extremes and automatic production of “sea ice warnings” products. In particular, we aim for a detection of MYI floes in a area composed mostly first-year ice from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), heavily ridged ice regions from SAR, the thickest ice from radar altimeter (RA) thickness profiles, regional anomalies of thick or thin ice via passive microwave (PMW) data, sea ice areas vulnerable for the wave action, detection of early/late melting season and improving capabilities to forecast seasonal sea ice extremes.",True
"Title: RefugeeBioEmbed - Individual Differences in the Biological Embedding of Developmental Origins of Health and Illness in Syrian Refugee Children Abstract: The Syrian Civil War led to the displacement of more than 5.6 million Syrians in surrounding nations, millions of whom are children. Nations around the world are striving to resolve the economic, cultural, and societal strains of accommodating an unprecedented number of refugees. The proposed project aims to begin tackling this problem by investigating experiences of Syrian refugee children to determine whether individual characteristics influence their psychological and behavioral responses to the Syrian Civil War and subsequent circumstances. The research objectives entail applying innovative, evolutionary-developmental models to explore individual differences in the ways early childhood adversity is biologically embedded and reflected in developmental milestones and mental health. The project applies strong interdisciplinary methods to the analysis of existing, high-quality data to understand the intersections of genetics, endocrinology, psychology, and behavior. The overarching goals of the project are to 1) understand individual differences in the developmental origins of health and illness, 2) identify modifiable risk and protective factors that suppress or enhance refugee mental health, and 3) inform individualized interventions to prevent and treat mental illness among Syrian—and other—displaced populations. Bringing to bear leading experts in neuroendocrinology, genetics, psychiatry, and resilience; high-quality, longitudinal data; and state-of-the-art training in genetic and hormonal data analyses, this project will showcase European excellence in innovative, interdisciplinary, and intersectoral research in child development and public health and policy.",False
"Title: FOROIL - Objective-based forecast evaluations for crude oil volatility. Abstract: Oil price volatility forecasting is of major importance due to the financialisation of the oil market and the fact that the oil market participants’ decisions are based on such forecasting (e.g. oil-intensive industries, policy makers, portfolio traders, etc). Currently, forecasters predict oil price volatility using GARCH and HAR models and evaluate the performance of these models using statistical loss-functions, such as the Mean Absolute Predictive Error. Even more, the literature concentrates mainly its attention on two measures of volatility, namely the conditional volatility and the realized volatility. 
Nevertheless, oil price volatility users are faced with multiple volatility measures, multiple forecasting models and different reasons for which they use oil price volatility forecasts (e.g. policy making, portfolio allocation, risk management). Thus, in order for oil volatility users to make informed decisions, they need to know what the most appropriate volatility measure is and what the most accurate forecasting model is.
This innovative project aims to lay the foundations for an advanced econometric model framework for the evaluation of the best oil volatility measures along with the best forecasting models, using objective-based loss functions.  
The outcome of this fellowship will be a toolbox, containing the aforementioned framework. The project will have a great impact on the fellow as it will allow him to advance his existing scientific skills through the cutting-edge training in the state-of-the-art oil volatility forecasting techniques, in energy finance and in the field of consulting. Overall, the research training will allow the fellow to develop a pioneering research agenda in energy finance and will position him as an internationally recognised scholar that contributes further to the research excellence in Europe. Even more, this fellowship will have a great impact on the supervisor, the host institution and the European Research Area.",False
"Title: ProTego - Data-protection toolkit reducing risks in hospitals and care centers Abstract: Health care is an essential service that uses a great deal of sensitive personal data which has a high black market value being a lucrative target for data theft and ransomware attacks.The EU NIS Directive (EU 2016/1148) and GDPR (EU 2016/679) will harmonize and improve information security in Europe. Both require relevant ICT infrastructure operators to perform risk assessments, introduce appropriate security measures to manage identified risks, and report security breaches. Unfortunately, risk-based approaches are notoriously difficult to implement in a consistent and comprehensive fashion. They depend on a high level of understanding of both cybersecurity and of the system or network to be protected, are labour intensive and costly and typically done by small teams. This is increasingly inappropriate as health care providers introduce IoT systems, cloud services and (in the near future) 5G networks to provide services in which patients are more engaged, may own some of the devices used, and want access in hospitals, on the move or at home. The ProTego project will develop a toolkit and guidelines to help health care systems users address cybersecurity risks in this new environment by introducing 3 main advances over current approaches: Extensive use of machine intelligence: a combination of machine inference exploiting a priory knowledge for security-by-design, and machine learning from data for run-time threat detection and diagnosis; Advanced data protection measures: advanced encryption techniques and hardware based full memory encryption, and multi-stakeholder IAM to control access to and by user devices, to protect data at rest and provide ultra-secure data exchange portals; Innovative protocols for stakeholder education: using security-by-design analysis to target training and support stakeholders to contribute to networok overall security.The toolkit will be integrated and validated in IoT and BYOD-based case studies at two hospitals.",True
"Title: MUYA - The Multimedia Yasna Abstract: What exactly are the words which priests recite in the Yasna, the core ritual of one of the most ancient and influential living religions, Zoroastrianism? What is their meaning and how do they relate to the ritual actions? The Yasna is significant for our cultural heritage not only because of its influential thought system which arguably impacted on post-exilic Judaism, nascent Christianity and Islam, but also because with parts of it going back to the 2nd millennium BCE, it is the oldest witness to Iranian languages. Its full appreciation, however, is severely hampered by the presence of outdated editions and translations or by their absence altogether. Moreover, the relationship between the text recited and the action performed during the ritual is unexplored due to a lack of documentary evidence. The Multimedia Yasna proposes to fill these gaps in a methodologically ground-breaking fashion.
MUYA combines two different, yet complementary approaches by examining the Yasna both as a ritual performance and as a text attested in manuscripts. The two approaches will be integrated to answer questions about the meaning and function of the Yasna in a historical perspective. The research methods for achieving MUYA’s objectives unite cutting edge approaches from Digital Humanities, Philology and Linguistics into four interrelated work-packages. These will involve filming and analyzing the ritual performance and teaching practices in priestly schools, the creation of a suite of electronic tools for editing Avestan texts, a database of transcribed manuscripts of the Yasna and in-depth studies of selected parts of the text by combining datasets produced by electronic processes with philological methods of textual criticism and linguistic analysis. These complementary datasets and methods will be used to produce an online publication of the sub-titled and interactive film of the Yasna ritual, together with print editions, translations and commentaries of the Avestan Yasna.",False
"Title: AutoProbe - Automated Probabilistic Black-Box Verification Abstract: One of the longstanding challenges in Computer Science has been the development of methods and tools providing rigorous guarantees about systems’ behavior, performance, and security. There have been many successes in overcoming this challenge, notably the invention and widespread use of model checking. However, existing methods are impaired by the tension between the need of fast developing systems and the slowdown caused by the complexity of providing a model against which running systems can be verified.  Automata learning – automated discovery of automata models from system observations such as test logs – is emerging as a highly effective bug-finding technique with applications in verification of bank cards and basic network communication protocols. The design of algorithms for automata learning is a fundamental research problem and in the last years much progress has been made in developing and understanding of new algorithms (including the PI’s own work). Yet, existing algorithms do not support crucial quantitative or concurrency aspects that are essential in modelling properties such as network congestion and fault-tolerance.  The central objective of this project is to develop a new verification framework that enables automated model- based verification for probabilistic and concurrent systems, motivated by applications in networks. We will provide active learning algorithms, in the style of Angluin’s seminal L* algorithm, for automata models that were so far too complex to be tackled. We will base our development on rigorous semantic foundations, developed by the PI in recent years, which provide correctness for the algorithms in a modular way.  The project will significantly advance model-based verification in new and previously unexplored directions. This line of research will not only result in fundamental theoretical contributions and insights in their own right but will also impact the practice of concurrent and probabilistic network verification.",False
"Title: CCLAD - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage Abstract: The way in which normative principles (“norms”) matter in world politics is now a key area of international relations research. Yet we have limited understanding of why some norms emerge and gain traction globally whereas others do not. The politics of loss and damage related to climate change offers a paradigm case for studying the emergence of - and contestation over - norms, specifically justice norms. The parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have recently acknowledged that there is an urgent need to address the inevitable, irreversible consequences of climate change. Yet within this highly contested policy area - which includes work on disaster risk reduction; non-economic losses (e.g. loss of sovereignty);  finance and climate-related migration - there is little consensus about what loss and damage policy means or what it requires of the global community, of states and of the (current and future) victims of climate change. Relying on an interdisciplinary theoretical approach and an ethnographic methodology that traverses scales of governance, my project - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD) - will elucidate the conditions under which a norm is likely to become hegemonic, influential, contested or reversed by introducing a new understanding of the fluid nature of norm-content. I argue that norms are partly constituted through the practices of policy-making and implementation at the international and national level. The research will examine the micro-politics of the international negotiations and implementation of loss and damage policy and also involves cross-national comparative research on domestic loss and damage policy practices. Bringing these two streams of work together will allow me to show how and why policy practices shape the evolution of climate justice norms. CCLAD will also make an important methodological contribution through the development of political ethnography and “practice-tracing” methods.",False
"Title: RESOLVE - Reconstructing the History of Lunar Volatiles Abstract: One of the most exciting recent discoveries in the field of Planetary Sciences has been the confirmation of the presence of water and other associated volatiles in the Moon. These findings have come via laboratory measurements of returned lunar samples exploiting the latest advancements in analytical instrumentation and in-situ techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Not only has the latest research revolutionized our understanding of the abundance and distribution of volatiles on the lunar surface and in the lunar interior, but it has also highlighted potential roles of their different sources and processes imparting specific isotopic signatures to lunar volatiles.

RESOLVE aims at understanding how the abundance and the distribution of volatile components, as well as their isotopic composition are influenced by the crystal structure of the host mineral. The volatile-bearing minerals – primarily phosphates – respond to pressure increase caused by an impact event through modification of their crystal structures, resulting in not only redistribution of the volatile elements (e.g., H, Cl, F), but also of the stable (e.g., H, D, 37Cl) and radiogenic (e.g., 207Pb) isotopes. Therefore, phosphate minerals have the extraordinary potential to simultaneously provide an opportunity for precise age-determination of an impact event, as well as to track any associated modification in the indigenous isotopic signatures of their volatile components. 

Once we better understand the crystal-chemical-isotopic behaviour of lunar volatiles by a multi-analytical approach combining in-situ elemental, stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry with structural characterization, we can then begin to discriminate between different sources (solar wind, cosmic radiation, etc.) of water and other associated volatiles. This allows us to address one of the remaining puzzles in the inner Solar System - the origin of water.",False
"Title: MindSpaces - MindSpaces - Art-driven adaptive outdoors and indoors design Abstract: MindSpaces aims to create a novel approach to urban and architectural design by generating 3D-VR immersive and emotion-adaptive ‘neuro-environments’ that will help in designing emotionally-relevant urban spaces. The emotional aspects of an environment will be captured through the use of mobile EEG (Elecroencephalography) headsets, wearable bracelets/watches, and other physiological sensors that will be embedded with a VR-headset, so as to allow capturing the neuro-feedback of a VR-experience. The neuro-feedback will allow the virtual space to be adapted accordingly, resulting in an emotion-adaptive space. The ‘neuro-environments’ will be used at two levels of granularity. At the first level, artists and creatives will experience the ‘neuro-environments’ with the intention to improve the emotional-relevance of the urban space through the neuro-feedback of individuals, that have very-well developed the perception of aesthetics in what refers to symmetry and harmony but also to unconventional thinking leading to unexpected solutions. At the second level, the ‘neuro-environments’ will be experienced by the potential occupants of the urban space, so as to improve the emotional-relevance of this space through the neuro-feedback of individuals that have developed through experience the perception of space usability, comfort and functionality. This will allow MindSpaces to combine the transversal competencies and unconventional thinking of Artists, with the empirical and pragmatic perception of actual occupants, so as to drive the development of unconventional and unexpected solutions in the design of urban spaces.",False
"Title: EcoDA - Experimental co-Design Approaches: Investigating possibilities for creating networks of resilient citizens and civic actions of urban resilience through hybrid platforms Abstract: EcoDA investigates methods for co-designing platforms that can stimulate collective civic actions of urban resilience and enhance the capacities of urban residents to become resilient. The project focuses on food practices as case studies of resilient actions and tests a hybrid platform in three European cities – London, Paris and Bucharest. The research has three main objectives: 1) to examine the social, cultural, political and technological contexts for urban resilience, and map existing civic initiatives around resilient food practices in the three selected cities; 2) to co-design, prototype, test and refine open source digital platforms that could enable such civic initiatives to take place and/or expand, and enhance resilience capacities for citizens; and 3) to evaluate the capacity of these co-designed platforms to generate forms of public participation and urban governance that can stimulate actions of urban resilience. To address these objectives, the research will be carried out through design practice, through secondments within three professional practices working in the area of urban resilience, in the three elected cities. The methodology includes traditional qualitative methods (e.g., interviews), participatory action research, co-design experiments and collaborative workshops. The innovative and original aspects of EcoDA offer significant value in the context of the Horizon 2020 EU Programme, by addressing areas of special focus (e.g., sustainable food security and waste management) and key objectives (e.g. boosting industry engagement and supporting innovation). Moreover, the practice-based research approach, the open-source nature of the platform and the provision of the ‘metadata’ needed to enable the platform, will facilitate the up-scaling and up-taking of EcoDA’s outcomes in various cities across Europe and possibly further away, thus enabling collaborations beyond the term of the project.",False
"Title: EvolutioNeuroCircuit - Cellular and genetic bases of neural circuits evolution Abstract: Sensory systems encode the world around us to produce context-dependent appropriate behaviours. However, we know little about the way new sensory evoked behaviours arise as neural circuits are re-shaped during evolution. Tackling this question requires a deep understanding of the circuits underlying specific behaviours and integration of this knowledge with tools from other fields, including evolutionary and developmental biology. Recent technological advancements on neural circuit interrogation and genome editing have put progress on this fundamental biological question within reach. 
The olfactory system of the larval stage of the fly Drosophila melanogaster and related species is an ideal model for investigating these questions because (i) D. melanogaster has pioneered both the fields of population genetics and neurogenetics and (ii) its olfactory system is one of the best-characterised neural circuits. We will address the question of how olfactory circuits evolve by studying four species with divergent odour-guided behaviours through the following multidisciplinary aims:
1. Which olfactory pathways are targeted in the evolution of ecological specialisation? – Combining high-throughput behavioural assays, optogenetics and calcium imaging in the larva of all four species we will determine whether/which olfactory pathways have switched valences or sensitivity.
2. How have central neural circuits diverged? – We will address this question at unprecedented resolution through whole-brain calcium imaging and serial electron microscopy reconstruction.
3. What are the molecular and genetic bases of neural circuits rewiring during evolution? – Using transcriptomic profiling we will identify differentially expressed genes in conserved and divergent circuits across species, and functionally probe selected candidates to establish causality.
4. How do evolutionary forces shape olfactory circuits? – We will investigate this question using field studies and population genetics",False
"Title: G4-PTROs - Regulatory network of G-quadruplex dependent Post-Transcriptional mRNA Operons (PTROs) Abstract: Many studies of global gene expression focus solely on studying the transcriptome thereby only assessing mRNA abundance. However, transcription is only a single layer of gene expression and recently, the influence of post-transcriptional regulation has become undeniable. Rather underrepresented players in post-transcriptional control are G-quadruplexes (G4s). These stable structures can form guanine tetrads in DNA and RNA via p-p-stacking of several planar arrangements of four guanine bases stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and a central metal cation. Recent reports have pointed to an important regulatory role of G4 motives in key cellular functions including pre-mRNA processing, RNA turnover, mRNA transport thereby suggesting intriguing links to human diseases as cancer and neurological disorders. G4 structures in mRNAs seem to act as signaling components that constitute an own post-transcriptional operon. Recruitment of G4-specific RBPs then determines the ultimate fate of G4-containing mRNAs. Not many RBPs or upstream regulatory factors of G4s have been identified and the functional consequences of these interactions are not known. In this proposal I will address these questions. First, I will identify mRNAs that are differentially translated and/or stabilized in the presence of the G4 specific ligand pyridostatin (PDS), which stabilizes G4 structures. The resulting comprehensive list of mRNAs will be the first data set that provides a mechanistically link of G4 motive regulation. Secondly, I will identify factors in the G4 regulatory network using a genome wide shRNA assay to determine proteins that modulate the stability and/or the translation of G4 motive containing mRNAs. It is important to understand G4 structure-function relationships and upstream regulatory processes as the emerging link between G4 formation and human disease opens up an exciting research direction that has potential implications for therapeutic intervention.",False
"Title: HUTER - HUMAN UTERUS CELL ATLAS Abstract: The Human Uterus Cell Atlas (HUTER) project aims to create the single-cell and spatial reference map of the human uterus. HUTER project will provide unprecedented insight at transcriptomic, genomic and spatial changes of this important female organ not only throughout the menstrual cycle but also across lifespan. 

The human uterus is a flagship reproductive organ with profound implications not only in reproduction but also in women´s health. HUTER can advance the Human Cell Atlas initiative for the exploitation potential in Obstetrics and Gynaecology  and biomedicine research areas such as Regenerative Medicine or Reproductive Medicine. The uterus is itself a model for regenerative medicine since (i) endometrial tissue regenerates monthly and its transformation is executed through dynamic changes in states and interactions of multiple cell types, and (ii) myometrial tissue has remarkable regenerative capacity and extensive remodelling throughout pregnancy. 

Hence, the primary motivation HUTER proposal stems from the need to better understand the human uterus in order to more effectively address uterine diseases that impact women´s health such as myomas or endometriosis and/or might contribute to infertility, infant and maternal mortality and morbidity. HUTER technological and biological platform will be a crucial resource for the scientific and clinical communities to define the cellular basis of health and disease, allowing the rapid development of new diagnosis and prognosis tools and therapeutic advancements in the field.",False

"Title: OHPF - Optimizing for Happiness in Personal Finance Abstract: In this project, we will (1) investigate the ability to use the log of emotional states captured with wearable trackers for improving affective forecasting abilities of people, (2) build a tool for managing personal finance that integrates prediction analytics, and (3) evaluate if accurate expectations about purchases increase happiness of individuals. 

Happiness and wealth are important metrics in our society with no simple relationship between them. One explanation for why money does not buy happiness is that individuals often have imprecise expectations about things they buy: imprecise forecasting of the nature, intensity and duration of an affective response derived from a purchase. Current technology enables people to track how money is spent to help take control of one’s personal finance, balancing income and expenses, and achieving financial goals. A similar trend is present in tracking of emotional well-being of people through novel wearable sensors emerging from the Quantified Self movement. This project harnesses these unique and timely developments in improving the positive impact wealth can have on happiness. We will improve the accuracy of affective forecasts about future purchases by keeping history of emotional states and associated spending, performing prediction analytics based on the collected data, and providing feedback about anticipated affective value of the purchases.

"Title: FloatMastBlue - Offshore Wind Energy Cost Reduction by an Innovative Floating Met Mast Platform Abstract: FloatMast is a floating platform that performs the best wind data measurements for the most promising and advanced Blue Energy activity, Offshore Wind Parks (OWPs). These wind measurements are vital for the cost benefit analysis of OWPs as they are used in the estimation of the annual income. Moreover, the wind measurements are also critical to the definition of the Operation and Maintenance costs as they are used in the design specification of the OWP’s turbines, towers and foundations. The wind measurements collected by FloatMast are according to the highest industry standard (IEC 61400-12-1) and provide the greatest net benefit to the Developers of OWPs. It can perform wind measurements at a 70% lower cost, by combining the best features from the two existing solutions: the meteorological mast and the Lidar remote sensor device on a stable floating platform. Furthermore, it is re-usable and provides the added value of being re-deployed in other locations of interest. It can be used at all stages of the life cycle of the OWP, from the design phase to the development and operational phase and until the decommissioning phase, twenty years later. Moreover, the platform can perform multi-purpose measurements as it can incorporate oceanographic instruments and environmental sensors, providing a fully integrated solution for a complete monitoring of the OWP site. The innovation has been developed by two Greek SMEs, it has been patented and certified,  tested in a tank test at a 1:25 scale model, constructed at 1:1 physical scale, launched to the sea and conducted a series of tests with perfect compliance. The design and hydrodynamic behavior of the platform have been proven and the next stage involves enhancements and upgrades. Finally, the platform must undergo a demonstration phase in the operational environment in order to provide the needed verification of its operational capabilities and advance the already 2,3 m Euros investment to the commercialization phase.",True
"Title: SOGICA - Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Claims of Asylum: A European human rights challenge Abstract: This project will generate the first ever theoretically and empirically-grounded comparative and comprehensive picture of the status and legal experiences of asylum-seekers across Europe claiming international protection on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI), and determine how the European asylum systems can treat more fairly asylum claims based on the claimant’s SOGI. Every year, thousands of individuals claim asylum in Europe based on their SOGI, and more often than not their claims are treated unfairly, especially considering the disproportionately high rate of refusals on these grounds. There have been very limited attempts to address this issue, and this research will overcome this gap by carrying out a study more comprehensive than any other done in this field in the past, and producing outcomes that are unparalleled in terms of their reach. 

My main objectives are: 1) to analyse how SOGI related claims are adjudicated in different asylum legal European frameworks (EU, CoE, Germany, Italy, UK), and 2) to produce detailed policy recommendations in regard to the national, European Union and Council of Europe asylum adjudication systems, to the effect of developing a system that addresses adequately the socio-cultural, gender identity and sexual diversity of asylum-seekers. 

For the first time, a combined comparative, interdisciplinary (socio-legal), human rights and empirical approach will be adopted to research this field, which requires a substantial long period of research and sustained funding. This approach ensures the unique character of the findings and their impact on improving the current law, policy and decision-making regarding SOGI asylum claims, which are increasingly under close scrutiny across Europe. I am in a unique position to achieve these objectives, in the light of my experience with publications , projects and NGOs in the field of human rights and refugees from socio-legal, empirical and European perspectives.",False
"Title: 5GINFIRE - Evolving FIRE into a 5G-Oriented Experimental Playground for Vertical industries Abstract: Key industrial sectors e.g. automotive, are rapidly transformed by digital and communication technologies leading to the fourth industrial revolution. New ones are in the making, e.g. Smart Cities, which inspire a new breed of applications and services. The salient characteristic of these sectors, known as verticals, is that they are rapidly becoming open ecosystems built on top of common physical infrastructures and resources. This requires a high degree of technological convergence among vertical industries empowering them with enhanced technical capacity to trigger the development of new, innovative products, applications and services.

5G network infrastructures and embodied technologies are destined to “become a stakeholder driven, holistic environment for technical and business innovation integrating networking, computing and storage resources into one programmable and unified infrastructure”. It is this 5G vision that when it is further projected to accommodate verticals raises a number of technical issues Motivated by them, 5GinFIRE project aspires to address two interlinked questions:
- Q1: How such a holistic and unified environment should look like?
- Q2: How can 5GinFIRE host and integrate verticals and concurrently deal with reconciling their competing and opposing requirements?

Addressing these key questions, 5GinFIRE main technical objective is to build and operate an Open, and Extensible 5G NFV-based Reference (Open5G-NFV) ecosystem of Experimental Facilities that integrates existing FIRE facilities with new vertical-specific ones and enables experimentation of vertical industries.

In order to guarantee architectural and technological convergence the proposed environment will be built in alignment with on-going standardization and open source activities. Accordingly, the Open5G-NFV FIRE ecosystem may serve as the forerunner experimental playground wherein innovations may be proposed before they are ported to emerging “mainstream” 5G networks.",True
"Title: RECOBA - Cross-sectorial real-time sensing, advanced control and optimisation of batch processes saving energy and raw materials Abstract: In many aspects batch processes are superior to continuous. Therefore it is worthwhile to take advantage of recent progress in sensor technologies, modelling and automation to develop a new paradigm for the design and conduction of batch processes: a) operation at maximum efficiency, b) dynamic, quality driven process trajectories rather than fixed schedules c) detailed analysis and tracking of all relevant process and product parameter. The main objective of the proposed project is the maximization of efficiency (reg. quality, energy, raw materials, and costs) of batch processes. 
Integrated process control is essential for an efficient operation of industrial batch processes: it tracks the evolution of product properties, detects deviations from the target values for product quality and derives corrective actions at a stage when an automatic compensation of deviations from an optimal trajectory is still possible. This contributes to optimal energy and raw material utilisation, shortens production time and enhanced the product quality. 
With the ambition to deliver solutions with relevance to all sectors of the process industries, the RECOBA consortium represents a selection of batch processes operating industries and partners across the value chain of batch process control, among them 3 global players from the polymer industry (BASF), the steel industry (TKSE), and the silicon metal industry (ELKEM). 
Within RECOBA there will be developed and validated:
(1) new & innovative solutions for the measurement of different types of quality aspects, 
(2) new models to realise integrated process control of batch processes & suitable online parameter adaptation technologies to keep these models valid,
(3) control modules to realise concepts for real-time, model based & closed loop process control, which are easily adaptable to existing batch processes in various industrial sectors,
(4) business models to approach relevant industrial sectors for a future market entry.",False

"Title: SURG-Africa - Scaling up Safe Surgery for District and Rural Populations in Africa Abstract: In sub-Saharan Africa 95% of the population has no access to surgical services. In this region surgery – a proven and often life-saving intervention – is only accessible to urban populations, with only one surgeon per 2.5 million people in rural areas. Emerging evidence demonstrates that major surgery can be undertaken safely and effectively at district hospitals, making it accessible to otherwise neglected rural populations. 

Objectives: Guided by a health systems-strengthening framework and a comprehensive programme of research, Scaling up Safe Surgery for District and Rural Populations in Africa will scale up the delivery of accessible, elective and emergency surgery at district hospitals to national level programmes in three African countries: Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania. 

How objectives will be achieved: SURG-Africa is a tested intervention, drawing lessons from two large-scale successful interventions coordinated by members of this SURG-Africa consortium (one FP7 EC funded) that have trained and supervised non-physician clinicians to deliver essential and emergency surgery in four African countries. Platformed on comprehensive surgical systems analyses, it will put in place national surgical information systems; and will test innovative interventions for making specialist supervision of district surgery feasible and affordable. Epidemiological, economics and implementation research will evaluate impact, and provide evidence for policymakers. 

SURG-Africa directly addresses all aspects of Topic SC1-PM-21-2016: Implementation research for scaling- up of evidence based innovations and good practice in Europe and low and middle-income countries. The results will be transferable and scalable national surgical systems models, with implications for national budget factored in, for making safe surgical services accessible, equitable and sustainable in Africa, especially for women in rural areas.",True
"Title: MORPHEMIC - Modelling and Orchestrating heterogeneous Resources and Polymorphic applications for Holistic Execution and adaptation of Models In the Cloud Abstract: MORPHEMIC proposes a unique way of adapting and optimizing Cloud computing applications by introducing the novel concepts of polymorph architecture and proactive adaptation. The former is when a component can run in different technical forms, i.e. in a Virtual Machine (VM), in a container, as a big data job, or as serverless components, etc. The technical form of deployment is chosen during the optimization process to fulfil the user’s requirements and needs. The quality of the deployment is measured by a user defined and application specific utility. Depending on the application’s requirements and its current workload, its components could be deployed in various forms in different environments to maximize the utility of the application deployment and the satisfaction of the user. Proactive adaptation is not only based on the current execution context and conditions but aims to forecast future resource needs and possible deployment configurations. This ensures that adaptation can be done effectively and seamlessly for the users of the application. The MORPHEMIC deployment platform will therefore be very beneficial for heterogeneous deployment in distributed environments combining various Cloud levels including Cloud data centres, edge Clouds, 5G base stations, and fog devices. Advanced forecasting methods, including the ES-Hybrid method recently winning the M4 forecasting competition, will be used to achieve the most accurate predictions. The outcome of the project will be implemented in the form of the complete solution, starting from modelling, through profiling, optimization, runtime reconfiguration and monitoring. Then the MORPHEMIC implementation will be integrated as a pre-processor for the existing MELODIC platform extending its deployment and adaptation capabilities beyond the multi-cloud and cross-cloud to the edge, 5G, and fog. This approach allows for a path to early demonstrations and commercial exploitation of the project results.",True

"Title: Mapping Anna - The Politics of Cultural Exchange: Anna of Denmark and the Uses of European Identity Abstract: """"""The Politics of Cultural Exchange: Anna of Denmark and the Uses of European Identity"""" investigates how cultural exchange operates across the confessional and geographic divides of pre-modern Europe through a transnational case study of Anna of Denmark (1574-1619), Queen of Scotland and England. This synoptic study combines her vernacular patronage with new evidence of her European connections manifested in her Latin diplomatic correspondence and her material artefacts and commissions. Analysis of new archival, visual, and material sources in Denmark, England, Scotland, and Sweden illuminates Anna’s networks and agendas. Her Latin correspondence offers insights into how she negotiated linguistic and political barriers; her commissions of artists, architects, garden designers, musicians, and scholars demonstrate her pan-European cultural connections. Reformulating theories of agency, analysing interactions between physical and intangible cultural artefacts, and examining the strategic use of 'national' labels as tools of political communication, this project raises academic and public awareness about women’s role in history, redefining how European culture spanned national borders. Located between the fields of material and visual history, theatre, and literary criticism, it reshapes interpretations of national identity, female agency, and spatial politics. Thus, it opens up neglected areas of European gender and culture histories, responding to concerns articulated by the ESF (among others) over sustaining the cultural literacy of the next generation. """"Mapping Anna"""" innovates by using performance as research and as an effective dissemination tool. Alongside generating a major monograph, the project re-stages """"Cupid’s Banishment"""" (performed for Anna in 1617), bringing together undergraduate actors, academics, heritage workers, and members of the public to generate broad interest in Anna and female patronage, giving new significance to European women’s heritage.""",False
"Title: IN2ZONE - The Next Generation of Railway Transition Zones Abstract: IN2ZONE will design and test a prototype next generation transition zone solution that provides a step-change in track support conditions, resulting in a reduction in maintenance interventions. The new solution will combine the newest existing transition solutions with technological advances from other sectors, including recent advances in material science. This interdisciplinary approach will improve both the track super-structure and sub-structure designs, thus ensuring the whole system stiffness is optimised. To increase lifespan, advanced automatic irregularity correcting sleepers will be designed, that are synthetic and optimised for transition zones. This will enable the transition zone solution to self-correct minor vertical track geometry irregularities/faults. Further, the solution architecture will be modular to ensure the benefits are realised in minimal time. 

The new design will be optimised using the latest advances in discrete and finite element numerical simulation tools, coupled with computational fluid dynamics. The concept will then be constructed and tested at large-scale in an accelerated track testing laboratory facility. This gives a rare and valuable opportunity to develop and test the transition zone solution installation, maintenance and decommissioning, while also assessing long-term settlement behaviour.

In addition to the new design, an advanced resilience-based monitoring specification for transition zones will be developed, which will fuse data from multiple track, vehicle and satellite sensors, using edge computing and artificial intelligence to achieve an Industry 4.0 approach for just-in-time maintenance.

"Title: LIAE - Laughing in an Emergency: Humour, Cultural Resilience and Contemporary Art Abstract: In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015, humour has been regarded as serious, incendiary, and potentially fatal business. A curious phenomenon has simultaneously occurred in contemporary art, as artists located around the world have turned to humorous aesthetic strategies in order to document and re-assess global politics, experiences of crisis and collective trauma. In spite of this turn, and although the politics of humour has attracted recent attention, leading scholars across the social sciences and humanities continually lament the lack of scholarly analysis on the subject. In this context, the main objectives of LIAE are 1) to develop a conceptual framework and gather empirical information to account for the impetus behind the emergence of humour in art from contemporary sites of ‘crisis’; 2) to develop a novel framework of how humour advances the social function of art by operating as a vital agent of cultural resilience in three keys ways: re-enforcing connection to place, coalescing collective identity, and by subverting oppressive authority structures; 3) to develop a conceptual framework that accounts for how ‘high art’ settings radically differs to that of ‘viral’ or ‘demotic’ forms (cartoons, memes and street art). To achieve this, LIAE is informed by a comparative study of 3 key case studies, each legislatively recognized as sites of crisis, and each emblematic of particular forms of contemporary ‘emergency’: economic/refugee crisis (Greece), indigenous sovereignty/endemic disadvantage (Australia) and military conflict/occupation (Palestine). Employing an adaptive form of visual culture research (discourse analysis, fieldwork, in-situ visual analysis, archival and primary research) refined through a training program and expert supervision at UNIMAN, LIAE produces innovative research on the social function of humour, unpacking the capacity for art to act as tool of cultural resilience for disadvantaged, marginalised and vulnerable groups.",False

Effectively harnessing the potential of all these innovative and heterogeneous features and providing a programmable multi-tenant network architectural framework will be the key to the success of 5G, and will be the main objective of the 5G-AURA project. Instead of focusing separately on the optimization of the diverse technological and architectural components, our efforts will be concentrated on providing a unifying framework that will sustain the coexistence and coordination of networking, software and cloud technologies, ensure network programmability and efficient resource orchestration, minimize control and signalling overhead, support multi-tenancy and scalability, and promote the development of new business models for emerging services. To efficiently achieve these objectives, 5G-AURA has identified 12 specific research challenges which have been mapped to 14 individual projects that will be carried out by 14 recruited ESRs. The project’s consortium, formed by four academic institutions and four industrial partners, has the necessary expertise and available infrastructures to form a high quality training network across multiple disciplines, sectors and countries. Considering that 5G is currently in an early development state and there are multiple open issues on 5G protocols, network architectures and technologies and standardization efforts, the timing of 5G-AURA is perfect, and the project has a strong potential to have significant impact on academia and industry and enhance the European innovation capacity in terms of technical contributions, intersectoral training of scientists and professional and novel business opportunities.",True
"Title: EXOCONDENSE - Climate Dynamics of Exoplanets with Condensible Atmospheres Abstract: Condensible substances, which undergo a phase change from gaseous to liquid or solid condensed form, have a profound impact on planetary atmospheres, and are central to the determination of most key aspects of a planet's climate. The three phases of water operating in Earth's present climate provide the archetype for condensible processes in climate dynamics, but the dawning age of exoplanet discovery and characterization requires that the understanding of phase change effects be expanded far beyond the situations familiar from the study of Earth's climate, or indeed of the climate of any Solar System planet.  The goal of this project is to pioneer the advances needed to understand condensible climate dynamics for the vastly broader range of condensible substances, thermodynamic and planetary configurations presented by the growing catalogue of exoplanets.  The emphasis will be on the smaller range of planets (super-Earth to Earth mass or size class), which need not have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and therefore present a richer and highly challenging variety of possible condensible behavior. This class of planets includes all planets that are potentially habitable for Earthlike life, but even planets that are far from habitable shed light on essential features of planets in the Universe, and will be studied. The work will embrace both small scale buoyancy-driven turbulent convection and planetary scale circulations. Idealized numerical simulations, buttressed by theoretical analysis will be employed. Particular emphasis will be put on aspects of exoclimate that are amenable to probing by current observations and improved observational techniques likely to become available in the coming decade. Such properties include cloud properties observable through transit-depth spectra and dayside/nightside temperature and composition contrasts observable through phase curve observations.",False
"Title: SSTEEL - small Scale interlocking mechanisms for Strong and Tough mEtamatEriaL Abstract: Brittleness limits the design and lifetime of some polymeric, metallic, and almost all ceramic materials in both structural and functional engineering applications, from the design of plane engine turbine blades to the newest solid-state electrolyte in batteries. This brittleness is intrinsically present in material composition that cannot plastically deform and make them sensitive to any defect introduced during their fabrication or usage. 
The goal of this project is to produce small Scale interlocking mechanism for Strong and Tough mEtamatEriaL (SSTEEL) that will provide a material independent solution to brittleness. Interlocking mechanisms provide in theory one of the most efficient way to increase toughness by creating crack blocking compressive stresses in response to tensile stresses. Because a brittle material strength is inversely linked to its size, my team and I first objective will be to develop a new process to form interlocking mechanism based on micron-sized elements using a combination of light-based additive manufacturing, shrinking ink design to access sub-printer resolution, and fragmentation. The second objective will be to implement this mechanism at an even smaller scale using rational material selection, solid state chemistry, and colloidal processing to fabricate an interfacial binder for the elements. The fracture process of SSTEEL sample will span several length scales and a specific task will be to use a combination of image correlation and modelling to fully characterise the existing damaging mechanism and inform the improvement of future designs.
These new structures and concepts developed by my group will promote the development of tough structure for today’s and future structural and functional engineering applications by changing any brittle material to become strong, stiff, deformable, and reliable materials.",False

"Title: REACH - Renewable Energy and Connectivity Hub Abstract: Being a world leader in e-learning, e-banking and remote healthcare, EU companies are yet struggle to access the potential market of 1.4 billion off-grid people in developing regions. Off-grid communities in these regions rely on mobile phones for communication and to access essential services such as money transfer, healthcare. Without viable renewable alternatives, off-grid power in developing regions is currently provided through highly unsustainable fossil fuelled methods, and internet connectivity is exceptionally limited. This creates a significant business opportunity for providing reliable, clean and affordable charging for mobile phones and internet access. BuffaloGrid has developed a unique solar power based Hub system and a patent-pending remote payment control mechanism by which mobile phones (or other devices) can be charged under the control of a central server to ensure accountability, transparency and market insights. By combining renewable power and internet connectivity, BuffaloGrid enables EU companies to deliver essential internet-based services (e.g., e-health, e-education, e-governance etc) in developing regions. BuffaloGrid supplies Hubs free to local agents, offering them opportunities to provide mobile charging and internet access to their local communities. This will stimulate local enterprise, encourage entrepreneurship and boost economic development. BuffaloGrid’s unique model of providing the Hub for free, and unlocking access to power, allows demand to be met without charging high fees. Powered by solar energy, BuffaloGrid Hubs are emission-free during use and BuffaloGrid will take back Hubs for upgrade/ remanufacture/recycling at EoL (End-of-Life).

"Title: EuropeWave - Bridging the gap to commercialisation of wave energy technology using pre-commercial procurement Abstract: The global potential to harness the power of ocean waves is huge. Europe has 44% of wave energy patents as well as some of the best resources on its Atlantic coastlines.  Wave energy technology has, however, not yet achieved commercial viability and conventional public technology innovation support schemes have had only limited success.  Convergence/consolidation is needed to deliver the technology the market requires.  Without this, investors and industrial developers will not have the confidence to engage with the sector and help make it a significant contributor to the future low carbon energy mix.

EuropeWave builds on the success of the regionally funded PCP programme known as Wave Energy Scotland (WES), set up in 2014 and expands this concept to the European level as mandated by the SET Plan Implementation Plan for ocean energy.  WES will be the coordinator of the proposed EuropeWave project and lead a ‘Buyers Group’ of public authorities from the UK (Scotland - WES) and the Basque Country (EVE). The consortium is completed by Ocean Energy Europe, the sector’s representative body, who will enable the widest possible engagement with those influential stakeholders able to maximise the environmental, economic and social benefits of wave energy technology for Europe. 

EuropeWave brings together over €22.5m of national, regional and EU funding to provide the boost to Europe’s wave energy innovation community necessary to transition to commercial viability.

"Title: RentalCal - Incentives through Transparency: European Rental Housing Framework for Profitability Calculation of Energetic Retrofitting Investments Abstract: The current level of energy efficiency investments in the rental housing sector is in danger of missing EU policy targets. RentalCal aims to develop models and tools for assessing the commercial viability of energy efficiency retrofitting in the rental housing stock. This will reduce split incentive barriers, price in green added value and show a clear road map towards a sustainable housing stock. In particular, RentalCal seeks to make the following key contributions: 
1. Develop the first commercial viability assessment framework for energy efficiency refurbishments specifically for rental housing 
Although rental housing represents the majority of Europe’s multifamily housing stock, current viability calculation methods for energy efficiency retrofits are geared towards owner occupiers and ignore some inherent characteristics of the specific national rental market such as split incentives, rental regulations, tax regimes etc. RentalCal will develop an innovative standardised methodology for assessing retrofits in the private rental housing sector. 
2. Increase the transparency of investment conditions in the EU housing industry
RentalCal will provide transparent information on the viability of energy efficiency investments based on legal, technical and financial conditions in eight participating member states. The standardised framework will allow for a transparent comparison of investment conditions in the EU, help to remove investment barriers in national housing markets and stimulate cross-border investment activity. 
3. Disseminate key insights into the 'Green Value' proposition to specific target groups 
RentalCal will provide rental property investors with target group specific information regarding the viability of a proposed retrofit investment. This includes the valuation benefits of energy-efficient buildings as well as other indirect financial benefits. All information will be available on RentalCal’s web based calculation and information platform.",False
"Title: BlockStart - Helping SMEs take the first steps into the Blockchain Abstract: BlockStart aims to increase adoption of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) among SMEs, build DLT capacity into Europe’s ecosystem builders and remove obstacles to DLT adoption at the highest level.
BlockStart will match SMEs with high DLT potential (as determined by the BlockStart DLT Assessment Tool) with pioneering DLT developers capable of developing the right solutions for their specific needs. BlockStart mentors these DLT developers through the Engage->Prototype->Pilot acceleration programme with the final objective of testing a DLT solution in real conditions together through pioneering SMEs.
BlockStart achieves this by working together with intermediaries close to the SMEs (e.g.: industry associations, clusters, networks) and building their capacity to run their own DLT support services. Furthermore, BlockStart produces know-how on sector-specific DLT maturity, intermediary capacity and policy recommendations to be used as the basis for workshops and roundtables to discuss sector-wide improvements to the framework conditions for DLT adoption across Europe.
BlockStart is constituted by BRPX, a DLT Company Builder that has bet on these technologies to be the future, CIVT, innovation intermediaries who are building DLT know-how across Europe and F6S, one of the largest platforms in Europe for engaging SMEs and startups into new and exciting opportunities.
By combining these capabilities, BlockStart will demonstrate the potential of DLTs by developing 15 DLT solutions ready to be piloted to 60 SMEs, train over 30 intermediaries on DLT innovation support services, who in turn will reach over 600 SMEs during the duration of the project -  and finally bring together 100 participants to a policy conference - setting the stage to continue the work achieved by the project.",False
"Title: SENTRY - Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Cable Monitoring and Surveying for Offshore Wind Farms providing movement, depth, surface disruption and free-span readings Abstract: Electricity Distribution Services Ltd (EDS) is a global leader in High Voltage (HV) asset management for offshore wind farms.  In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than €60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector. The financial severity of these incidents continues to grow – such that they account for 77% of the total global cost of offshore wind farm losses. Our CableSENTRY is an innovative solution based on Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that detects subsea cable faults in real time. Acoustic signals from the HV cable create an optical response in a fibre optic line so faults and other events can be located accurately and immediately on a calibrated system. Applied in addition to existing fault location technology, our solution will be able to identify fault locations in land and subsea HV cables and save an average of 4 days’ downtime per fault over current methods",True

"Title: CLOVER - Robust Control, State Estimation and Disturbance Compensation for Highly Dynamic Environmental Mechatronic Systems Abstract: The main goal of the CLOVER project is to offer a novel methodology in an environmental mechatronic control system design relying on multidisciplinary knowledge. This methodology should allow aspects to be taken into account, such as controller robustness, indirect measurement of system states and parameters, and disturbances attenuation on the stage of establishing controller architecture. In addition, methods for tuning the control algorithms will be developed and based on the solution of optimization task considering control priorities, such as environment friendliness and energy efficiency.

"Title: UPDWMI - Ultra-low Power Digital circuits for Wireless Medical Implants Abstract: Advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to implant ultra-small electronic sensors in the human body. Interfacing with organs and nervous system, these devices will be a key part of future healthcare technologies. One of the most important components in such a device is the electronic integrated circuit (IC) located right at the signal source. This determines the overall power consumption and size of an implant. However, due to the need for sensitive analog circuits and toxicity concerns, very advanced silicon technology nodes (as in consumer electronics) cannot be used in such ICs. Hence, the power & area consumption is of significant concern. The primary aim of the project is to develop custom, novel ultra-low power digital cells for efficient signal processing and communication circuits for miniature wireless medical implants. This goal fits ideally with the ongoing IMPACT project (in the same group) that aims to develop rice-grain size bio-electronic sensor to monitor cancer tumors. This project will be able to use custom digital cells to optimize this tradeoff between data compression and transmission bandwidth in such a device. The researcher will  interact with a multidisciplinary team working on the IMPACT project,  including IC designers, physicist, biochemist and clinicians. The highly interdisciplinary work will consider the limitations of such an implant in terms of its sensor functionality and physiological acceptance before deriving the electrical specifications. The researcher will bring her extensive experience in designing low-power CMOS arithmetic and memory circuits to this project. This will complement the existing knowhow in bio-sensors and high-performance sensor interfaces already being developed at the host group. She will receive training in multiple aspects of mixed-signal IC design, full-chip characterization and bio-electronic systems. The host organization will also benefit from her teaching and mentoring experiences.",True
"Title: TroPeaCC - Tropical Peatlands and the Carbon Cycle Abstract: Tropical peatlands are the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world and they store the equivalent of ~10 years of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Despite their importance, crucial questions remain about carbon cycling in tropical peatlands and improving understanding is critical as they are at high risk from climate change and drainage for oil palm cultivation.

TroPeaCC will provide a step-change gain in our understanding of tropical peatland functioning and in projecting their response to climate change. PI Gallego-Sala will use her unique background that bridges peatland modelling and observations to deliver a novel interdisciplinary approach to tackle four outstanding questions about tropical peatlands:
Q1: What controls the geographical distribution of peatlands in the tropics? TASK1: To assess the tropical peatland extent using a combination of models 
Q2: How large is the tropical peatland CO2 sink and what are its main climatic drivers? TASK2: To characterize the drivers of carbon accumulation rates in tropical peatlands using the palaeo-archive. 
Q3: How large is the methane flux in tropical peatlands? What are the main controls at the intercontinental scale? TASK3: To determine the main controls on methane fluxes in tropical peatlands, using eddy covariance, chamber-based gas flux measurements, and ground penetrating radar.
Q4: What is the overall carbon balance of tropical peatlands and how will this change in the future? TASK4: To forecast future changes of the extent of tropical peatlands, of the carbon sink and of  methane emissions, using the results of Tasks 1-3 to parameterise and evaluate a global dynamic vegetation model that includes tropical peatlands for the first time.

The interdisciplinary approach will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle, allowing their inclusion in earth system models, and informing management decisions to optimise provision of multiple ecosystem services.",True
"Title: MiRTLE - Next generation, high performance, long range, standoff, concealed threat detection system to protect European citizens and critical infrastructure Abstract: Acts of terrorism aim to instil fear into Europe's citizens. Since 2000, approximately 163,000 people have died from global terrorism. In particular, attacks against citizens and urban soft targets have increased as terrorists exploit the ability of autonomous cells and lone individuals to hit civilian targets such as concerts, markets, shopping malls, airports, transport hubs, sports stadia, cinemas, bars, night clubs and tourist resorts. Recent devastating attacks across Europe clearly illustrate the increasing threat that exists. 

It is impossible to deploy security personnel in sufficient numbers to protect every location. Even if security personnel are present they currently lack the technology to detect, at a safe range, concealed threats such as person borne improvised explosive devices (PBIEDs), guns and knives. There is an urgent and growing need for a cost effective, high performance, long range, concealed threat detection system. 

Radio Physics Solutions Ltd has developed MiRTLE (Millimetre-wave Radar Threat Level Evaluation), the world’s first, high performance, long range (up to 50m), low cost, standoff “concealed threat” detection system for the protection of citizens and critical infrastructure. MiRTLE is capable of screening large groups of people automatically and autonomously, without operator intervention, in real-time. Our highly innovative system detects PBIEDs, guns (including 3D printed) and knives up to a range of 50m in real-time, with targets in motion, all without privacy concerns. 

The overall objective of this project is to successfully refine, scale-up and demonstrate our superior technology to our customer base. We are planning to capture an 8% market share of the improvised explosive devices (IED) and weapon detection market, which will in turn generate cumulative revenues of €161m, cumulative EBITDA of €43m by 2025 and create 302 high skilled jobs in Europe.",True
"Title: PRIMAVERA - PRocess-based climate sIMulation: AdVances in high resolution modelling and European climate Risk Assessment Abstract: The goal of PRIMAVERA is to deliver novel, advanced and well-evaluated high-resolution global climate models (GCMs), capable of simulating and predicting regional climate with unprecedented fidelity, out to 2050. This capability will deliver innovative climate science and a new generation of advanced Earth System Models. Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.
These goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. 
It is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. 
We will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations. These will explicitly resolve key processes such as ocean eddies, and will include new stochastic parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes. These “frontiers” simulations will further our understanding of the robustness of climate projections.",False

The proposed framework enables highly customized cloud-native deployment of private 5G networks. FUDGE-5G will accelerate the (inevitable) shift to a fully software-based 5G core network by offering a disintegrated environment where components, both in control and user plane, can be deployed anywhere as micro-services (i.e., edge, on premises and cloud), being agnostic to the underlying infrastructure. This softwarization exposing 5G NR HW to third parties will enable the usage of off-the-shelf commodity HW to deliver additional cost savings, faster deployments and ultimately greater adoption for private networks.

"Title: Calcivis CAIS - Validation of clinical performance and pre-commercial development of a novel diagnostic for dental caries assessment Abstract: The project will support development of the market ready version of the Calcivis Caries Activity Imaging System (currently in advanced prototype form) and validate its clinical performance against existing standards, which will enable first EU launch within one year of funding and US launch within two.

The Calcivis technology is a highly innovative and globally significant dental diagnostic which has the capability to enable and accelerate the ongoing paradigm shift towards preventive dentistry. Uniquely it uses a recombinant photoprotein marker and a sophisticated imaging device to detect free calcium ions at the tooth surface, to provide diagnostic and prognostic information on the development and progression of caries lesions (tooth decay). 

There is a significant unmet need in dentistry to differentiate early caries lesions that are actively demineralising from those that are less likely to progress to cavitation. Current state of the art is subjective visual/tactile examination which leads to active lesions being missed and inactive lesions being unnecessarily restored. Dental practice is gradually moving towards diagnosis/prevention and away from automatic ‘drill and fill’ approaches; a shift which will be further enabled by the Calcivis System.

It is the only product that can directly detect ongoing demineralisation in the clinic which enables:
- differentiation of active from inactive lesions
- early detection of incipient active lesions
- monitoring of therapeutic effectiveness i.e. ‘switching off’ of activity

To date, a prototype of the Calcivis System has been used to demonstrate proof of concept in extracted teeth and is now undergoing a pilot safety and performance clinical study. The clinical prototype was granted a CE mark in December 2013. The results of this clinical study and ongoing market research are being used to support design of the commercial device and the full clinical validation programme, which is the subject of this application.",False

In this dynamic field, the challenges are always evolving and more stringent in line with market expectation, and socio-economical requirements. 
The chapter of 4G (4th Generation) of mobile systems is finally coming to an end, with waves of 4G systems deployed over Europe and worldwide. 4G systems provide a universal platform for broadband mobile services at any time, any place and anywhere. However, mobile traffic is still growing at an unprecedented rate and the need for more sophisticated broadband services is still further pushing the limits on current standards to provide even tighter integration between wireless technologies and higher speeds. The increase in number of mobile devices and traffic, the change in the nature of service and device, along with the pressure on operation and capital costs, and energy efficiency are all continuously putting stringent limits on the requirement of the design of mobile networks. It is widely accepted that incremental enhancements of current networking paradigm will not achieve or come close to meeting the requirements of networking by 2020 . This has led to the need of a new generation of mobile communications: the so-called 5G. The interests of stakeholders and academic researchers are now focused on 5G paradigm. Although 5G systems are not expected to penetrate the market till 2020, the evolution towards 5G is widely accepted to be the convergence of internet services with existing mobile networking standards leading to the commonly used term “mobile internet” over heterogeneous networks (HetNets), with very high connectivity speeds.

"Title: INVENTION - INnovatiVE cohereNt detecTIon Optical access Networks Abstract: In the called “information age”, digital communications play an essential role on the economy and sustainable growth of the society.  Access networks are essential part of the communication infrastructure as bridge between end-users and core networks. Their design must make possible the provision of real-time high-bandwidth access to Internet, essential for advanced communication services as immersive video and ubiquitous cloud computing. It is clearly foreseen that the only long-term solution to the problem involves optical fiber as transmission medium, the so called optical access networks. Passive optical network (PON) is the most widely employed technology because of the cost reduction it entails, but the capacity of actual time-division multiplexed PONs will be exhausted eventually as more bandwidth-hungry applications become available in the near future. Telecommunications carriers face the challenge of meeting the unprecedented bandwidth demand by end users at the same time the capital and operating expenditures requirements are reduced.

"Title: 5G-RECORDS - 5G key technology enableRs for Emerging media COntent pRoDuction Services Abstract: 5G-RECORDS aims to explore the opportunities which new 5G technology components bring to the professional audio-visual content production. 5G-RECORDS targets the development, integration, validation and demonstration of 5G components for professional media content production, as part of an overall ecosystem representing a subset of 5G network functions. The project will take a business-to-business (B2B) perspective, where 5G becomes part of the audio-visual (AV) infrastructure backbone. The challenge is to use 5G components from previous 5G-PPP projects and earlier R&D investments and further develop them. These components will be evaluated in specific end-to-end 5G infrastructures. In particular, the project will provide three end-to-end 5G infrastructures. This includes the core network (5GC), radio access network (RAN) and end devices. The project aims to use of non-public networks (NPNs) as a way to bring these new components to emerging markets and new market actors. NPNs can be deployed as independent and standalone 5G networks or in conjunction with a public network.
To ensure the successful demonstration of these use cases, the project brings together a set of experienced partners whose expertise covers both 5G and content production value chains. Most of the 5G components will be developed and implemented by a specific key partner, being mostly innovative SMEs. The presence of SMEs is particularly strong in the consortium, since they represent the 44.5%. The 5G-RECORDS implemented technologies will be based on existing 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 specifications, while also prototyping some emerging Rel-17 capabilities.

The emergence of flexible and wearable electronic applications are now posing novel challenges to OWC whereby clothes, mechanically flexible design materials and even the human skin are increasingly being considered as possible supports for multifunctional applications.
Light UP has the ambition to transform the scenario of wearable OWC by developing a conceptually new class of ultrathin and flexible photodetectors with an expected time response as fast as a few tens of picoseconds, greatly surpassing any rivalling present wearable technology. The groundbreaking innovation that will enable this breakthrough will be based on the realization of a so-called “wide quantum well” in high quality atomically thin materials in which the ultrafast formation of a charge dipole upon light absorption will lead to a fast on/off optical modulation of the electrical signal in transistor geometries. Atomically thin materials will be engineered ad hoc by exploiting surface chemistry to heal defect and to exert a superior control over their energy band structure in order to obtain well-suited electronic, optical, and physical properties. 
This ambitious interdisciplinary exploration will thrive on the unique synergy of the complementary expertise and skills by the applicant and host group encompassing nano-chemistry, material science, engineering and physics. Hence, this project will address a forefront research program pioneering (1) the development of a scalable solution-phase scheme for chemical engineering of defect states in atomically thin semiconductors; (2) the implementation of defect-free atomically thin semiconductors in ultrafast photodetector; and (3) the realization of atomically thin ultrafast photodetectors onto technological relevant flexible substrates.",True

"Title: DOGMATiCC - Digestion, OsmoreGulation and Metabolism in fish relevant to AquaculTure and in a Changing Climate Abstract: Rapidly rising CO2 levels threaten aquatic organisms and global food security. It is vital to determine how high CO2 impacts fish in freshwater and marine environments and to elucidate mechanisms limiting performance in the wild and aquaculture. Here, I propose an integrative approach that simultaneously investigates multiple physiological processes to comprehensively evaluate the impacts of combined endogenous (i.e. feeding) and exogenous (i.e. salinity and CO2) factors on fish, and their essential capacity to maintain a constant internal environment (i.e. homeostasis). This will be achieved by investigating cardiovascular, metabolic and homeostatic responses of the economically important rainbow trout to feeding and exercise, in freshwater and seawater, following long-term acclimation to varying levels of CO2 (reflecting climate change and aquaculture scenarios). The project will have far-reaching impact, as it will not only improve predictions of the impacts of climate change on fish, but will also provide aquaculture industry with specific recommendations for achieving maximum growth efficiency and health of farmed fish. The expertise and unique skills I bring concerning in vivo cardiovascular physiology, will be combined with the entirely new and complementary repertoire of advanced skills I will learn from Prof. Wilson (i.e. 33 years experience investigating acid-base, ion and osmotic regulation in fish at levels from the gene to the whole animal) and our collaborators (i.e. mitochondrial bioenergetics analyses and aquaculture industry expertise). This will ensure the successful completion of this ambitious project, and outcomes that are much more than just the sum of their parts. This fellowship will benefit all involved, by ensuring collaboration and knowledge transfer between three European universities, bridging the gap between fundamental science and aquaculture, and providing me with a scientific ‘toolbox’ few researchers currently possess.",False
"Title: INTELLICONT - Development and Manufacturing of Intelligent Lightweight Composite Aircraft Container Abstract: Air cargo has experienced tremendous growth. Essential components and open field of technological advancement are air-cargo containers (ULDs) which have not followed the technological advances of aircraft structures and systems. The faced challenges are: reduce ULD and aircraft weight; enhance container fire/smoke detection and suppression; eliminate permanent moving and locking hardware; enhance flight safety, loading/unloading logistics and maintenance.  The main goal of the proposal is to develop, manufacture and validate a new intelligent lightweight aircraft cargo container with integrated functions for restrain, transportation, fire/smoke suppression, with sensing and wireless monitoring capabilities. The outlined approach entails development of a full composite ULD, manufactured by low cost, high output methods (pultrusion, RTM). Following common certification practice, a building block approach is employed to design and validate the container. A self-moving platform allowing the motion of the ULD inside and outside the aircraft. Low-cost and low-energy sensors in the container track status (ID, location, locking state) and detect critical events, fire/smoke, impacts and accidental misuse. The status of each container will be available to the pilots though a wireless communication network, such that problems would be detected and proper measures would be taken. Lab-scale and full-scale tests are proposed for the validation of the ULD. Obtained numerical and test data will pave the routes to certification and industrialization. The ambition of the project is to provide a major break-through in the state of the art of current ULD technology and aircraft cargo operations. Substantial impact is anticipated on the CleanSky program, the reduction of aircraft payload and weight, safety, maintenance and lean aircraft operation processes.

"Title: NeuroEE - Delineation of a brain circuit regulating energy expenditure to impact body weight Abstract: Obesity is now a global epidemic with a significant and deleterious impact on human health. My career aim is to clarify the neural underpinnings of energy expenditure (EE) given that this makes a significant contribution to body weight. During my early career, I discovered a circuit linking the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducing thermogenic beige (browning) white adipose tissue (WAT), regulating EE. Moreover, I found that the VMH-BAT axis is utilized by estrogen (Cell Metabolism, 2014) and nicotine (Diabetes, 2012) to increase EE and decrease body weight. My preliminary data indicate that a critical node between the VMH and BAT is the raphe pallidus (RPa), a brain region known to drive sympathetic tone to BAT. My immediate career aim is to clarify the neurochemical communicator receiving the VMH-EE related input and transmitting to BAT and browning. Given that the RPa is rich in the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) which plays a role in thermoregulation, I hypothesize that 5-HT is a crucial component of my circuit. I propose to perform a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship (MSC) under Prof Lora Heisler’s supervision, arguably the global leader in 5-HT obesity research. Her laboratory is in the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Aberdeen, an Institute with more than a century of focused state-of-the-art obesity and nutrition research. This will supply an optimal environment for a MSC providing me with the opportunity to broaden my research interests, and allowing me to construct an international network of obesity researchers. A MSC will also provide the opportunity for me to be trained in transferable next generation engineered genetic technology that will allow me to rigorously and definitively test my current research hypothesis and to provide state-of-the-art expertise that will form a platform for my future career.

"Title: AMBER - AMBER - enhAnced Mobile BiomEtRics Abstract: Over recent years the ubiquity of mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets devices has rapidly increased. These devices provide a range of untethered interaction unimaginable a decade previously. With this ability to interact with services and individuals comes the need to accurately authenticate the identity of the person requesting the transaction many of which carry financial/legally-binding instruction. Biometric solutions have also seen increased prominence over the past decade with large-scale implementations in areas such as passport and national ID systems. The adoption of specific biometric sensors by mobile vendors indicates a long-term strategy as a means of authentication. This adoption is is at critical point – users need to be confident of biometrics in terms of usability, privacy and performance; compromise in any one of these categories will lead to mistrust and a reluctance to adopt over and above conventional forms of authentication.

A combined hybrid heat and power plant combines a micro gas turbine (MGT) and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). 
The focus of the technology demonstration plant is to prove the functional capability of the plant concept, followed by detailed characterization and optimization of the integration of both subsystems. The main objective is to move the technology beyond the state of the art to TRL 4.
Electrical efficiencies of more than 60% and total thermal efficiencies of more than 90% are intended to reach at base load conditions. An operational flexibility ranging from 25% to 100% electric power should be achieved. The emission levels should not exceed 10 ppm NOx and 20 ppm CO (at 15% vol. residual oxygen). The system should allow the use of biogas with methane contents varying from 40-75%, thus covering the biogas qualities from the fermentation of the entire biomass feedstock range.
To achieve the objectives the subsystems MGT and SOFC including their subcomponents have to be adjusted and optimized by a multidisciplinary design approach using numerical and experimental measures to ensure a proper balance of plant. In addition an integrated control system has to be developed and implemented to achieve a reliable operation of the coupled subsystems.
A detailed analysis of different European markets, economic and technical constraints in terms of biogas production potentials will clarify the regional suitable sizes and attractive performance conditions of the power plant system. To identify cost reduction potentials a thermo-economic analysis will be performed. Here, an internal rate of return (IRR) of the system of higher than 15% should be achieved over a 20 years.",False

The focus is on civil robots supporting fire brigades in search and rescue missions, e.g. in post-disaster management operations in response to tunnel fires. Existing sensor technology and the related cognitive approaches cannot cope with such demanding conditions. SmokeBot addresses this shortcoming and can thus bring about a step change for robotics. It will deliver software and hardware components which facilitate robot systems to perform under harsh conditions of smoke, dust or fog. This will be demonstrated through integration of the project results in an industrial prototype of a Low Visibility Explorer Robot for providing situational awareness based on a commercial platform from partner TAUR. In close collaboration with TAUR (robotics industry) and end users (FDDO, end users in the advisory group), SmokeBot will crucially improve the abilities of the selected platform, thus increasing safety of rescue staff and European citizens as well as improving the product of a European robotics company in an important market.

In addition to traditional sensors such as LIDAR and cameras, which are affected by smoke or dust, this sensing unit includes also a novel 3D radar camera, a thermal camera, and high-bandwidth gas sensors. Fusion of sensor modalities will allow the inclusion of measurements from LIDAR and camera into the world model when they occasionally penetrate through e.g. smoke. In addition, we will develop the means to integrate prior knowledge in the form of crude human sketch maps to allow for robust mapping and navigation even under low visibility in a harsh environment.

"Title: AYURYOG - Medicine, Immortality, Moksha: Entangled Histories of Yoga, Ayurveda and Alchemy in South Asia Abstract: The project will examine the histories of yoga, ayurveda and rasashastra (Indian alchemy and iatrochemistry) from the tenth century to the present, focussing on the disciplines' health, rejuvenation and longevity practices. The goals of the project are to reveal the entanglements of these historical traditions, and to trace the trajectories of their evolution as components of today's global healthcare and personal development industries.

Our hypothesis is that practices aimed at achieving health, rejuvenation and longevity constitute a key area of exchange between the three disciplines, preparing the grounds for a series of important pharmaceutical and technological innovations and also profoundly influencing the discourses of today's medicalized forms of globalized yoga as well as of contemporary institutionalized forms of ayurveda and rasashastra.

Drawing upon the primary historical sources of each respective tradition as well as on fieldwork data, the research team will explore the shared terminology, praxis and theory of these three disciplines. We will examine why, when and how health, rejuvenation and longevity practices were employed; how each discipline’s discourse and practical applications relates to those of the others; and how past encounters and cross-fertilizations impact on contemporary health-related practices in yogic, ayurvedic and alchemists’ milieus.

The five-year project will be based at the Department of South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies at Vienna University and carried out by an international team of 3 post-doctoral researchers. The research will be grounded in the fields of South Asian studies and social history. An international workshop and an international conference will be organized to present and discuss the research results, which will also be published in peer-reviewed journals, an edited volume, and in individual monographs. A project website will provide open access to all research results.",False
"Title: GEOCOND - Advanced materials and processes to improve performance and cost-efficiency of Shallow Geothermal systems and Underground Thermal Storage Abstract: The 75% of the EU building stock is energy inefficient. Buildings hold a large untapped potential for renewables and energy efficiency in order to decarbonise the EU economy, to ensure security of supply and to provide cost savings to EU households and businesses alike. In this context, Shallow Geothermal Energy Systems (SGES) are a stable, reliable and renewable energy source with some key features compared to many other RES: being available everywhere and being capable of providing not only heating, but also cooling with unparalleled efficiency. Amongst SGES, closed loop systems with vertical Borehole Heat Exchangers enjoy the widest deployment in the EU where the total installed number of GSHP units amounts nowadays to about 1,4 million, representing an installed capacity of about 16.500 MWth. Against this background, there is still a need to remove market barriers and gain competitiveness, but also to develop the next generation of geothermal systems with new materials for penetrating further the market of building construction and renovation. Also the area of District Heating and Cooling needs improved heating and cooling storage technologies which could largely benefit from enhanced Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) technologies. By a smart combination of different material solutions under the umbrella of sophisticated engineering, optimization, testing and on-site validation, GEOCOND will develop solutions to increase the thermal performance of the different subsystems configuring an SGES and UTES. An overall cost reduction of about 25% is the overall aim, leading to a substantial gain in competitiveness. GEOCOND, with a unique consortium of Companies and leading Reseach Institutions in the area of SGES and Materials, will focus on four key development areas in a synergeic and system-wide approach: development of new pipe materials, advanced grouting additives and concepts, advanced Phase Change Materials and system-wide simulation and optimization.",False
"Title: FoodSmartphone - Smartphone analyzers for on-site testing of food quality and safety Abstract: Current food quality and safety testing is, to a large extent, an inefficient, expensive and ineffective process, unable to assure food safety for all consumers and unable to prevent major food fraud incidents. A paradigm shift in quality and safety testing is urgently required in order to free resources for an intensified combat against fraud in the food chain. As an enabling technology solution, the FoodSmartphone ETN proposes the development of smartphone-based (bio)analytical sensing and diagnostics tools for simplified on-site rapid pre-screening of food quality and safety parameters and wireless data transfer to servers of relevant stakeholders. FoodSmartphone comprises 7 Training Sites (3 universities, 3 research centres, 1 innovation SME), plus 5 Partner Organisations (1 global food industry, 1 diagnostics SME and 3 universities awarding doctoral degrees). The consortium has been built upon highly complementary disciplines: (bio)analytical chemists, biologists, physicists, micro-engineers, mathematicians and food chemists will work together on the joint supra-disciplinary goal. FoodSmartphone provides a unique mix of exciting local PhD research covering all aspects of smartphone-based screening tools plus a wealth of network-wide science & innovation and transferable skills training: the ETN provides more than 14 network-wide and transferable skills training events and 16 optional- and 11 mandatory intersectoral secondment opportunities. The ETN and results thereof will be widely disseminated to key stakeholders, embedded in continuous education programs and translated into a final exploitation plan. Scientific awareness of the next generation and public engagement will be boosted by several well-targeted outreach activities. The scientific training in novel smartphone-based sensing technologies plus the complementary skills training provided will have a major impact on future EU monitoring practices and, moreover, pave the road for Citizen Science approaches to food quality and safety testing.",True
"Title: ImpactVision - A new standard for food safety and quality Abstract: ImpactVision is a machine learning company, applying advanced imaging technology to food supply chains in order to improve food quality, generate consistent products and reduce waste. Our software provides insights about the quality of foods and is aimed at food processors, manufacturers, distributors and retailers. For example, our system is able to determine the freshness of fish, the ripeness of avocados or the presence of foreign objects rapidly, non-invasively and at production grade speeds.

Hyperspectral imaging technology captures information our eyes cannot, in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our goal is to provide objective, real-time food quality data to the 30,000+ food processing facilities across the USA and improve efficiency of the global food supply chain. Currently, a third of all food produced is wasted. To illustrate the environmental impact at scale, managing food waste sustainably could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 500 million tonnes - the equivalent of taking all the cars off the road in the European Union. By digitizing food quality control, we improve yields and prevent waste, whilst increasing food companies’ revenues, which is particularly prescient considering the industry has razor thin profit margins.

ImpactVision combines a hyperspectral sensor installed above a conveyor belt with software that analyzes images and provides real time insights about quality.

By pursuing the present feasibility study, the management team aims to improve its understanding of international market conditions and the associated risks that need to be considered as the company develops a deeper business plan for rolling out, and scaling up ImpactVision as a marketable innovative solution. SME Instrument Phase-1 and Phase-2 will be extremely beneficial in helping the company to accelerate development and market penetration of the solution in target segments, boosting the company’s growth to 94 employees and $109M revenues by 2024.",True
"Title: Equal-Life - Early Environmental quality and life-course mental health effects Abstract: EQUAL-LIFE will develop and test combined exposure data using a novel approach to multi-modal exposures and their impact on children’s mental health and development. A combination of birth-cohort data with new sources of data, will provide insight into aspects of physical and social exposures hitherto untapped.  It will do this at different scale levels and timeframes, while accounting for the distribution of exposures in social groups based on gender, ethnicity, social vulnerability. 

Beginning with child development and mental health, a set of theory-based questions is formulated, a wide range of relevant environmental and social hazards is defined and validated at the stakeholders end. Exposure assessment combines traditional GIS-based approaches with omics approaches and new sources of data that could explain aspects of the urban environment at a higher spatial and temporal granularity, and provide insight into untapped parameters relating to exposure (spatial quality of neighborhoods). These together form the early-life exposome. Statistical tools integrate data at different scale levels and times and combine e.g. machine learning, causal models with subgroups measures.  

EQUAL-LIFE uses data from birth-cohorts, longitudinal school data sets and cross-sectional studies (N=>250.000), including data on exposures, biomarkers, mental health and developmental outcomes, in their social context.

EQUAL-LIFE contributes to the development/utilization of the exposome concept by 1) integrating the internal, external and social exposome  2) by studying a distinct set of effects on a child’s development and mental health 3) by characterizing/measuring/modelling the child’s environment at different stages and activity spaces 4) by looking at supportive environments for child development, rather than merely pollutants 5) by combining physical, social indicators with novel biomarkers and using new data sources describing child activity patterns and environments.

"Title: Oncoworm - ONCOWORM: Using functional genomics in highly regenerative flatworms to find novel cancer genes Abstract: This project will take direct action in exploiting the powerful planarian model system to achieve novel insights into the molecular processes underpinning oncogenesis and cancer. Based on the principle that biochemical and physiological functions of many genes are conserved across phyla we will identify planarian genes that control the migration, proliferation and differentiation of the highly proliferative pluripotent adult stem cells (pASCs). We will combine a bespoke specially designed partial irradiation assay, bioinformatic and expression based candidate gene identification and the capacity to perform RNAi based screens of gene function to identify novel genes controlling pASCs that are conserved in humans. Those novel genes of greatest promise will then be studied in mammalian cancer cell lines using the insight gleaned from planarians.

"Title: MicroC - Agent-Based Modelling of Gene Networks to model clonal selection in the tumour microenvironment and predict therapeutic resistance Abstract: The occurrence of therapeutic resistance is a major cause for the small effect on overall survival showed by targeted cancer therapies. Whilst experimental strategies to evaluate available treatments have been faced by an ever increasing number of possible combinations, computational approaches have been challenged by the lack of a framework able to model the multiple interactions encompassed by the three major factors affecting therapeutic resistance: selection of resistant clones, adaptability of gene signalling networks, and a protective and hypoxic tumour microenvironment.

Here I propose a novel modelling framework, Agent-Based Modelling of Gene Networks, which brings together powerful computational modelling techniques and gene networks. This combination allows biological hypotheses to be tested in a controlled stepwise fashion, and it lends itself naturally to model a heterogeneous population of cells acting and evolving in a dynamic microenvironment, which is needed to predict therapeutic resistance and guide effective treatment selection.

Using triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a testing case (15% of breast cancers, lacks validated), I propose to: 

1. Develop a computational model of the TNBC tumour microenvironment using in-vitro and in-vivo, including patient-derived, models and data from clinical samples. 2. Validate the ability of the model to predict driver genes conferring a survival advantage to cancer cells in a hypoxic microenvironment. 3. Predict combinations of druggable targets to tackle TNBC therapeutic resistance. 4. Select most effective drug combinations and validate pre-clinically.

This project will deliver pre-clinically validated drug combinations, new therapeutic targets and a virtual environment to study individual tumours and predict therapeutic resistance. Complementing and empowering experimental models and assays, microC will offer a new powerful tool for diagnosis and therapy.",False
"Title: 5G NORMA - 5G NOvel Radio Multiservice adaptive network Architecture Abstract: ""The key objective of 5G NORMA is to develop a conceptually novel, adaptive and future-proof 5G mobile network architecture. The architecture is enabling unprecedented levels of network customisability, ensuring stringent performance, security, cost and energy requirements to be met; as well as providing an API-driven architectural openness, fuelling economic growth through over-the-top innovation. With 5G NORMA, leading players in the mobile ecosystem aim to underpin Europe’s leadership position in 5G.
Relevant to strands """"Radio network architecture and technologies"""" and """"Convergence beyond last mile"""", the 5G NORMA architecture will provide the necessary adaptability able to efficiently handle the diverse requirements and traffic demand fluctuations resulting from heterogeneous and changing service portfolios. Not following the ‘one system fits all services’ paradigm of current architectures, 5G NORMA will allow for adapting the mechanisms executed for a given service to the specific service requirements, resulting in a novel service- and context-dependent adaptation of network functions paradigm.
The technical approach is based on the innovative concept of adaptive (de)composition and allocation of mobile network functions, which flexibly decomposes the mobile network functions and places the resulting functions in the most appropriate location. By doing so, access and core functions no longer (necessarily) reside in different locations, which is exploited to jointly optimize their operation when possible. The adaptability of the architecture is further strengthened by the innovative software-defined mobile network control and mobile multi-tenancy concepts, and underpinned by corroborating demonstrations.
5G NORMA will ensure economic sustainability of network operation and open opportunities for new players, while leveraging the efficiency of the architecture to do so in a cost- and energy- effective way.""",True
"Title: QAMeleon - Sliceable multi-QAM format SDN-powered transponders and ROADMs Enabling Elastic Optical Networks Abstract: Sustained 2-digit growth in internet traffic is raising the need for new photonic technologies enabling Petabit/s network capacities, whereas suppressed operator margins call for new concepts to make these networks more efficient. QAMeleon aims at a holistic solution towards scaling metro/core networks to the next decade.

At the transponder side, QAMeleon will develop components for 2 generations ahead: Operating at 128 Gbaud, they will bring significant savings in footprint (>13×), energy/bit (10.4×) and cost/bit (>4.3×). At the ROADM side, QAMeleon will develop large-scale flex-grid wavelength-selective switches (1×24 WSS) and transponder aggregators (8×24 TPA), reducing footprint and cost/port by more than 40% and 28% respectively, with energy savings per ROADM node reaching 4×. Addressing the emerging needs of 5G network backhaul and datacenter interconnect (DCI) metro-access networks where dynamicity is pivotal, QAMeleon will develop an integrated flex-grid 1×4 WSS with nanosecond-scale switching time. The fast 1×4 WSS will be scalable to large channel counts (i.e. full C-band) and will enable savings in footprint, energy consumption and cost by 20×, 11.5× and 36% respectively.

"Title: REAL-NET - REAL-time monitoring and mitigation of nonlinear effects in optical NETworks Abstract: The exponential surge in the global data traffic driven by the skyrocketing proliferation of different bandwidth-hungry on-line services, such as: cloud computing, on-demand HD video streams, on-line business analytics and content sharing, sensor networks, machine-to-machine traffic arising from data-centre applications, the Internet of Things, and various other broadband services, brings about the escalating pressure on the speed (capacity) and quality (bit error rate) characteristics of information systems. It is well recognized nowadays that rapidly increasing data rates in the core fibre communication systems are quickly approaching the limits of current transmission technologies, many of which were originally developed for communication over linear (e.g. radio) channels. It is widely accepted that the nonlinear transmission effects in optical fibre represent now a major limiting factor in modern fibre-optic communication systems. Nonlinear properties make optical fibre channels considerably different from wireless and other traditional linear communications channels. There is a clear need for development of radically different methods for coding, transmission, and (pre & post) processing of information that take the nonlinear properties of the optical fibre into account and for training of a new generation of engineers with expertise in: optical communications, nonlinear science methods, digital signal processing (DSP), design of implementable algorithms. From the industry perspectives, design of practical and implementable processing algorithms requires knowledge of ASICs and real world conditions and restrictions. The mutli-national & multi-interdisciplinary REAL-NET project will provide timely doctoral training for 6 PhD students through industry relevant research in the fast growing area of high practical relevance and will lead to development of novel practically implementable disruptive techniques for fibre-optic communications.",True

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies have been envisioned as a key to the successful deployment of next generation networks, which are challenged by many practical constraints, such as spectrum scarcity and dynamical wireless environments. The ATOM project will set an ambitious research agenda to fully exploit the potentials of MIMO technologies for revolutionizing wireless networks. Particularly the overall objective of ATOM is to accelerate the transfer and deployment of research knowledge between European countries and third-country partners in order to provide a framework of advanced MIMO solutions for realizing green, secure and high data throughput wireless communications. The novelty of this project is four-fold. Firstly the project brings together two advanced MIMO technologies, massive MIMO and cloud radio access networks (C-RAN), where a novel heterogeneous network architecture is proposed to boost network capacity by effectively exploiting the advantages of massive MIMO and C-RAN. Secondly a rigorous algorithm-theoretic framework for maximizing energy efficiency is developed for the proposed heterogeneous architecture, where energy harvesting is realized by applying the novel concept, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Thirdly dynamic physical layer conditions in wireless environments are used to develop comprehensive security solutions for implementing keyless secure transmissions as well as key establishment, which will bridge the gap between physical layer security and the conventional cryptography. Finally we will extend the existing wireless network testbed available at the consortium and carry out experimental evaluations for closing the gap between theory and practice.",True

Such reaction was, up to know, economically unfeasible due to a certain number of technological constraints that DEMETO finally solves. 
Coordinated by PROCESSI INNOVATIVI, R&D company of a large EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) group, but supported by a large basis of SMEs that will bring the most innovative aspects of the project technology, DEMETO's Consortium is composed by highly skilled members, which can guarantee the appropriate exploitation of the project business case, also thanks to the involvement of all the major commercial stakeholders of the PET value chain, including the most relevant Customer Segments.
 In fact, having followed all previous steps from lab-level testing (TRL3) to industrial demonstration of the core reactor (TRL6), we are now in the position to further move the technology towards its market deployment, by building a pilot plant (containing a full reactive unit) that would act as industrial demonstration of the performances of DEMETO's de-polymerization approach to the market.
One of the project major strengths is in fact that the market is ready to accept DEMETO's technology. The existing value chain of post-consumer recovery of PET plastic waste is perfectly apt to accept the introduction of a new """"ring of the chain"""", that would close the loop into a circular economy model, acting either at the end of the chain (mechanical recyclers) or at its beginning (PET producers).

"Title: REDOXCYCLE - The molecular interface between cell cycle and redox regulation Abstract: Aberrant cell cycle and redox regulation are hallmarks of cancer. While cell cycle and redox signaling are extensively studied, it remains poorly understood how both communicate in physiological conditions. One reason is the emphasis on oxidative stress as a signature of cancer cells. Only recently, emerging evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) also function as signaling molecules in physiological conditions, and that some of their key targets are cysteine residues on cell cycle proteins. This indicates that more subtle changes in redox signaling can affect proliferation and have the potential to promote cancer. 

I propose to investigate how the cell cycle and redox homeostasis are coupled in a spatial-temporal manner and reveal the differences that distinguish physiological from pathological redox signaling. I will use genetic engineering to label endogenous cell cycle and redox proteins with fluorescent markers. I will measure relative and absolute molecule numbers of cell cycle and redox proteins, relate this to cell cycle and redox states, and determine the cysteines modified on cell cycle proteins. To functionally investigate the pathological potential of identified modifications I will use mammary 3D cell culture – a model that recapitulates many aspects of mammary architecture in vivo and is used to study early steps of breast tumorigenesis.

I expect our work to provide us with a quantitative description of the interface between cell cycle and redox regulation. Although intracellular cell behavior is never completely deterministic, a reasonable quantitative model should be predictive to some degree and reveal how different levels of ROS can affect cell cycle decisions. Shedding light on the cell cycle targets of ROS will indicate the nodes that can be hijacked by cancer cells. Together, this work will provide a significantly improved basis for our understanding of redox signaling in tumorigenesis and indicate new strategies for treatment.",False

"Title: HetScaleNet - Analysis and control of large scale heterogeneous networks: scalability, robustness and fundamental limits Abstract: The proposed research will make a contribution towards the analysis and synthesis of large scale complex networks: fundamental theory will be developed and important applications will be addressed, by extending tools from control theory. Networks are present throughout the physical and biological world, but nowadays they also pervade our societies and everyday lives. Major challenges that will be addressed are:

I. The engineering of large scale heterogeneous networks that are guaranteed to be robust and scalable. 

II. The reverse engineering of biological networks.

A distinctive feature of the networks we would like to engineer, which falls outside more traditional domains in systems and control, is that of scalability, i.e. the ability to guarantee robust stability for an arbitrary interconnection by conditions on only local interactions. The methodologies that will be developed will have a significant impact in various applications where scalability is important, such as data network protocols, group coordination problems and power distribution networks, as they can lead to network designs with guaranteed robustness, thus avoiding conservative schemes with poor performance. The proposed project will also make a contribution towards the reverse engineering of biological networks at the molecular level. Life in the cell is dictated by chance; noise is ubiquitous with its sources ranging from fluctuating environments to intrinsic fluctuations due to the random births and deaths of molecules. The fact that a substantial part of the noise is intrinsic provides a major challenge in control theoretic methodologies. How can feedback be used to suppress these fluctuations, what are the associated tradeoffs and limitations, and how does nature manage to handle these so efficiently? These are questions that will be addressed by developing tools for analyzing known configurations, but more importantly, by deriving fundamental limitations that hold for arbitrary feedback.",True

As the embedded world meets the Internet world there will be an increasing number of interacting systems with strong connectivity utilised in both society and in industry. Platforms4CPS targets the transport, manufacturing, energy and health sectors. Europe is a world leader in the area of time-critical and safety-critical systems and to maintain this position there is a need to be able to design, develop and deploy highly distributed and connected digital technologies. There is a move towards increased autonomy and a need to meet demanding safety, security, power efficiency, performance, size and cost constraints. Underlying this is a need to develop a foundational background to create the “science of systems integration” to manage the complexity of future CPS. Platforms for CPS deployment are also seen as being key for the future, however, these can only become successful if a supporting ecosystem of developers and users is created. Platforms4CPS thus aims to “create the vision, strategy, technology building blocks and supporting ecosystem for future CPS applications” with three key objectives to:

"Title: OPTIMUM - Multi-source Big Data Fusion Driven Proactivity for Intelligent Mobility Abstract: Transportation sector undergoes a considerable transformation as it enters a new landscape where connectivity is seamless and mobility options and related business models are constantly increasing. Modern transportation systems and services have to mitigate problems emerging from complex mobility environments and intensive use of transport networks including excessive CO2 emissions, high congestion levels and reduced quality of life. Due to the saturation of most urban networks, innovative solutions to the above problems need to be underpinned by collecting, processing and broadcasting an abundance of data from various sensors, systems and service providers. Furthermore, such novel transport systems have to foresee situations in near real time and provide the means for proactive decisions, which in turn will deter problems before they even emerge. Our vision is to provide the required interoperability, adaptability and dynamicity in modern transport systems for a proactive and problem-free transportation system. OPTIMUM will establish a largely scalable, distributed architecture for the management and processing of multisource big-data, enabling continuous monitoring of transportation systems needs and proposing proactive decisions and actions in an (semi-) automatic way.

"Title: LightPipe - Antiresonant Hollow Optical Fibres for a Quantum Leap in Data and Optical Power Transmission Abstract: Fibre optics has revolutionised telecommunications, enabled the widespread diffusion of the internet and profoundly impacted industrial manufacturing, metrology, medical endoscopy and structural sensing, to name but a few. In many applications however, fibres are now being operated very close to fundamental physical limits of the glass that forms their core, and this is already providing hard limits, for example, to the maximum data capacity or optical intensity that can be transmitted through them. A transformative new technological step is required to help increasing the information capacity and power delivery capability of optical fibres to keep up with the 1.5dB/year growth in global data traffic and with the 2dB/year raise in laser output power. Air guiding hollow core fibres can provide a natural solution, but the state of the art technology suffers from conceptual physical limitations that bound their minimum loss, maximum information capacity, and transmitted optical power and energy. This proposal addresses these global challenges by developing the ‘ultimate’ hollow core optical fibre technology based on nested antiresonant nodeless fibres. Based on a recent discovery of the PI yet to find experimental demonstration, these fibres exploit antiresonances and multiple coherent reflections from the glass membranes to achieve, unlike any other known air-guiding optical waveguide, simultaneous minimisation of surface scattering and leakage loss. By targeting a 10 times increase in data capacity and power handling and a 5 times reduction in transmission loss as compared to state-of-the-art technology, all in an ultra-low nonlinearity fibre with excellent modal purity and spectral transparency, the outcomes of this project have the potential to revolutionise telecommunications 45 years after the development of ultra-low loss glass optical fibres and to produce a step-change in many industrial and scientific high power laser delivery applications.",True

One such protein is ATRX that harbours an N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) and a C-terminal helicase domain that confers ATPase activity and identifies ATRX as a member of the snf2 family member of chromatin remodellers. ATRX has been shown to localize in vivo with constitutive heterochromatin in pericentromeric regions as well as telomeres where it works in complex with DAXX for the deposition of the Histone3.3. Mutations in the ATRX gene give rise to ATR-X syndrome, a severe X-linked mental retardation syndrome often accompanied by alpha-thalassemia. Mounting evidence links ATRX mutations to cancer and to malignancies that depend on a telomerase-independent pathway of telomere maintenance called the ‘alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway, linking ATRX to aging. Despite these advances however, there is lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism of ATRX and of its role within these pathologies. The proposed research aims to investigate the structural and functional properties of ATRX, and to define at a molecular level how it interacts with DAXX to remodel chromatin. We will use a combination of biophysical techniques like NMR, Isothermal Calorimetry and western blotting to characterize ATRX interaction with partner proteins. X-ray crystallography, Cryo-electron microscopy and Small angle X-ray scattering techniques will be used to elucidate the structure of ATRX complexes. We will also design assays to measure the enzymatic activity of the ATRX snf2 domain by itself and in presence of DNA and/or its interacting partners. These studies will provide insight into a potential new mechanism of chromatin remodelling and will help us elucidate the consequences of disease-related ATRX mutations.",False
"Title: Digital Keys - A groundbreaking smartlock system to increase security and control of entry points Abstract: LEAPIN has developed a new type of access control and unlocking system. Digital Keys is a Software Development Kit that utilises apps and web-based software to set, send, receive and revoke time sensitive one-time use passwords (keys) to provide access anytime anywhere. A secure encrypted technology is used to overcome concern related to fear of hacking and security. The traditional magnetic stripe technology is outdated and the system is subject to regular failures. The installation of innovative smartlocks delivers a more reliable and secure system. LEAPIN’s patented technology allows Digital Keys users to open doors with their smartphones, to self check-in to accommodation/assets with their smartphones, to web check-in to their accommodation/assets, to continue to use keycards linked with Near Field Communications and enable complete self-management of accommodation without human interaction. Digital Keys require no supporting network infrastructure through the use of a one-time password cloud based software. The flexibility of remotely controlling and managing access to properties provides convenient accessibility and does not restrict operating hours. Within the overall project, LEAPIN aims to: implement Near Field Communication technology and Bluetooth Low Energy technology features into the LEAPIN Software Development Kit; undertake at least three pilot trials of the smart lock in hotels in 3 EU countries; undertake a market replicability test of the software platform and its functionality; and establish a sound marketing and commercialization strategy.",True
"Title: SPEED-5G - quality of Service Provision and capacity Expansion through Extended-DSA for 5G Abstract: The objective of SPEED-5G is to research and develop technologies that address the well-known challenges of predicted growth in mobile connections and traffic volume.  A major challenge is the cost of meeting the objective, in terms of both infrastructure and deployment. Today, lack of dynamic control across wireless network resources is leading to unbalanced spectrum loads and a perceived capacity bottleneck. These will be solved by SPEED-5G through eDSA (extended DSA), which is resource management with three degrees of freedom: densification, rationalized traffic allocation over heterogeneous wireless technologies, and better load balancing across available spectrum.
SPEED-5G will investigate indoor and indoor/outdoor scenarios where capacity demands are the highest, but also where the eDSA will be the most effective at exploiting co-operation across technologies and bands. 
The project will focus on two major innovations which are currently missing: resource management techniques across technology ‘silos’, and medium access technologies to address densification in mostly unplanned environments. It will leverage flexible radio approaches expected in 5G (e.g. FBMC). 
SPEED-5G has a very strong consortium, with a mix of operators, industrial partners, SMEs and leading European research institutes. They bring considerable knowledge and technology background to the project in architecture, resource management, protocols, radios, standardization, trials and tests, along with the most advanced of trial facilities, like the 5GIC centre.
The SPEED-5G innovations will be considered in an architectural framework consistent with the 5GPPP. They will be researched, implemented and trialled in SPEED-5G in order to reach high level of maturity and confidence. This will guarantee impact on the 5GPPP program as a whole, on standards and on European technical leadership.",True
"Title: AtlantOS - Optimizing and Enhancing the Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observing System Abstract: The overarching objective of AtlantOS is to achieve a transition from a loosely-coordinated set of existing ocean observing activities to a sustainable, efficient, and fit-for-purpose Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observing System (IAOOS), by defining requirements and systems design, improving the readiness of observing networks and data systems, and engaging stakeholders around the Atlantic; and leaving a legacy and strengthened contribution to the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). AtlantOS will fill existing in-situ observing system gaps and will ensure that data are readily accessible and useable. AtlantOS will demonstrate the utility of integrating in-situ and Earth observing satellite based observations towards informing a wide range of sectors using the Copernicus Marine Monitoring Services and the European Marine Observation and Data Network and connect them with similar activities around the Atlantic.

"Title: ECOLE - Experience-based Computation: Learning to Optimise Abstract: The overall theme of our proposed doctoral programme is ECOLE: Experience-based COmputation: Learning to optimisE. It seeks novel synergies between nature inspired optimisation and machine learning to address new challenges that arise in industry due to the increasing complexity of products, product development and production processes. The unique aspect of ECOLE is to study and capture the notion of experience that is associated with expert engineers, who have worked on complex optimisation tasks for a certain time, in a computational framework composed of machine learning and optimisation strategies. We aim at developing cutting-edge optimisation algorithms that can continuously accumulate experience by learning from development projects both over time and across different problem categories. The more such algorithms are used for different optimisation problems, the better they become since their accumulated experience increases. The Consortium consists of two world-leading universities, the University of Birmingham (UK) and the University of Leiden (The Netherlands), both in the top 150 in the 2016-17 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and two innovative companies, Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH (Germany) in the automotive sector and NEC Europe Ltd (UK) in the ICT sector. All have world-leading research groups with complementary expertise that support ECOLE. ECOLE fills an urgent need in Europe for highly skilled optimisation and machine learning experts who have first-hand industrial experiences allowing sustainable know-how growth for solving future challenges. Its entire training programme is centred around a set of novel research projects proposed for early stage researchers (ESRs), complemented by domain knowledge training, hands-on engineering training and transferable skill training.

"Title: AgriMax - Agri and food  waste valorisation co-ops based on flexible multi-feedstocks biorefinery processing technologies for new high added value applications Abstract: Approximately one third of all food produced globally is wasted every year throughout the whole value chain-from farmers to consumers. To extract the significant amounts of valuable compounds contained in these wastes, AgriMax will combine affordable and flexible processing technologies (ultrasound assisted and solvent extraction, filtration, thermal and enzymatic treatments) for the valorization of side streams from the horticultural culture and food processing industry to be used in a cooperative approach by local stakeholders.
Through the selection of case-scenarios previously developed to a pilot scale by the participating RTOs and their industrial transfer in new applications as food additives, packaging and agricultural materials among others, the project will disclose the holistic potential of four new agro-value chains (residues and by products from the culture and processing of tomato, cereals, olives, potato). Any by-product generated along the production cycle will be valorized in a cascade manner to reach over 40% of high value use of the waste. This will lead to additional production of active ingredients in lower concentration, but also fibres, biogas and fertilizers from the left biomass (the latter with the aim of being used in closed loop in the culture of the crops used in the project to prevent soil impoverishing). An LCA and LCC will also study the best approach to minimize the environmental impact of the new value chains without jeopardizing the cost effectiveness of the operations. The pilot multi-feedstock bio-refinery processes will be validated in two demonstration sites in Spain and Italy. Societal, ethical, safety, techno-feasibility and regulatory aspects will be studied. Last but not least, a business model and platform for communication between the potential raw materials suppliers will be set up to maximize the use of the cooperative treatment plants throughout the year.",False
"Title: LeviTech - Levitated particles as the heart of miniaturized sensing technologies Abstract: The phrase “no moving parts” is misleading; mechanical oscillators are the beating heart of modern technology. Whether it’s the vibration of quartz crystals setting the pace of computation, or surface acoustic wave devices amplifying signals in smartphones, mechanical oscillators are truly ubiquitous.

Micro-Electromechanical Systems, or MEMS devices, dominate research into mechanical devices with technological applications. Due to their ability to be mass fabricated, they have found applications as sensors in industries ranging from healthcare to VR gaming. 
Their sensing performance is ultimately limited by the energy they dissipate during operation, a problem which gets worse with decreasing size. LeviTech proposes a non-obvious and inventive solution: levitation of the mechanical oscillator. By physically untethering from the environment, most energy dissipation pathways are closed, leading to ultra low-dissipation in what we term L-MEMS devices. 

To lay the groundwork for technological exploitation, LeviTech outlines a programme of miniaturization of both optical and electrical trapping technologies, to an intermediate state suitable for state-of-the-art sensing, generation of IP, commercial collaboration, and potential prototyping.

LeviTech will deliver immediate technological application via beyond state-of-the-art pressure sensing, using a highly inventive technique whereby non-linear L-MEMS yields zero-dissipation sensing.",True
"Title: TRR - Exploring Tribal Representation across American Indian-produced radio in US Reservation and Urban Contexts Abstract: This comparative research into tribal radio representation identifies and analyses indigenous communication strategies in American Indian community radio to explore how community radio practices and structures can facilitate meaningful self-representation in contexts where indigenous groups are marginalised. Through this analysis, this research seeks to update understanding of ways in which indigenous radio stations avail of and deploy emergent material developments, including podcasting and streaming technologies alongside ‘low power’ broadcasting. 

Drawing on the inclusive principles of Participatory Action Research (Tacchi et al 2003), research findings will be discussed on-site with tribal communities to share examples of good practice. This collaborative approach will enable tribal members to avail of findings and to provide input into research outcomes in a reciprocal process. Proposed research outputs will span academic, public, and indigenous media contexts in order to widen the benefits of this research for media and sociology scholars, indigenous practitioners, and policymakers.

"Title: MIDAS - Predictive modelling of GPCR druggable allosteric sites Abstract: G protein coupled-receptors (GPCRs) are the most successful class of druggable targets in the human genome with an estimated 30 to 60 % of prescription drugs in European Union. GPCRs biological state can be modulated by small molecule ligands acting on spatially distinct allosteric binding sites (ABSs) that result more selective and less toxic than drugs binding to orthosteric sites. The discovery of lead compounds targeting ABSs is challenging and to date has largely been achieved through cost-intensive and time-consuming high-throughput screening. The recent release of X-ray structures of GPCRs in the complex with allosteric modulators opens new opportunities to develop structure-based computer aided methodologies to identify ABSs.
MIDAS will aim to develop a computational methodology for the search of GPCR ABSs that will include cutting-edge enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation methods in cosolvent mapping. The action will solve several current limitations in cosolvent mapping: probe non-specific binding, protein denaturation, low probe sampling, and membrane distortion. MIDAS firstly develop the methodology in retrospective studies, aiming to identify ABSs in the M2, CRF1, P2Y and GCGR receptors for whom crystal structures complexed with allosteric modulators are available. The computational procedures will be developed for identification of extracellular and intracellular ABSs and ABSs at the interface between GPCR helices and lipids. Next, MIDAS will explore the developed protocols in prospective studies using the M3, µ-opipid and CCR5 receptors with available X-ray structures and known ligands. The action envisions the collaboration with experts from both academia and industry and is set to expand scientific, transferable and collaborative skills of the Experience Researcher. The outcome of the action will foster the development of novel health technologies for the discovery of safer drugs targeting membrane proteins.",False
"Title: MONBASA - MONOLITHIC BATTERIES FOR SPACESHIP APPLICATIONS Abstract: The overall ambition of MONBASA is to develop an energy storage system for small satellites (nano-/microsatellites) that outperforms existing solutions and can be integrated with MEMS technology. To be both, applicable and competitive, the novel solution will have to respond to specific needs, namely:

(1) high energy efficiency and density,
(2) small size and low weight,
(3) high reliability
(4) compliance with existing standards and regulation, and
(5) high cost-efficiency.

Any energy storage system will have to first demonstrate its ability to store energy efficiently, within specific power, lifetime and safety specifications and eventually be available at a cost that is ultimately affordable by the nano/microsatellite sector, which is highly cost-sensitive.

Worldwide nanosatellite sector is continuously growing and three main aspects are driving the development: miniaturization, standardization and cost. However Europe has seriously fallen behind competitors from the US and Asia, with regard to R&D in the field of energy storage, which is one of the crucial components for improving and widening small satellites performance and applications.

With its approach, MONBASA is bridging the gap between R&D and market, with the desired future impact being that the provision of tailored energy solutions becomes a European discipline and business. By bringing together a cross-sector consortium that comprises actors from the areas of energy R&D, processing technologies and space applications, the exact needs of the space industry will be considered for innovative energy storage solutions at low TRL levels. This will not only significantly increase future market uptake of a novel solution that so far is in the state of basic research, but it will foster urgently needed intense knowledge exchange between non-space and space actors for jointly developing novel solutions for a field of expectedly strong growth.",False

"Title: SHEPHERD - Energy-Efficient Activated Sludge Monitoring for Wastewater Treatment Plants Abstract: The aeration of activated sludge accounts for 60% of the running cost of wastewater treatment plants, a staggering 2% of all electricity generated at country-level. The project will improve upon an existing prototype of on-line microbial respirometer with near real-time capability for monitoring the activity of the microbial population (biomass) in activated sludge, and suitable for industrial and municipal wastewater applications, with the following environmental and financial benefits:

• 5% reduction of nitrous oxide emission related to the denitrification process (better process parameters)
• 25 % reduction of energy costs and maintenance costs (better online monitoring of the process)
The solution reduces the costs and improves the reliability of the measurements, allowing small and midsize WWTPs to monitor the biological activity of the process. The integration with existing hardware sensors and SCADA systems, allows the system to control the plant automatically within design operating parameters and reacting in real-time to variable (diurnal and seasonal) loading or toxic events.

"Title: SBS3-5 - Stimulated Brillouin Scattering based RF to Optical Signal Transduction and Amplification Abstract: While the detection of weak signals (down to the single photon level) in the optical frequency range is routine on account of the high photon energy (compared to thermal excitation energy kBT) and the availability of efficient detectors, this is not the case in the radio frequency (RF) and microwave frequency regimes wherein thermal (Johnson) noise in detectors swamps out the faint RF signals (in applications from radio astronomy, MRI to radar) and requires the use of cryogenic amplifiers. The ability to map signals efficiently from the microwave to optical regime becomes paramount for distant systems to communicate with each other using low loss telecom fibers. Both classical (radio over fiber systems) and quantum (linking two superconducting qubit processors in two dilution fridges) information processing systems will benefit greatly from the development of an efficient RF to optical signal transducer.
 I have been developing efficient RF to optical transduction schemes in GaAs cavity optomechanical systems (KC Balram et al., Nature Photonics (2016)) by exploiting its favorable piezoelectric (for coupling RF signals to propagating acoustic waves) and elasto-optic (for engineering strong acousto-optic interactions) properties. In this project, I would like to extend this work and address the issue of weak RF signal detection by up-converting RF signals to the optical domain using integrated Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and shot-noise limited optical detection. Piezoelectric SBS systems can also be used to build high frequency, high gain RF amplifiers with noise figures that can be lower than conventional RF amplifiers. Working in a novel GaAs on insulator platform helps provide some unique advantages (tightly confined acoustic and optical modes with large modal overlap and a large elasto-optic coefficient leading to significant Brillouin gain) while holding the potential for interfacing complex circuitry in a well-established III-V materials platform.",True

"Title: PI3K-in-tolerance - PI3K delta role in dendritic cell antigen processing and presentation to control gut tolerance Abstract: PI3Ks controls important biological processes immunity controlling vesicular trafficking and cell signaling events triggered by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). The engagement of PRRs leading to DC antigen processing and presentation (APP) is essential for the bridge between innate and adaptive immunity.  Thus, DCs are crucial for resistance against pathogens, while concurrently maintaining tolerance to the commensal microbiota and environmental antigens. Crohn’s disease (CD)-like pathology has been documented in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), originating from mutations in genes encoding NADPH oxidase (NOX2) subunits or RAC2 GTPase. Both PRR-activated NOX2 and RAC2 are critical for inducing phagosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) linked to APP processes in the DC. Thus, that dysregulated PRR signalling and NOX2 activity in the DC phagosome, may be key steps involved in some of the pathology observed in CD. The PRR family member NOD2 senses muramyl dipeptide in bacteria. NOD2 was the first susceptibility gene identified for CD and associated with tolerance mechanisms mediating intestinal homeostasis to gut microbiota. Recently, interactions between NOD2 and microbiome were shown to stimulate Treg activity at the mucosal sites. Bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from gut commensal Bacteriodes fragilis induce mucosal tolerance by DC-intrinsic activation of NOD2 and enabling DCs to induce IL10 production from Tregs. It is known that OMVs require NOX2-induced ROS to be released for APP and presented by MHCII to activate CD4 Tregs. Our preliminary data shows that mice inactivated in the kinase domain of PI3K delta spontaneously develop colitis in the presence of an intestinal opportunistic pathogens and show defects in antigen presentation in DCs in vitro. Based on these results, I propose to investigate the DC-intrinsic PI3K role in APP functions that control gut tolerance in this animal model of colitis.",False

"Title: CERESiS - ContaminatEd land Remediation through Energy crops for Soil improvement to liquid biofuel Strategies Abstract: Biofuels are one of few options for decarbonizing transport in the short to medium term. However, they are often criticised for indirect land use change (ILUC), which is critical due to lack of high quality agricultural land and increasing world population. At the same time, significant contaminated land areas remain unused.  
CERESiS aims to provide a win-win sustainable solution to both issues by facilitating land decontamination through phytoremediation, growing energy crops to produce clean biofuels. In the longer term, this will increase the land available for agriculture, while producing non-ILUC biofuel.
The project is based on three pillars. The phytoremediation pillar will identify a range of promising energy crops, focusing on key contaminants worldwide. They will be trialed in North, South, Eastern Europe and Brazil, with samples characterised and converted to biofuels. 
The technological pillar will optimize two clean biofuel conversion technologies, Supercritical Water Gasification & Fast Pyrolysis integrated with novel contaminant separation technologies, focusing on eliminating, stabilising or retrieving the contaminants in an easy to manage form. 
The Decision Support pillar will develop an open access, modular and expandable Decision Support System able to identify optimal solutions for each application. It will incorporate land, phytoremediation, technological, economic, environmental parameters providing critical information to stakeholders & policy makers on the suitability of combinations of phytoremediation strategies and conversion technologies for particular sites, contaminants, environmental restrictions etc. It will include Techno-economic analysis of pathways, LCA & LCC, supply chain optimization, and performance assessment against SDG goals.

"Title: ACCESS2WM - How prior brain states govern access to working memory Abstract: The ability to temporarily maintain and manipulate information in working memory (WM) is critical for adaptive behaviour. Because WM has limited capacity, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that govern selective access to it. I hypothesise that 1) selective access to WM is governed by states of the brain prior to the encoding and retrieval of sensory information (in particular the phase and amplitude of neural oscillations in the different sensory cortices), and that 2) changes in these states provide a common neural substrate through which several cognitive variables affect WM. I will use magneto-encephalography (MEG) to investigate several key aspects of these central hypotheses in healthy human volunteers. This will advance our understanding of the neural and cognitive mechanisms that govern selective access to WM and could ultimately be used to present relevant information when the brain is most susceptible to incorporate this into WM. The project will be carried out at the Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, together with leading scientist in the electrophysiological study of WM (Anna Christina Nobre and Mark Stokes) and the analysis of MEG data (Mark Woolrich). This will allow me to not only perform the proposed research to the highest standard, but also to further develop several key skills (broaden my conceptual horizon, acquire novel analysis techniques, establish long-term collaborations, translate research, etc.) that will further my independence as a researcher and place me in the ideal position to start my own research group within few years after the fellowship.",False

"Title: ExoSonic - A microfluidic chip for non-invasive, early detection of pancreatic cancer – liquid biopsy Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer related mortality and is predicted to be the second leading cause of cancer death by 2030. Widely regarded as a death sentence, the 5-year survival rate is only 3% in the UK and this figure has not changed over the past four decades due to lack of specific therapies and inability to detect it early. Several years often elapses from the beginning of the disease to the patient’s diagnosis, suggesting a window of opportunity for early detection. Recently, tiny nanometre-sized vesicles (exosomes) shed by the tumour in the bloodstream, have emerged as powerful circulating biomarkers possessing extremely high sensitivity and specificity, thus paving the way for a new era of non-invasive cancer diagnostics. However, currently the process of exosome isolation and detection is not only highly inefficient, but also technically challenging and inaccessible to hospital laboratories, clinical facilities and resource-poor settings. 
To address technological constraints of exosome utilisation, we are developing a microfluidic device that leverages cutting-edge microfabrication technology to enable isolation and detection of tumour exosomes from the blood for screening and detecting early-stage pancreatic cancer with unprecedented precision. This chip will have two components, a separation module where exosomes will be isolated from all other blood particles, and a detection chamber that will incorporate technology to achieve ultralow resolution.  The first stage of development will be concerned with the fabrication of all components necessary to harness the sensitivity of the exosome biomarker. Following initial testing, we plan to take steps towards commercialisation of the device.",False
"Title: Q-SORT - QUANTUM SORTER Abstract: Q-SORT introduces a revolutionary concept whereby the TEM is employed as a Quantum Sorter. All TEM techniques are in fact limited to the imaging and energy spectroscopy of the electron wavefunction. Moreover, when a single sample property is sought, most of the image information is useless, a waste that cannot be afforded in dose-sensitive materials. The Quantum Sorter leverages the recently-acquired capacity to structure e-beams, which implies that if, in a quantum experiment (tunable state preparation, interaction, analysis), the analysis is performed over the ‘optimal’ basis of quantum states, very few electrons are necessary for the full characterisation of a sought property, i.e. the TEM can be tuned to answer a single question but with maximum efficiency. To this end, Q-SORT introduces a new parallel analysis strategy, based on a suitable conformal mapping of the wavefunction: the starting point is the analysis of orbital angular momentum (OAM), but building a recipe for diagonalising a wider range of observables is one of the planned Breakthroughs of Q-SORT. This will in turn allow Q-SORT to achieve three other high-risk Breakthroughs of vast applicability: assessing the OAM of plasmonic resonances in select nanoparticles, achieving atomic-resolution magnetic dichroism, identifying different proteins based on selected properties. We believe that the Quantum Sorter will become so important that it will eventually be part of every state-of-the-art TEM, since the new technology is easy to integrate with energy-loss spectrometry. The project consortium includes some of the world leaders in optical and electronic vortex beams, as well as in protein cryoTEM. A major industrial partner in TEM is included, so as to secure market penetration of technological outcomes. The project avails itself of established resource and IPR management techniques. Gender balance and equal opportunities will be ensured. A comprehensive outreach and dissemination strategy is foreseen.",False
"Title: DESIGN-EID - Defect Simulation and Material Growth of III-V Nanostructures- European Industrial Doctorate Program Abstract: In semiconductor technology and applications today, we are increasingly observing a shift from the pure silicon CMOS technology towards hybridisation of function in terms of bringing in sensors, power, memory and photonics functionality on the same chip. In particular, there is a great interest in the heterogeneous and monolithic integration of III-V materials and other complex semiconductors, such as III-Nitrides and SiC on Si substrate. However, the direct growth of III-V materials on silicon inevitably will lead to crystal defects that significantly decreases performance of novel devices. 

To overcome this main technological challenge and to make this new technology financially viable, the most cost-effective and time-effective approach is to combine experimental and simulation work, which indeed is the main aim on this project – DESING-EID. This will be achieved by addressing the following objectives. 

The first objective of DESIGN-EID is to train three young ESRs who will bridge the gap between predictive simulations, experimental materials and device development by developing simulation tools for prediction of crystal growth as a function of process conditions. Secondly, completely eliminating defects in compound semiconductors is likely not achievable, therefore a simulation framework providing an accurate evaluation of their impact on device performance will be essential for designing devices and materials minimizing their impact. Furthermore, semiconductor defects in semiconductors may be exploited for their unique electronic properties if their presence and properties are controlled. For example, vacancies might be used to implement Qu-bits, whereas extended defects, such as dislocations, can provide unique transport properties. Hence, the last objective of the DESIGN-EID project focuses on experimental control and accurate simulation of the impact of defects on electronic and photonic device performance.",False
"Title: LoCo - Low Coordinate Transition Metal Single Molecule Magnets Abstract: The Fellow, Maialen Espinal (MEV) from the University of Bath, outlines a case for support to work alongside the Host, Prof Mike Whittlesey (MKW: University of Bath, UK), on the design of novel two-coordinate complexes of Ni, Co and Fe as single molecule magnets (SMMs).The rationale for the work is the 2013 report by the MKWs group of a cationic Ni(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complex that exhibited the first example of SMM behavior observed in a mononuclear Ni complex. SMMs are the focus of considerable multidisciplinary investigations because of their potential for high-density information storage and quantum computing. Most work until now has focussed on lanthanides, but there has been an increasing realisation that organotransition metal derived SMMs may offer significant benefits in terms of their ability to stabilise different electronic environments as a result of being able to adopt unique coordination geometries. MEVs approach will be to use large ring NHC ligands and probe the influence of ring size, substituents, coordination mode and resulting molecular geometry on magnetic behaviour. The project will utilise the research experience of the applicant in synthetic chemistry to make new compounds in Bath, but most importantly, provide her a unique opportunity to develop new skills for progression of her career by exposure to new techniques and methodologies through periods of secondment to internationally leading laboratories for studies of magnetism (Prof Annie Powell (AKP), Karlsruhe, Germany), paramagnetism via Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (Prof Damien Murphy (DMM), Cardiff, UK) and computational chemistry (Prof Stuart Macgregor (SAM), Heriot-Watt, UK).",False

"Title: LIQUISWITCH - External Control of Liquid Nanofilms for Switchable Friction and Adhesion Abstract: The overall vision of the project is to demonstrate methods for switching friction and adhesion – such as “switch off friction” or “switch on adhesion” – reversibly and with remote control. My hypothesis is that fluids confined to nanofilms between solid objects can be designed to dramatically alter their surface properties under the influence of applied fields, and so can be used to switch friction, lubrication or adhesion in a controlled and reversible way. The emphasis of the project is on creating well-defined model experiments, with high resolution in both film thickness and interaction forces, in order to reach a fundamental understanding of the new concepts and mechanisms involved. The novelty lies in both the newly-proposed mechanisms of switching friction and adhesion interactions, and the new instrumentation constructed to detect and analyse the forces. The new methodologies necessary for these pioneering experiments involve two new versions of a Surface Force Balance (SFB) providing molecular-resolution (0.1nm) control and measurement of interfacial liquid films, controlled application of electric and magnetic fields, and ultra-sensitive measurement of friction and adhesion. Notably, one of these new instruments will have macroscopic graphene electrodes for confinement of liquid nanofilms (0 – 100nm) between atomically smooth electrodes. The wide range of ‘switchable’ liquids studied will include polyelectrolytes, magnetic fluids, ionic liquids and self-assembled systems. Ultimately, this project will change the way we think about surface interactions into something we can ‘switch and control’.",False
"Title: BIONICO - BIOgas membrane reformer for deceNtralIzed hydrogen produCtiOn Abstract: BIONICO will develop, build and demonstrate at a real biogas plant (TRL6) a novel reactor concept integrating H2 production and separation in a single vessel. The hydrogen production capacity will be of 100 kg/day.
By using the novel intensified reactor, direct conversion of biogas to pure hydrogen is achieved in a single step, which results in an increase of the overall efficiency and strong decrease of volumes and auxiliary heat management units. The BIONICO process will demonstrate to achieve an overall efficiency up to 72% thanks to the process intensification. 
In particular, by integrating the separation of hydrogen in situ during the reforming reaction, the methane in the biogas will be converted to hydrogen at a much lower temperature compared with a conventional system, due to the shifting effect on the equilibrium conversion.
The fluidization of the catalyst makes also possible to (i) overcome problems with temperature control (formation of hotspots or too low temperature), (ii) to operate with smaller particles while still maintaining very low pressure drops and (iii) to overcome any concentration polarization issue associated with more conventional fixed bed membrane reactors. Dedicated tests with different biogas composition will be carried out to show the flexibility of the process with respect to the feedstock type.
Compared with any other membrane reactor project in the past, BIONICO will demonstrate the membrane reactor at a much larger scale, so that more than 100 membranes will be implemented in a single fluidized bed membrane reactor, making BIONICO’s
In this way a more easy operation can be carried out so that a stable pure hydrogen production can be achieved. BIONICO project is based upon knowledge and experience directly gained in three granted projects: ReforCELL, FERRET and FluidCELL.",False
"Title: FogProtect - Protecting Sensitive Data in the Computing Continuum Abstract: Cloud computing is transitioning from a few large data centres to a truly decentralized computing paradigm.

"Title: WABCom - Water-to-Air Backscatter Communications Abstract: Over 70% of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, while the majority of the underwater areas are unexplored yet. Owing to growing underwater activities, e.g., undersea oil & gas exploration, and Internet of underwater things, reliable water-to-air wireless communications are urgently needed by the industry, military, and scientific communities. As it is difficult to use a single type of signal, e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), or optical, for communication across a water-air interface, most existing water-to-air communications rely on sonobuoys to relay acoustic signals from underwater transmitters to RF receivers on/above the water surface. The global sonobuoy market is predicted to reach $595.9 million at a 6.62% CAGR over the period 2018-2023. Since sonobuoys might not be recovered from remote, hostile areas of the ocean, battery-powered sonobuoys (which have battery packs full of toxic metals) are posing a great threat to the marine environment. Although energy-harvesting technologies (e.g., photovoltaic, wave action, or seawater based semi-fuel cell) have been developed for sonobuoys to charge onboard energy storage systems, the challenge of miniaturizing and incorporating these technologies into the sonobuoy volume constraint remains a dominant issue. 
This project will develop novel water-to-air backscatter communication (WABCom) technology to enable the design of lightweight, battery-free sonobuoys by leveraging RF backscatter communications, where the RF energy harvested by the sonobuoy from an unmanned aerial vehicle’s (UAV) transmission is used to support the circuit operation at the sonobuoy, and the sonobuoy forwards the received underwater signal to the UAV via an RF backscatter link (i.e., by modulating the signal on the RF waveform reflected back to the UAV). Such miniature battery-free sonobuoys can be flexibly deployed (e.g., air-dropped by UAVs) where and when needed and are disposable with minimum impact on the marine environment.",True
"Title: SOLOMON - Self-Organisation and Learning Online in Mobile Observation Networks Abstract: Smart cameras are embedded devices combining a visual sensor, a processing unit and a communication interface, allowing the processing of images on the device, such that only aggregated information, instead of raw video data, is transmitted. Smart camera networks are typically used for large-scale high value security applications such as person tracking in airports or amusement parks. However, current smart cameras are expensive and have only very limited mobility, acting as a barrier to their wider adoption. The SOLOMON project is driven by the rising demand for rapid-deployment camera networks which can adapt to provide security in the context of unforeseen situations and unfolding scenarios. This is evidenced by the rapid growth of leading body-cam company Edesix Ltd, whose VideoBadge technology is being adopted by police forces worldwide . However, recent research advances in smart camera networks have not yet been realised in dynamic body-worn camera networks, and still rely on prohibitively expensive static hardware. In the SOLOMON project we envision a novel type of lightweight, inexpensive smart camera network suitable for rapid deployment and reconfiguration, where low-cost camera devices such as Edesix’s VideoBadge, are paired with the processing capabilities of smartphones. These are then worn by people (e.g. police, security guards) or mounted on mobile robots. This not only lowers cost, but allows us to introduce a feedback loop between the sensing cameras and the acting people/robots, enabling the camera network to adapt to changes during runtime, for example to prioritise or cover newly relevant areas sufficiently. Novel techniques in collective decision making and self-organisation as well as multi-objective online learning will need to be developed, in order to achieve this vision.",True
"Title: OXYFLUX - Oxygen flux measurements as a new tracer for the carbon and nitrogen cycles in terrestrial ecosystems Abstract: Atmospheric oxygen (O2) measurements have proven to be one of the most powerful tools to study the carbon cycle at global scale, quantifying the carbon dioxide (CO2) sink of terrestrial ecosystems and oceans. At ecosystem level, O2 is closely related to CO2 through photosynthesis and respiration, and is influenced by sources of nitrogen during plant uptake. O2 thus carries valuable information about ecosystem processes that cannot be learned from CO2 alone. However, the potential of O2 measurements at ecosystem level has not been exploited. The major hindrance has been the technical challenges faced to measure atmospheric O2 at ppm level against a background concentration of 21%. Motivated by the enormous insights gained from O2 measurements at global level, and with the assistance of proven experts in O2 measurement, OXYFLUX will provide pioneering breakthroughs in both measurement techniques and scientific
knowledge of terrestrial ecosystems. Specifically, OXYFLUX will perform the methodological, experimental and modelling work needed to develop O2 as a new tracer for carbon and nitrogen cycle processes at ecosystem level. We will establish the first research group worldwide to perform continuous O2 flux measurements at forest and agricultural field sites, using gas exchange chambers and micrometeorological approaches. These measurements will be utilised further in modelling
work where we will integrate O2 into two complementary terrestrial ecosystem models. This will provide the mechanistic understanding for a unique approach to (a) partition CO2 fluxes in e.g. forest ecosystems, (b) improve understanding of the carbon and nitrogen cycle in arable land, and (c) identify the sensitivity of O2 fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems to environmental change. OXYFLUX will firmly establish O2 as a new research tool that can be applied to promote further breakthroughs in a large range of scientific disciplines including environmental, forest and agricultural sciences.",False
"Title: E2COMATION - Life-cycle optimization of industrial energy efficiency by a distributed control and decision-making automation platform Abstract: Improving industrial energy efficiency at European Manufacturing level requires the integration of energy data with advanced optimization techniques to guide a company decision making.

"Title: QSB - Quantum Sensing for Biology Abstract: Modern physics has contributed to the development of powerful instruments and diagnostic tools for biology and medicine, with a direct impact on both our well-being and life expectancy. Today, it is timely to ask if the novel field of quantum information is ready to provide new methods for the life sciences. This proposal makes a step in this direction, introducing non-invasive quantum techniques for experimental biology, with potential applications to biomedical imaging. My goal is to show how quantum correlations (entanglement or discord) can be exploited to realize a fully non-invasive form of spectroscopy, which can be safely applied to fragile materials, such as photo-degradable biological samples (DNA/RNA) or in-vivo human tissues. These objectives are not met in today’s biology labs, where UV-light photometry heavily damages DNA/RNA samples, or in public hospitals, where X-ray scans expose patients to significant radiation doses, with non-negligible risks of cancer. The basic rationale behind the use of quantum correlations relies on their superior capacity to detect small variations in the absorption properties of the materials, even when only a few photons are employed. By exploiting this remarkable feature, I will prove the possibility of non-invasive testing of biological samples. My central task will be the design of a practical model of a quantum-enhanced photometer which is fully based on continuous-variable systems. This design will involve the extension of quantum sensing and metrology to a more advanced double-box formulation where two channels, representing seeded and blank samples, are simultaneously probed. The realization of such a quantum-enhanced instrument would allow for real-time continuous measurements of organic molecules and nucleic acids without any photo-degradation.",False
"Title: 2DMAT4ENERGY - Stimuli-Responsive Two-Dimensional Materials for Renewable Energy Abstract: I will engineer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials with tuneable electrochemical response for exploitation in renewable energy applications. These heterostructures, which are constructed by stacking 2D crystals on top of each other, have been attracting increasing attention in solid-state physics, optoelectronics, and photonics but their full potential in electrochemical applications such as energy storage, conversion, and sensing remains completely unexploited. I will control their electrochemical response by external stimuli including electric field, strain, and illumination. In order to succeed, I will first develop a solid understanding of the unexplored key electrochemical properties of 2D materials and their dependence on these stimuli. I will fully exploit my recent experience in 2D materials’ research and the access to the world-class nanofabrication and characterisation facilities and scientific expertise at Cornell University, the University of Manchester, and National Physical Laboratory.

This research is motivated by the ever-increasing need for reliable sources of renewable energy, which will provide clean and inexpensive electric energy and address the irreversible depletion of fossil fuels. However, the intermittent nature of renewables (day-night, tidal, and weather cycles) does not permit on-demand supply of electricity. Energy conversion and storage technologies, whose majority relies on electrochemical interfaces, balance this ‘demand vs. supply’ mismatch and prevent energy wastage. The topic of my fellowship is in an excellent alignment with the long-term research strategies within the Horizon 2020 and Graphene Flagship EU programmes.

"Title: SENTINEL - Bridging the security, privacy and data protection gap for smaller enterprises in Europe Abstract: Over 25 million European SMEs/MEs, central within EU enterprise policy, face multiple challenges related to personal data protection; ranging from awareness, to a clear and practical roadmap to compliance, the most prominent one is the fact that, unlike larger enterprises, SMEs/MEs lack access to enterprise-grade cybersecurity technology and capacity-building for compliance, making them increasingly often victims of costly data breaches. Although, according to studies, small and micro businesses declare openness to invest in regulatory compliance, including for consultants and technology, millions of European SMEs/MEs still fail to comply with GDPR while their managers are confused about basic data security concepts, like data stewardship, encryption and secure communication.

The 5G-Crosshaul transport network envisioned will consist of high-capacity switches and heterogeneous transmission links (e.g., fibre or wireless optics, high-capacity copper, mmWave) interconnecting Remote Radio Heads, 5GPoAs (e.g., macro and small cells), cloud-processing units (mini data centres), and points-of-presence of the core networks of one or multiple service providers.  This transport network will flexibly interconnect distributed 5G radio access and core network functions, hosted on in-network cloud nodes, through the implementation of: (i) a control infrastructure using a unified, abstract network model for control plane integration (5G-Crosshaul Control Infrastructure, XCI); (ii) a unified data plane encompassing innovative high-capacity transmission technologies and novel deterministic-latency switch architectures (5G-Crosshaul Packet Forwarding Element, XFE).  
Demonstration and validation of the 5G-Crosshaul technology components developed will be integrated into a software-defined flexible and reconfigurable 5G Test-bed in Berlin. Mobility-related 5G-Crosshaul experiments will be performed using Taiwan’s high-speed trains. 5G-Crosshaul KPI targets evaluated will include among others a 20% network capacity increase, latencies <1 ms and 30% TCO reduction.
The 5G-Crosshaul proposal addresses the ICT 14-2014 call of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2014-15 with a special focus on the P7 objectives defined by the 5GPPP IA",True
"Title: MagProtoCell - Magnetic micromachines based on protocell design and engineering Abstract: Protocells are artificial cellular systems exhibiting lifelike properties, which are proposed as a stepping-stone for understanding the origin of life on Earth. Features such as encapsulation, replication, metabolism and selective exchange of chemicals with the environment will enable their use as micromachines in a number of emerging applications (e.g., environment clean-up, clinical diagnosis, drug delivery, remote sensing, bioreactor technology). However, progress in such applications will be enhanced by the synthetic construction of protocells capable of directed movement in fluidic environments in response to external stimuli. To date, motility has been achieved only in a few cases, which involve a response to changes in chemical concentrations (chemotaxis) in the surrounding medium. However, controlling the chemical composition of the local environment is challenging, and thus alternative ways to stimulate motility are needed. In this regard, external magnetic fields (MFs) will enable high levels of control of protocell motility and spatial disposition to be achieved by employing noncontact forces. This is the aim of this proposal: to design and construct synthetic protocells able to sense and respond to external MFs. A key outcome of the work will be the development of a new class of magnetic micromachines based on protocell design and engineering. Such machines will couple MF-directed motility with the temporal and spatial delivery of advanced biomimetic functions. The key factor of the proposed methodology is the inclusion of colloidal magnetic particles at strategic locations in the protocell composition or in the external medium. Thereby, the expertise of the applicant (Dr. Rodríguez Arco) in the field of MF-responsive materials will be applied to the multidisciplinary and cutting-edge field of protocells in which the hosting group at the University of Bristol (under the leadership of Prof. Mann FRS) has made great progress in the last few years.",False
"Title: TRANSNATIONALaw - Transnationalism and Unofficial Law: The Case of Kurds in Turkey and Germany Abstract: The use of multiple legal practices based on diverse normative perceptions increasingly challenges the monopoly of state law. In Europe, this issue has become especially visible in the ongoing discussions about sharia courts. However, there is only limited research about the practical implications of non-state legal orders, particularly in relation to their effects on women’s rights and gender relations. The proposed research aims to start filling this gap by investigating the non-state justice systems operating in Berlin, the city with the largest Kurdish population in Europe, and Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish-dominated city in Turkey. An evidence-based foundation is needed if the legal order and conceptualizations of citizenship are to be fit for increasingly diverse societies. In-depth interviews and participant observation will be used to investigate when, why and how Kurdish communities in Diyarbakır and Berlin choose alternative dispute resolution over the official court procedures provided by the state. There will be a special focus on family cases to examine how gender norms and relations are affected by the use of non-state judicial processes. A historical perspective on the Diyarbakir-based ‘unofficial’ legal order will explore the non-European and non-religious roots of unofficial dispute resolution practices used within Europe. The transnational perspective will also enable an investigation of the mutual influences across non-state and state legal orders in Europe and the Middle East. This interdisciplinary project aims to fill a significant gap in the relevant socio-legal, gender, migration, political academic studies and policy debates within the European Research Area. This proposed project will be hosted by SOAS University of London (Beneficiary) in partnership with Syracuse University (SU) (Partner Organization in TC), New York. There will be additional mobility to the the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Social Anthropology.",False
"Title: CLEAN-HEAT - A highly efficient intelligent industrial microwave heating system based on high power solid state technology Abstract: Magnetrons are the most widely used microwave technology today for both industrial and domestic microwaves. But these systems can only achieve efficiencies of around 45 to 50%, pose safety risks as the use high voltages (5kV) and the magnetrons have a short lifespan requiring frequent replacement. Magnetron technology does not allow for the automatic adjustment of power level to match the load variations. These limitations have a huge cost to industrial microwave processes and there are calls for more efficient solutions.  Across Europe, microwaves consume over 9.6 TWh of electrical energy annually.
F&M seeks to upscale its 200W solid state continuous wave microwave system to address these limitations. The 1kW gallium nitride based microwave system will save at least 25% on electricity consumption, operate at more than 70% efficiency, allow automatic adjustment of power level in response to load variations and significantly reduce equipment size. It will also provide increased lifespan eliminating the need for frequent and costly replacements.  With all these excellent features and performance advantages, our product also comes at a very competitive cost to the user which lies in the same range with the magnetron systems.
Solid state microwave technology can be used in moisture meters, medical applications like RF-Surgery, and microwave ovens for the manufacture of electronic assemblies. It also offers opportunity for automatic power matching that enhances energy efficiency and faster processing speeds. Full adoption of our technology in both domestic and industrial microwave ovens would lead to potential energy savings of 6.74TWh of electrical power across Europe.",True
"Title: COHERENT - Coordinated control and spectrum management for 5G heterogeneous radio access networks Abstract: The exponential growth of mobile traffic, drastically increasing of network complexity, and the strong need for inter-network coordination of wireless network resources call for breakthroughs in control, coordination and flexible spectrum management  in 5G heterogeneous radio access networks. The COHERENT project aims to address these problems by researching, developing and validating a novel control framework for future mobile networks. The key innovation of COHERENT is to develop a unified programmable control framework to coordinate the underlying heterogeneous mobile networks as a whole. The COHERENT control framework has two unique features to deal with the insufficiency of current control solutions for inter-network coordination. First, theories and methods to abstract the low layer network states and behaviors of different underlying mobile networks are developed, which provides a simplified but sufficient abstracted network view for network-wide control and resource coordination. Network abstraction will significantly reduce the signaling overhead, making scalable network-wide control solutions feasible, and enable more flexible spectrum management, which are key for the success of 5G networks. Second, based on the abstracted network view, common interfaces and software-development kits will be developed to enable programmability in controlling and coordinating heterogeneous mobile networks. The programmable control will provide operators a flexible and cost efficient way to implement new control functions and thus to support new services. The innovative impact of the COHERENT project is in enabling a unified control and coordination framework for heterogeneous mobile networks by combining innovative approaches on abstraction of low layers in underlying mobile networks, software defined networking, and flexible spectrum management. COHERENT will build a true proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate the applicability and benefits of its approach.",True

"Title: 5GTANGO - 5G Development and validation platform for global industry-specific network services and Apps Abstract: Telecommunication networks have become a critical infrastructure for economic growth and social prosperity. Current networks will be unable to face the future demands and their increasingly diverse set of services, users, applications and requirements what is forcing network operators to transform them. At the centre of this network transformation is the broad-scale deployment of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). 
5GTANGO puts forth the flexible programmability of 5G networks with i) a NFV-enabled Service Development Kit (SDK), ii) a Store with advanced validation and verification mechanisms for VNFs/Network Services qualification (including 3rd party contributions) and iii) a modular Service Platform in order to bridge the gap between business needs and network operational management systems.  We propose an integrated vendor-independent platform where the outcome of the development kit, that is a packaged NFV forwarding graph, is automatically tested and validated in the Store for their posterior deployment with a customizable orchestrator compatible with common existing Virtual Infrastructure Managers (VIM) and SDN controllers in the market. This end-to-end ecosystem for the agile development and deployment of services realises an extended NFV DevOps model between service developers, telecom operators and vertical industries, increasing operational efficiency, facilitating the implementation and validation of new services and accelerating the adoption of NFV technologies.
5GTANGO system will be demonstrated in two vertical pilots: advanced Manufacturing and immersive Media. 
5GTANGO will actively promote collaboration and try to influence the SDOs most relevant for the project such as ETSI NFV or IETF, as well as the key open source initiatives such as OSM and Open-O.

"Title: GROW - GROW Observatory Abstract: The GROW Observatory (GROW) will create a sustainable citizen platform and community to generate, share and utilise information on land, soil and water resource at a resolution hitherto not previously considered. The vision is to underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting the demands of food production, and to answer a long-standing challenge for space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites. GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge. Citizens contributing data will gain access to the first single-source comprehensive crop and watering advice service for individual and small-scale growers incorporating scientific and crowdsourced information. Moreover, they will develop ‘campaigns’ (coordinated sampling operations) around local needs and issues, to underpin smarter decision-making and implementation of policy objectives. GROW will actively identify and enable new and credible social and business innovation processes, creating potential new services, applications and markets. The outcome will be a central hub of open knowledge and data created and maintained by growers that will be of value to the citizens themselves as well as specialist communities in science, policy and industry.

"Title: PABLO - Power Amplifier Design Through Behavioural Modelling Abstract: 5G base-stations will make use of large antenna arrays (hundreds of elements), potentially with each radiating element fed independently, meaning 1 power amplifier (PA) per element. This situation, combined with the trend of removing the circulator from the PA output for cost and size reasons, the design of the PA needs to take into account for the interaction with the other array elements. As a consequence, the simulation in CAD using traditional transistor models with a large number of internal nodes could become inconvenient, and the use of a behavioral model for the transistor could be an interesting choice.

The project objective is to design 5G RF Doherty PAs for the 5G sub- 6 GHz band using transistor behavioral model. The Cardiff Model will be applied for the first time in a Doherty design, guiding the necessary model changes not only to adapt the model to this application, but also exploiting the advantages that the model can give. Moreover, thanks to his knowledge of Doherty, Jorge will identify a procedure to minimize the number of measurements needed to extract the model. In this way, Jorge will enhance his knowledge by working on behavioral modelling (model extraction, implementation in CAD, and modifications) and waveform measurements. CHFE will improve his range of expertise by hosting a design expert and developing the model for a timely and actual application.

This research program is framed in one of the EU2020 targets, which is the efficient use of energy, as an important issue related to the climate change and energy sustainability of the world.  The expansion and increasing pervasiveness of wireless networks has significantly increased the impact of their power consumption.  By delivering a method to design efficient 5G PAs, PABLO will contribute to green and economically viable 5G systems.",True
"Title: ViSionRF - ViSionRF: Vital Signal Monitoring using Radio-Frequency Technologies – Standard IF-RI Abstract: Dementia is a syndrome in which there is cognitive function deterioration and memory loss. Alzheimer's disease consists or contributes to 60–70% of dementia cases. At present, worldwide around 50 million people have dementia, but nearly 10 million new cases are added every year. The total number of people suffering from dementia is projected to reach 82 million in 2030 and 152 million by 2050 – a 3-fold increase. This puts tremendous pressure on the healthcare system and society as a whole. Equally important, dementia is overwhelming for patients' families and their carers, as they require full-time care and watch. For all these reasons it timely and imperative to develop a low-cost and efficient full-time health monitoring solution.

The goal of this research is to develop an unobtrusive system Suite (ViSionRF) that will be able to capture the vital physiological signals of users (breathing, heart rate, heart beat shape, body position), remotely by using low-power radar, Wi-Fi and RFID signal technologies.  Envision a home with a single remote and unobtrusive device that acts as a stethoscope, heart monitor, irregular breath detector, and posture sensor. Such a home would have the ability to monitor your breathing, your heart (rate and pulse shape), and your position and alert your doctor when an emergency occurs. Such a home would help tremendously impaired citizens (e.g. dementia patients) and their carers.

Unlike traditional patient monitoring systems that require users to ‘wear’ devices and sensors, the proposed system does not require wearing any wearable electronic or on-body sensor. This maximizes mobility and makes the system completely transparent to the user. This is important as dementia sufferers repeatedly forget or decline to ‘wear’ their sensors. The goal will be achieved by developing a hybrid technology that merges Wi-Fi, radar and RFID responses with advanced signal processing algorithms that are further trained using powerful machine learning.",True
"Title: CARDI-ACHE - The cardiovascular consequences of endurance exercise Abstract: Problem: Exercise training represents an attractive and low-cost strategy to improve cardiovascular health. Recent studies, however, report novel evidence that endurance exercise can lead to potentially detrimental cardiac maladaptations. First, acute exercise-induced elevations in cardiac troponin (cTn) levels have been found, which typically reflect myocardial (micro-)damage and are predictive of future cardiovascular events and mortality. Secondly, myocardial fibrosis has been reported in 12–50% of individuals engaged in lifelong exercise training, reflecting scarring of cardiac tissue that is typically found in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These cardiac maladaptations are highly unexpected and largely unexplained in apparently healthy individuals.

CARDI-ACHE: Based on the latest scientific insights, the overall aim of this proposal is to elucidate the clinical importance of exercise-induced cTn elevations and myocardial fibrosis in endurance athletes. Better understanding of the clinical relevance of these adaptations is important to differentiate between the beneficial and the potentially harmful effects of exercise. Accordingly, I will study the following scientifically and clinically relevant questions: 
I. What is the prognostic value of exercise-induced cTn elevations?
II. What are the functional consequences of myocardial fibrosis and are these mediated by lifelong physical activity?
III. Do exercise-induced cTn elevations contribute to the development of myocardial fibrosis?

Relevance for science & candidate. With this project, I will use the most technologically advanced approaches and tools to understand the clinical relevance of potential cardiac maladaptations to exercise training. The studies are performed in a world-renowned research group which allows me to expand my expertise in exercise cardiology using state-of-the-art facilities.",False

"Title: iSCAPE - Improving the Smart Control of Air Pollution in Europe Abstract: The iSCAPE project aims to integrate and advance the control of air quality and carbon emissions in European cities in the context of climate change through the development of sustainable and passive air pollution remediation strategies, policy interventions and behavioural change initiatives. It will tackle the problem of reducing air pollution at target receptors with an innovative SME-led approach, focusing on the use of “Passive Control Systems” in urban spaces. Improvements in air quality, microclimate and behavioural aspects of urban dwellers will be achieved by applying real-world physical interventions on the urban tissue to alter ventilation rates and dispersion patterns in the selected cities assessed for future climate change scenarios and representative of different cultural&life styles in Europe. Through the approach of Living Labs the team will deploy a network of air quality and meteorological sensors (both stationary and mobile) and evaluate through analysis and a suite of up-to-date numerical modelling the benefits expected from the interventions on a neighbourhood and city-wide scale for several aspects ranging from quantification of pollutant concentration to exposure. iSCAPE encapsulates the concept of “smart cities” by promoting the use of low-cost sensors, engaging citizens in the use of alternative solution processes to environmental problems. iSCAPE will support sustainable urban development by promoting the sharing of results with policy-makers and planners using local test-cases, and providing scientific evidence ready-to-use solutions potentially leading to real-time operational interventions.

developed within HIPERDIAS can address other material processing applications, the focus here will be 3D structuring of
silicon at high-speed, precision processing of diamond material and fine cutting of metal for the watch and the medical
industry. Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) approach based on highly efficient compressors gratings will be implemented in

"Title: FINSEC - Integrated Framework for Predictive and Collaborative Security of Financial Infrastructures Abstract: The infrastructures of the financial sector are nowadays more critical, sophisticated and interconnected than ever before, which makes them increasingly vulnerable to security attacks. Despite increased security, most security measures remain fragmented and static i.e. inappropriate for confronting sophisticated and asymmetric attacks. FINSEC is a joint effort of prominent stakeholders in the financial sector and global leaders in physical & IT security, towards introducing a novel standards-based reference architecture (RA) for integrated (cyber & physical) security. The RA will enable timely preparation against attacks, while at the same time facilitating stakeholders’ collaboration for risk assessment/mitigation in the financial supply chain, as a means of confronting complex threats and their cascading effects. 
FINSEC will provide a mature implementation of the RA, based on the enhancement and integration of novel solutions of the partners (eg., Anomaly Detection, AI CCTV Analytics, Risk Assessment Engines, Collaborative Risk Analysis & Management, Compliance), which will be bundled in a toolbox. The RA implementation and the toolbox will be validated through realistic pilots involving stakeholders in the identification, assessment and mitigation of threats. The five pilots involve high-impact scenarios including SWIFT network protection, buildings and ATM networks security, peer-to-peer payments network protection, risk assessment for insurance purposes and securing financial SMEs. 
The pilots will engage >=500 security & finance experts, while providing a representative coverage of the financial services industry (ie. banking, capital management, insurance, card & P2P payments), which is a sound basis for FINSEC’s broader impact. Towards maximum impact, FINSEC will establish an ecosystem of security solutions for the financial sector, which will be supported by the partners’ dense network of sales, marketing, standardization and regulation channels worldwide.",False
"Title: AMPLE - A Study of the Notion of Ampleness in Model Theory and Tits Buildings Abstract: The proposed project AMPLE allocates in the area of mathematical Logic, Model Theory. It aims to develop a full understanding of the notion of ampleness and establish new connections between Model Theory and core mathematics.

Model Theory aims to study and classify mathematical structures according to their THEORIES, that is, the class of all first order logic sentences that are true within them. One of the most important conjectures within Model Theory is Zilber's Trichotomy Conjecture, which suggested a classification of so-called strongly minimal structures - the building bricks of large classes of first order structures. Even though having been refuted quickly after its formulation, this conjecture and its counter example by Hrushovski have shaped the research in model theory and ultimately led Hrushovski to his outstanding proofs of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture, originating in the area of Number Theory. 

The notion of AMPLENESS was developed in order to classify the geometries left out in the Trichotomy Conjecture. Even though studied by many after its introduction, there is a plethora of open questions around this notion, witnessing that a thorough understanding is still missing. Answers to these questions have the potential to reshape the view on the classification of first order structures. The ER managed in her PhD thesis to solve one of the main open problems in this area, by combining tools from the field of TITS BUILDINGS, which was developed to classify simple algebraic groups and groups of Lie type. 

Together with the project Supervisor, who is a leading expert in the area of ampleness, the ER will establish a full understanding of the notion of ampleness, using its close connections to the theory of Tits Buildings. This project promises new bonds between Model Theory and core mathematics as well as a high applicability to longstanding questions within Model Theory itself. It is thus of high visibility and importance to the community.",False
"Title: RECAP - Reliable Capacity Provisioning and Enhanced Remediation for Distributed Cloud Applications Abstract: Large-scale computing systems are today built as distributed systems (for reasons of scale, heterogeneity, cost and energy efficiency) where components and services are distributed and accessed remotely through clients and devices. In some systems, in particular latency-sensitive or high availability systems, components are also placed closer to end-users (in, e.g., radio base stations and other systems on the edge of access networks) in order to increase reliability and reduce latency - a style of computing often referred to as edge or fog computing.
However, while recent years have seen significant advances in system instrumentation as well as data centre energy efficiency and automation, computational resources and network capacity are often provisioned using best effort provisioning models and coarse-grained quality of service (QoS) mechanisms, even in state-of-the-art data centres. These limitations are seen as a major hindrance in the face of the coming evolution of(IoT and the networked society, and have even today manifested in, e.g., a limited cloud adoption of systems with high reliability requirements such as telecommunications infrastructure and emergency services systems.
RECAP goes beyond the current state of the art and develop the next generation of cloud/edge/fog computing capacity provisioning via targeted research advances in cloud infrastructure optimization, simulation and automation. Building on advanced machine learning, optimization and simulation techniques. The overarching result of RECAP is the next generation of agile and optimized cloud computing systems. The outcomes of the project will pave the way for a radically novel concept in the provision of cloud services, where services are instantiated and provisioned close to the users that actually need them by self-configurable cloud computing systems.",True

These contextual elements are presented in the project, providing an interpretation of the main research questions of the topic.: a) The de-carbonisation of coal and carbon intensive regions risks to be a cul de sac of the energy transition process. Along with this process a set of conflicts emerge and move from local to national and European level and vice-versa. One of the main ideas of the project is analysing these conflicts and the negotiation processes related to them, as well as the political cultures and discourses behind these conflicts; b) The challenges facing coal and carbon-intensive regions are studied in the light of the ongoing process at the territorial level. Another main idea of the project is to identifying the factors of de-territorialisation in action in different coal and carbon-intensive regions and to explain their dynamics and interactions; c) The clean energy transition cannot be understood only as a technological change or as an industrial shift, and it is studied as a socio-economic-psychological process affectng the life of local communities. In this respect the project is focused on the study of the coping strategies from a wide array of perspectives: A multidimensional perspective, combining different disciplinary frameworks; a comparative perspective, developing a comprehensive set of case studies; and a multilevel perspective, involving different key players at territorial, regional, national, European and global level.

These characteristics translate into a more efficient power system to boost on-board power and waste less heat. This reduces the burden on the cooling system saving mass and space on the spacecraft, and increasing mission length.

"Title: PeTSoC - Lightweight and Flexible All-Perovskite Triple-junction Solar Cells Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources of the 21st century. For solar cells, the most important aspects for commercialization are power conversion efficiency and cost which can be combined into a €/W metric. Today, over 90% of the global solar industry is comprised of single-junction crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, however, c-Si solar cells have some limitations. The first is their non-mechanically flexible nature and second, their single-junction limit of efficiency which can be surpassed by multijunction technology. Lead-halide perovskites are generating substantial scientific and industrial interest because they are low-cost, highly efficient and bandgap tunable, key criteria for multijunction solar cells. Furthermore, perovskites can be deposited via thermal co-evaporation meaning that the devices in this project, can be made from start-to-finish entirely from industrially attractive vacuum deposition techniques. Unlike conventional c-Si, perovskites are a thin-film technology, which means they can be made into lightweight and flexible solar cells with a high power-to-weight ratio. Thus, they have additional applications for (1) portable electronic devices including smartphones and displays, (2) vehicles, drones and aircraft, (3) wearable textiles, and more. The project draws from two distinct areas of photovoltaics research, specifically lightweight and flexibility with high-efficiency achieved by multijunction technology, allowing it to compete competitively with crystalline silicon in conventional solar energy generation and niche applications. The experienced researcher will be joining StranksLab to build a strong fundamental photophysical understanding of thermally co-evaporated perovskite layers via state-of-the-art spectroscopy tools to target the development of a lightweight and flexible all-perovskite triple-junction solar cell with an efficiency >30%.",True

The validation of the latest available railway-relevant 5G specifications will be achieved through cross-border emulation trials covering significant portions of railway operational communication requirements and including the core technological innovations for rail expected from 5G release 16 and pre-release 17.

The project will first define functional tests and then work towards the development and evaluation of prototypes, for both on-board and infrastructure, including vital (ETCS, ATO) and essential (voice specific services, TCMS and video) applications. Prototypes will be then tested in simulated and real environments, with pilots in labs and in the field rolled out in various European sites (France, Hungary and Germany), to ensure compliancy and validation for FRMCS specifications, standards and performance, and consequently guarantee the time to market for FRMCS deployments, planned for 2025 as per European timeline.

5GRAIL will finally deliver test report conclusions to potentially update FRMCS V1 specifications and to identify technical constraints related to implementation issues.",True
"Title: SALSA - Small farms, small food businesses and sustainable food security Abstract: SALSA will assess the role of small farms and small food businesses in delivering a sustainable and secure supply of affordable, nutritious and culturally adequate food. SALSA will identify the mechanisms which, at different scales, can strengthen the role of small farms in food systems and thereby support sustainable food and nutrition security (FNS). By considering a gradient of 30 reference regions in Europe and in Africa, we will obtain a differentiated understanding of the role of small farms and small food businesses in very differently structured food systems and situations. 
SALSA will elaborate and implement a transdisciplinary, multi-scale approach that builds on and connects relevant theoretical and analytical frameworks within a food systems approach, and that uses qualitative, consultative and quantitative methods. We will also test a new combination of data-based methods and tools (including satellite technologies) for rigorously assessing in quantitative terms the interrelationships between small farms, other small food businesses and FNS, paying particular attention to limiting and enabling factors. SALSA will use participatory methods, at regional level, and establish a more global Community of Practice and multi-stakeholder learning platform, based on FAO’s TECA online communication and learning platform.
The SALSA consortium, and the joint learning and close cooperation, have both been designed with the EU - Africa dialogue in mind. Responding to the call we will unravel the complex interrelationships between small farms, small food businesses and FNS, and unfold the role played by small farms in (a) the balance between the different dimensions of sustainability, (b) maintaining more diverse production systems, (c) supporting the urban/rural balance in terms of labour and (d) in facilitating territorial development in countries facing a strong rural population growth.",False
"Title: MorSR - Integrating morpho-phonology in speech recognition Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is considered to represent the most natural man-machine interface across the spectrum of technological space. Current commercial ASR systems rely on a ‘rich’ representation of an acoustic signal for words and their variants, resulting in major challenges in the deployment of ASR systems in areas where it could have substantial social impact. Our central goal is to translate research results from the ERC funded project MORPHON into a novel ASR system to remove such barriers. We have previously demonstrated that the use of a universal set of phonological features delivers an isolated word recognition system (FlexSR) with enhanced phoneme recognition accuracy. It is more robust under conditions of non-standard speech, dialect variation and can be easily adapted to new languages. These aspects are problematic for current ASR systems which rely on the probabilistic sequencing of whole words in their language model (LM) based on large written text corpora for training. Obtaining sufficient training data for a new LM is prohibitively expensive. Instead, MorSR will incorporate linguistic information about word-structure to reject improbable words. This reduces the search space and increases the probability of identifying correct words. A major outcome will be an innovative LM based on linguistic principles. Unlike existing approaches, it is based on speech data to capture crucial regularities that are lost in text corpora. Combined with FlexSR's key strengths in identifying subtle phonological contrasts, MorSR will not only enable improved predictions of word sequences in running speech, but also dramatically reduce the requirement for training data when adapting the system to a new language. MorSR's strengths include: (a) prediction of fine-grained possibilities of word sequences based on grammatical principles; (b) requiring considerably less training data; (c) easily adaptable to new languages; and (d) will be fast, secure and accurate.",False
"Title: SESAME - Small cEllS coordinAtion  for Multi-tenancy and  Edge services Abstract: SESAME targets innovations around three central elements in 5G: the placement of network intelligence and applications in the network edge through Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) and Edge Cloud Computing; the substantial evolution of the Small Cell concept, already mainstream in 4G but expected to deliver its full potential in the challenging high dense 5G scenarios; and the consolidation of multi-tenancy in communications infrastructures, allowing several operators/service providers to engage in new sharing models of both access capacity and edge computing capabilities. 

SESAME proposes the Cloud-Enabled Small Cell (CESC) concept, a new multi-operator enabled Small Cell that integrates a virtualised execution platform (i.e., the Light DC) for deploying Virtual Network Functions (NVFs), supporting powerful self-x management and executing novel applications and services inside the access network infrastructure. The Light DC will feature low-power processors and hardware accelerators for time critical operations and will build a high manageable clustered edge computing infrastructure. This approach will allow new stakeholders to dynamically enter the value chain by acting as 'host-neutral' providers in high traffic areas where densification of multiple networks is not practical. The optimal management of a CESC deployment is a key challenge of SESAME, for which new orchestration, NFV management, virtualisation of management views per tenant, self-x features and radio access management techniques will be developed.
 
After designing, specifying and developing the architecture and all the involved CESC modules, SESAME will culminate with a prototype with all functionalities for proving the concept in relevant use cases. Besides, CESC will be formulated consistently and synergistically with other 5G-PPP components through coordination with the corresponding projects.",True
"Title: TURBO-REFLEX - TURBOmachinery REtrofits enabling FLEXible back-up capacity for the transition of the European energy system Abstract: The energy sector accounts for two thirds of the global CO2 emissions and is therefore crucial to ensure future green growth and to achieve the global emission reduction targets. Substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can only be achieved by large scale deployment of renewable energy sources, including in particular the most abundant energy sources, wind and sun. Their intermittent nature however poses significant challenges for the energy system as peak demand from the system and peak production form those intermittent sources do not overlap. As there are no large scale storage solutions available yet, other backup capacities are needed. The installed fossil capacity is large enough to provide this back-up power. However, the plants were designed for baseload operation, which results in increased wear and costs through cyclic operation and unnecessarily high emissions in the start-up phase.
Providing technology upgrades to retrofit the installed power plants to enable flexible operation without penalties on life, cost and emissions is an opportunity to quickly provide the necessary backup capacity to keep the energy system stable and resilient and at the same time enabling higher renewable shares.
TURBO-REFLEX will follow this approach and has selected technologies for retrofitting critical parts of thermal power plants which have already seen experimental proof-of-concept and are expected to significantly contribute to flexible operation. The technologies will reduce the minimum load, increase the ramp rates and reduce the costs per cycle. This will be achieved by new compressor designs for off-design operability, technologies in the hot gas path, in combustor and turbine, and by new materials, models and sensors to monitor and ensure the mechanical integrity in flexible operation. An integrated assessment will provide not only the technological but also the economic benefits for plant operators, thus ensuring a swift implementation of TURBO-REFLEX technologies.",False
"Title: SENF - Selective Electrochemical Nucleophilic Fluorination Abstract: The incorporation of fluorine into organic compounds is extremely important for designing molecules with specific function. Fluorine is primed for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs and agrochemicals, and is crucial for the life-changing imaging technique, Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Thus, selective fluorination is an area of significant interest in organic synthesis.

This research programme will develop a concept that promises to revolutionise fluorination chemistry. While nucleophilic fluoride (F-) sources are inexpensive and readily available, they have unfavourable reactivity compared to electrophilic fluorine sources (F+), which are typically expensive, wasteful and not suited to either large scale synthesis or PET. By transmuting F- into F+, we can get the best of both worlds! We will develop a concept based on umpolung (polarity reversal) to invent a number of novel synthetic methodologies or to expand useful reactions into new chemical space. The overall vision is to create new pathways to new bioactive molecules that are either more potent, have improved pharmacokinetics, or can be new radiochemical tracers.

Our strategy relies on the combination of catalysis and electrochemical oxidation to perform this thermodynamically demanding task. The use of electrochemistry is essential for this strategy, because it is necessary to be able to ‘dial-in’ any oxidising potential with high control. New organo- and organometallic catalysts, heterogeneous electrocatalysts and fluoride sources will be developed as part of the studies, which will be of value to the fields of fluorination, homogeneous catalysis, synthesis and energy research. Medicinal, process and radio chemists will all benefit as their toolbox of methods will expand, thereby facilitating the discovery and manufacture of drugs and chemicals that improve the quality of human life around the globe.",False
"Title: ANCESTORS - Making Ancestors: The Politics of Death in Prehistoric Europe Abstract: How did politics and inequality work in prehistoric Europe? Traditionally, politics has been seen in terms of discrete political ranks identified through differential treatment of individual burials. But this results in classifying much of prehistory, where the dead were treated in ways which effaced individual identity, as egalitarian. The result is an artificially dichotomous history: Neolithic people had landscapes, rituals and ancestors, Bronze and Iron Age people had politics and inequality. In the last two decades this approach has been strongly critiqued. Burial treatment rarely relates to status so directly; the dead serve many different political roles. Inequality in pre-state groups rarely consists of clear strata; inequality and equality exist in tension within groups. Inequality may have been present throughout European prehistory, but manifest situationally through differential life chances, kinship, ritual or ancestorhood, rather than overtly through political command, wealth or identity. But this new perspective has never been tested empirically.
	This project tests alternative models of prehistoric inequality and deathways. To investigate social relations in life, it uses osteobiography, reconstructing life stories from skeletons through scientific data on identity, health, diet, mobility and kinship. To understand deathways, it employs a second new methodology, funerary taphonomy. Combining osteobiography and taphonomy allows us to connect ancient lives and deaths. Peninsular Italy provides a substantial test sequence typical of much of Europe. For each of three key periods (Neolithic, 6000-4000 BC; Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, 4000-1800 BC; Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age, 1800-600 BC), 200+ individuals will be analysed. The results will allow us to evaluate for the first time how inequality affected lives in prehistoric Europe and what role ancestors played in it.",False
"Title: DNAmics - DNA mimetics: Synthetic molecular duplexes Abstract: Precise control of macroscopic properties at molecular level is one of the biggest challenges of modern science. Nature accomplishes this by adding information to matter, and organizes chemical system of nonliving components into living, biological systems. Inspired by the most fascinating nature’s information system, the DNA, and using its basic structural elements, modular and highly flexible synthesis of novel chemical information carrying system will be performed. This will enable the preparation of the desired sequence of H-bonding recognition sites. The prepared short oligomeric sequences will be used to explore robustness of synthetic sequences for the formation of duplexes. By quantitative assessment of multivalent recognition of complementary sequences and imperfections in the duplex formation of non-complementary and defective sequences, valuable information on the structural features and fidelity of supramolecular assembly formation of various sequences will be obtained. This will give insight into reliability and predictability, in other words programmability, of the proposed synthetic recognition sequences to form molecular duplexes. Reliable formation of synthetic duplexes would allow precise control over supramolecular interactions and will lay the foundation for formation of smart advanced materials with unprecedented mechanical, electronic and photochemical properties.",False
"Title: RISEN - Rail Infrastructure Systems Engineering Network Abstract: Social and economic growth, security and sustainability in Europe are at risk of being compromised due to aging and failing railway infrastructure systems. This partly reflects a recognised skill shortage in railway infrastructure engineering. This project, RISEN, aims to enhance knowledge creation and transfer using both international and intersectoral secondment mechanisms among European Advanced Rail Research Universities/SMEs and Non-EU, world-class rail universities including the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (USA), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA), Southwest Jiaotong University (China), Tsinghua University (China), University of California Berkeley (USA), Railway Technical Research Institute (Japan), University of Sao Paulo (Brazil), Iranian University of Science and Technology (Iran), Chulalongkorn University (Thailand), and University of Wollongong (Australia). This project adds research skill mobility and innovation dimension to existing bilateral collaborations between universities through research exchange, joint research supervision, summer courses, international training and workshops, and joint development of innovative inventions. It spans over 4 years from April 2016 to March 2020. 

RISEN aims to produce the next generation of engineers and scientists needed to meet the challenge of providing sustainable, smart and resilient railway infrastructure systems critical for maintaining European competitiveness. The emphasis will be placed on the resilience and adaptation of railway and urban transport infrastructures using integrated smart systems. Such critical areas of the research theme will thus be synergised to improve response and resilience of rail infrastructure systems to climate change, extreme events from natural and human-made hazards, and future operational demands.

"Title: ULTRACONTROL - Ultra-low cost orbit transfer and orbit control for future libration point missions Abstract: The key objective of this ambitious and adventurous program of research is to develop an entirely new method of spacecraft orbit transfer and orbit control using solar sails, driven only by solar radiation pressure. The new method will enable ultra-low cost libration point missions, with numerous applications in space science, Earth observation and telecommunications.

To achieve this goal, orbit transfer and orbit control for such libration point missions will be investigated using modern dynamical system theory with solar radiation pressure. This provides a key advantage over conventional thrusters, since a solar sail does not require propellant, thus reducing spacecraft mass and launch costs while significantly lengthening mission
duration. Through this programme of research, practical control strategies will be evaluated and engineering requirements
on solar sail size and performance assessed.

The programme of research will be supported by the interdisciplinary Space Glasgow Research Cluster and the host’s extensive network of international collaborators on solar sailing (ESA, NASA, NOAA). The host supervisor is the acknowledged international leader in the rapidly developing field of solar sailing. The therefore project offers a golden
opportunity to link the Experienced Research’s prior work on real-world solar sail mission operations at the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) with the host’s extensive expertise in solar sail orbital dynamics.",True
"Title: LANDSENSE - A Citizen Observatory and Innovation Marketplace for Land Use and Land Cover Monitoring Abstract: Currently within the EU’s Earth Observation (EO) monitoring framework, there is a need for low-cost methods for acquiring high quality in-situ data to create accurate and well-validated environmental monitoring products. The aim of the LandSense project is to build a far reaching citizen observatory for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) monitoring that will also function as a technology innovation marketplace. LandSense will deploy advanced tools, services and resources to mobilize and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. New LandSense services (LandSense Campaigner, FarmLand Support, Change Detector and Quality Assurance & Control) will be deployed in three demonstration cases that will address critical LULC issues in the areas of urbanization, agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring. Policy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. There will be numerous pathways to citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform, i.e. tools for discussion, online voting collaborative mapping, as well as events linked to various campaigns involving public consultation.

"Title: 5G-CLARITY - Beyond 5G multi-tenant private networks integrating Cellular, WiFi, and LiFi, Powered by ARtificial Intelligence and Intent Based PolicY Abstract: The first generation of 5G networks launching commercially in 2019 will focus on the eMBB service for the retail sector. Thus, public 5G networks will not be able to address, in the short term, the promise of novel critical communication services required by vertical users. Private 5G and beyond 5G networks are seen as a promising way to bridge this gap, allowing private venues to deploy the required 5G capabilities early on. Factories and private venues, like stadiums or transportation hubs, are seen as key early adopters of these technologies.
5G-CLARITY puts forward a beyond 5G architecture for private networks, which features a novel access network integrating 5G, WiFi, and LiFi, compute and transport resources, and novel management components to enable AI driven network automation. Based on this architecture, 5G-CLARITY will define communication services that deliver measurable enhancements with respect to the eMBB and URLLC services defined by 3GPP in Release 16, in terms of low latency, area capacity, reliability, and accurate positioning and synchronization capabilities. In addition, 5G-CLARITY will develop a management plane featuring SDN/NFV components together with an AI engine that will automate network management by receiving high level intent policies from the network administrator.
5G-CLARITY brings together an ambitious consortium that ensures the delivery of the project innovations to standard bodies, where 3GPP, O-RAN, IEEE802.11bb, and ETSI-ZSM, have already been identified as preferential targets. Finally, the 5G-CLARITY technology will be demonstrated in two relevant use cases, including a human-robot interaction application in a museum in Bristol, and a network slicing and AGV positioning application for Industry 4.0 services in a factory near Barcelona. Potential for individual and joint exploitation of the project results has already been identified during the proposal preparation phase.",True
"Title: Mendel KBASE - Developing Natural Language Processing and machine learning algorithms for the most comprehensive knowledge base to speed up diagnosis of rare disease patients Abstract: Collectively, rare diseases affect the lives of an estimated 30 million people across the European Union. The majority of rare diseases have a genetic origin, are chronic, highly disabling and life threatening. As a consequence, rare diseases pose a substantial medical burden for patients and an economic burden for society and healthcare systems. Correct diagnosis is highly challenging due to the rarity and sheer number of rare diseases. As a result, it takes an average of five to six years for patients to get their definitive diagnosis which can lead to serious consequences for their health. 

Mendelian is an innovative start-up with a mission to speed up diagnosis of rare disease patients by developing intelligent clinical decision support tools. For this, we have launched Mendelian’s search engine where medical professionals receive a ranked list of rare diseases and causative genes based on a patient’s symptoms entered. Building on the technology and knowledge gained during the development of Mendelian’s prototype search engine, we now aim to develop a highly detailed and comprehensive rare disease knowledge base that will improve the accuracy of our search engine and support the development of an automated scanning platform. For this, Mendelian is searching for a highly specialised PhD with expertise in state of the art methods in clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) so that features that are useful for diagnosis can be extracted and processed from medical literature and electronic health records in an automated fashion. Developing a comprehensive rare disease knowledge base in house is highly challenging but would have huge benefits by providing us with the flexibility to adjust and optimize NLP pipelines to optimally meet the needs of the physicians using our tools. With EU support, Mendelian can widen its recruitment market from the UK to EU, increase its visibility and offer the innovation associate a competitive salary.",False
"Title: myAirCoach - Analysis, modelling and sensing of both physiological and environmental factors for the customized and predictive self-management of Asthma Abstract: ""myAirCoach aims to develop a holistic mHealth personalised asthma monitoring system empowering patients to manage their own health by providing user friendly tools to increase the awareness of their clinical state and effectiveness of medical treatment. This will be achieved through a multi-disciplinary approach aiming at the development of an ergonomic, compact and efficient sensor-based inhaler that will be in continuous communication with a mobile device. This sensing infrastructure will have the capability of automated monitoring of several clinical, behavioural and environmental factors in realistic conditions. A pipeline of advanced analysis, processing and computational modelling techniques, dealing with raw measurements, extracted features, indicators, and personal profile data representation will ensure clinical state awareness and a timely optimal treatment. Besides, a """"personal mHealth guidance system"""" will empower patients to customize their treatment towards personalised preset goals and guidelines, either automatically or driven by healthcare professional in a telemedicine manner. In this context, myAirCoach will give to clinicians early indications of increasing symptoms or exacerbations, while making an important contribution in successfully self-management of asthma. The myAirCoach framework will be quantified and evaluated in two test campaigns with carefully designed cohorts of patients in three testing sites. Besides the obvious necessity of the test campaigns to ground the myAirCoach patient models and framework with data, the objective formal validation of the results is expected to lead to increased confidence in the myAirCoach approach and in ICT decision support and self-management systems in general. The impact of such a holistic and innovative approach is huge and the foundations laid here are expected to result in a widespread adoption of sensor-based self-management systems not only in asthma, but also in other respiratory diseases.

"Title: SPECTRUM - Spectral theory of random operators Abstract: The theme of this proposal is the study of random operators associated with some geometric structure, and the influence of the geometry on the spectral properties of the operator. Such operators appear in problems from theoretical physics, and lead to new and interesting mathematical structures.
One circle of questions is related to random operators, which describe the motion of a quantum particle in a disordered medium, such as random band matrices. The behaviour of the particle is influenced by the underlying geometry, as quantified by the (non-rigorous) Thouless criterion for localisation in terms of the mixing time of the classical random walk; in the context of random band matrices, the predictions of the Thouless criterion are supported by additional (non-rigorous) arguments. These predictions have so far not been rigorously justified; an exception is my own result, validating it at the spectral edges. One of our goals is to develop new methods, which would be applicable in the bulk of the spectrum, for random band matrices and other operators with geometric structure.
Another circle of questions is given by random processes taking values in large random matrices. The spectral properties of the random matrix at every point of the underlying space are described by the random matrix theory; but how does the spectrum evolve along the underlying space? The richness of this question is apparent from the one-dimensional case of Dyson Brownian motion. We intend to study the local eigenvalue statistics of general matrix-valued random processes with multi-dimensional underlying space; to give a complete description of the random processes which appear in the limit, first for the spectral edges and then for the bulk of the spectrum, and to explore the appearance of these processes in a variety of basic questions of mathematical physics.",False

Thus they are a primary target for criminals having a multiplier effect on the power of attacks and providing enormous resonance and gains. Also extreme weather events and natural disasters represents a challenge due to their increase in frequency and intensity requiring smarter resilience of the Communication CIs, which are extremely vulnerable due to the ever-increasing complexity of the architecture also in light of the evolution towards 5G, the extensive use of programmable platforms and exponential growth of connected devices. The fact that most enterprises still manage physical and cyber security independently represents a further challenge. 
RESISTO platform is an innovative solution for Communication CIs holistic situation awareness and enhanced resilience (aligned with ECSO objectives).

"Title: MICROMIX-ECO-2015 - Innovative active-uptake foliar nutrition technology capable of significantly reducing pesticide rates Abstract: Crop protection measures are essential to prevent or reduce the productivity losses caused by pests and pathogens. They play a key role in achieving sustainable food production and optimising the use of agricultural resources. This proposal explores the properties of AMIXTM technology in producing inherently healthy plants and simultaneously enhancing the activity of tank-mixed pesticides, facilitating reduced application rates; addressing the call ‘SFS-8-2015’.
The pressure to increase food production is a global phenomenon, caused primarily by increasing world population and climate change. Cereals in particular are in high demand for both food and animal feed purposes. By 2050, when the world population is estimated to reach 9 billion individuals, cereal production is projected to represent 3 billion tons per year. In particular, this challenge affects the EU’s ability to remain competitive and assure its food security, and makes food less affordable for the population. The largest cereal producers - France, Germany, Poland and the UK, add up to 160 million tonnes per year; at least 50% is estimated to be subject to loss of productivity due to the limitations imposed by both current and impending pesticide regulation. AMIXTM uniquely promotes the active uptake of nutrients (as opposed to passive absorption) together with tank-mixed pesticides at the leaf surface. It offers significant and easily measurable nutrient efficiency, consistent yield benefits even in the absence of a detectable nutrient deficiency, with uptake and translocation benefits over other formulation types. AMIXTM can: (i) reduce the amount of pesticide required; extend the effect of the pesticide, increase the effectiveness of less efficient or older generations of pesticides formulations.

Furthermore, the recent development of larger, more efficient Ultra High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) engines requires slat cut backs at the juncture of the engine pylon, which significantly promotes separation at high angles of attack. WP1.5 of Clean Sky 2 (CS2) Large Passenger Aircraft (LPA) Programme has been dedicated to addressing this very issue by developing active flow control (AFC) strategies. 
Among the various AFC techniques proposed in the literature, the pulsed jet actuator (PJA) control has been regarded as a particularly promising one as it suppression separation effectively and with much lower mass flow than the continuous blowing actuation. WINGPULSE is specifically designed to unlock the potential of the PJA technique by combining the expertise of UNOTT in wind tunnel experiments, high-fidelity simulations and control design and the cutting-edge infrastructure and expertise of large-scale flow control testing at ILOT. The overarching aim of WINGPULSE is to develop and demonstrate PJA concepts for flow separation control with efficiency beyond the state-of-the-art (reducing the net mass flow by a factor of 3-5.

Current object detection (LCOD) systems are expensive, have limited capability in terms of the size of object detected, need combined laser & radar sensor solutions to meet operator needs & generally have rotating parts requiring on-going maintenance. There are currently about 120 000 LCs in the EU. Reducing system cost & improving the performance dramatically increases the addressable LCOD market.
The Phase 1 project will deliver a detailed report providing a costed technical programme and detailed exploitation plan for the development of a low cost high performance Level Crossing obstacle detection system in phase 2 for high volume implementation in the rail market across Europe and globally.",True

"Title: INCARE - Social and gender inequalities in care: childcare-related policies and parenting practices in the post-Yugoslav countries and the role of policy ideas Abstract: Studies indicate that the middle class disproportionally benefits from social investments in childcare which target both early
childhood education and care and labour market participation of parents. Still, there is lack of comparative studies which
would deepen theoretical and policy understanding of social investment approaches applied in various countries and their
effect on childcare-related policies and via that outcomes. This project explores these issues by undertaking the first comparative study of childcare policies in the post-Yugoslav countries (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia). It explores the framing and development of entitlements to childcare-related leaves and services, the drivers of the reforms and their outcomes. It is particularly interested in (1) reform potential of the European social investment agenda to affect a redistributive dynamic in childcare and (2) parenting practices of those parents who appear to be redistributive losers of the European social investment agenda (e.g. parents with short-time contracts, unemployed). The data analysed will include national legislation and policy documents and information obtained through expert interviews and interviews with
parents. The project tackles the innovative and important topic of social inequalities in childcare, seeking to enhance the
understanding of the concept of care policy, and adds a new body of empirical evidence to the field of comparative family
policy, and gender and social inequalities studies. By developing this study at the Department of Social Policy and
Intervention at Oxford, the project will benefit from the Department`s multidisciplinary and international perspective and
expertise. For the Department the project will add new knowledge and deepen its regional focus on Central and Eastern
Europe, thus augmenting the Department`s knowledge and coverage of this part of Europe, and its focus on social inequality
studies as they relate to childcare.",False
"Title: Road2CPS - Strategic action for future CPS through roadmaps, impact multiplication and constituency building Abstract: The miniaturisation of sensing, actuating, and computing components together with the increasing number of interacting systems in strongly connected environments, and the growing complexity of such systems have triggered a paradigm shift. CPS concepts address challenges for system implementation such as increasing complexity and flexibility. These challenges and the need to optimise performance and comply with essential requirements like safety and security raise many questions that are partially addressed by current research in areas such as transport, health, production, smart grids and smart cities already. Nevertheless, there is still a huge gap between theoretical concepts, technical developments, and successful application, as well as considerable differences with regard to propagation and maturity of CPS between application domains and along the value chain. Strategic action is needed to bring the relevant stakeholders together and to facilitate mutually beneficial collaborations between them.
Road2CPS has been conceived to respond to this situation by
• Analysing impact from past and ongoing projects, identifying gaps and bridging efforts towards impact multiplication
• Developing technology, application and innovation strategy roadmaps for CPS to serve as a catalyst for early adoption of CPS technologies
• Enhancing CPS implementation and exposing exploitation opportunities via case studies 
• Developing recommendations for future research priorities and implementation strategies
• Building a CPS constituency – bringing together key players into targeted task forces to contribute to the Road2CPS action plan
This will provide European organisations with the direction required to establish their future visions of CPS environments, supporting their efforts to stay at the forefront of new developments and preparing them for future challenges in the industrial application of CPSs; thus reinforcing the leading position of the European industry in CPS.",False
"Title: COSMIC - COmbatting disorders of adaptive immunity with Systems MedICine Abstract: Background: EU countries face large health challenges to combat chronic diseases. Recently, systems medicine has emerged as a promising discipline to accelerate the translation of basic research into applications for improved diagnostics and personalized treatment. Its power arises from the integration of laboratory and computational approaches crossing research disciplines and sectors to solve clinical questions. COSMIC delivers the next generation of leading, entrepreneurial, and innovative systems medicine professionals having expertise, skills, and experience to successfully combat complex human disorders.

"Title: SmartPhoneSmartAging - Smartphones, Smart Ageing and mHealth Abstract: This project will investigate fundamental changes in people’s relationship to age and health associated with the global rise of the smartphone. The aim is to combine an intellectual challenge in understanding the contemporary nature of age and the impact of new media, with an applied challenge to use this knowledge to help make mHealth a more effective intervention. 
Through simultaneous 15 month ethnographies in China, Japan, Iran, Ireland, Nigeria and Tanzania (and supplementary work in Trinidad) a team will explore the experience of age for those between 45-70 i.e. neither clearly young nor elderly, who represent an unprecedented population that has resulted from changed life expectancy and changed aspirations. We will examine how this shift in the experience of age is impacted by the rise of smartphones that bring access to technologies associated with the young. mHealth started with youth orientated issues of fitness and wellbeing but is increasingly becoming a significant intervention in helping older populations deal with disease and frailties. mHealth has potential both for helping those with low access to professional care but also threatens to bypass and undermine professional medical services. Our aim is to complement technology led mHealth interventions with ethnography led participatory design, consisting of a collaboration between mHealth professionals with our ethnographically informed team and our informants.
The applied anthropology will inform our intellectual advances in the field of digital anthropology. Reflections on mHealth will contribute to the core aim of advancing our understanding of the experience of age in this new interstitial period of life, and to appreciate the major transformations in society and sociality represented by the new ubiquity of the smartphone. Both the intellectual and applied components will be shown to depend upon sensitivity to the forms of cultural diversity uncovered by our comparative ethnographic approach.",True
"Title: Constance - Flight Critical Wireless Slip Ring for Civil Tiltrotor Abstract: Slip rings for transferring power and data commonly form the interface between a rotating environment and a stationary domain. For aerospace applications, currently only conventional slip rings, with brushes, are on the market. The technique is proven, fairly reliable and robust, but there are clear drawbacks: wear, size and compromised signal integrity due to electrical noise.  
A few commercial wireless slip rings are now available, however not designed and certified for aerospace applications. Flight-critical applications in harsh environments require a fault-tolerant design. The future need for qualification has to be taken into account from the start of the development.
The call for proposal asks for the development of wireless slip rings for power and data transfer for a flight-critical application within the Next Generation Civil Tiltrotor (NGCTR). This CfP is a technical and industrial challenge, which provides an opportunity for improving competitiveness on this important improvement part of the NGCTR program of the CS2 work plan.
For the development of Constance, NLR will combine their tiltrotor experience from the FP5 TILTAERO and FP7 NICETRIP programs with their patented wireless slip ring design and knowledge from the Contra-Rotating Open Rotor project of the CS2 Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft program. The distinguishing feature of the Constance slip ring is the specific orientation of the rotor and stator parts of the contactless slip ring which makes the design mechanically robust, safe and fault tolerant up to high rotational speeds. For the extension towards the flight-critical application on the tiltrotor the expertise of DDC Electronics Ltd. on power converters will be fully incorporated into the proven technology.   
In Constance, three redundant slip ring assemblies with flight clearance will be delivered to the topic manager for ground and flight testing on their NGCTR and two models will be used for extensive qualification tests. Constance will end the project with TRL 6.",True
"Title: 5G!Drones - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Vertical Applications' Trials Leveraging Advanced 5G Facilities Abstract: 5G!Drones aim is to trial several UAV use-cases covering eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC 5G services, and to validate 5G KPIs for supporting such challenging use-cases. The project will drive the UAV verticals and 5G networks to a win-win position, on one hand by showing that 5G is able to guarantee UAV vertical KPIs, and on the other hand by demonstrating that 5G can support challenging use-cases that put pressure on network resources, such as low-latency and reliable communication, massive number of connections and high bandwidth requirements, simultaneously. 5G!Drones will build on top of the 5G facilities provided by the ICT-17 projects and a number of support sites, while identifying and developing the missing components to trial UAV use-cases. The project will feature Network Slicing as the key component to simultaneously run the three types of UAV services on the same 5G infrastructure (including the RAN, back/fronthaul, Core), demonstrating that each UAV application runs independently and does not affect the performance of other UAV applications, while covering different 5G services. While considering verticals will be the main users of 5G!Drones, the project will build a software layer to automate the run of trials that exposes a high level API to request the execution of a trial according to the scenario defined by the vertical, while enforcing the trial’s scenario using the API exposed by the 5G facility, as well as the 5G!Drones enablers API deployed at the facility. Thus, 5G!Drones will enable abstracting all the low-level details to run the trials for a vertical and aims at validating 5G KPIs to support several UAV use-cases via trials using a 5G shared infrastructure, showing that 5G supports the performance requirements of UAVs with several simultaneous UAV applications with different characteristics (eMBB, uRLLC and mMTC). Using the obtained results, 5G!Drones will allow the UAV association to make recommendations for further improvements on 5G.",True
"Title: selfBACK - A decision support system for self-management of low back pain Abstract: The recent global burden of disease study showed that low back pain (LBP) is the most significant contributor to disability in Europe. Most patients seen in primary care with LBP have non-specific LBP (≥85%), i.e., pain that cannot reliably be attributed to a specific disease/pathology. LBP is the fourth most common diagnosis seen in primary care (after upper respiratory infection, hypertension, and coughing). Self-management in the form of physical activity and strength/stretching exercises constitutes the core component in the management of non-specific LBP; however, adherence to self-management challenging due to lack of feedback and reinforcement. This project aims to develop a decision support system - SELFBACK - that will be used by the patient him/herself to facilitate, improve and reinforce self-management of LBP. Specifically, SELFBACK will be designed to assist the patient in deciding and reinforcing the appropriate actions to manage own LBP after consulting a health care professional in primary care. The decision support will be conveyed to the patient via a smartphone app in the form of advice for self-management. The advice will be tailored to each patient based on the symptom state, symptom progression, the patients goal-setting, and a range of patient characteristics including information from a physical activity-detecting wristband worn by the patient. The second part of the project will evaluate the effectiveness of SELFBACK in a randomized controlled trial using pain-related disability as primary outcome. We envisage that patients who use SELFBACK will have 20% reduction in pain-related disability at 9 months follow-up compared to patients receiving treatment as usual. Process evaluation will be carried out as an integrated part of the trial to document the implementation and map the patients’ satisfaction with SELFBACK. A business plan with a targeted commercialisation strategy will be developed to transfer the SELFBACK technology into the market.",True
"Title: MeGa - DNA Methylation dynamics during Gastrulation Abstract: A fundamental aspect of biology is the understanding of how cell fates are established and maintained. Although it is widely accepted that epigenetic reprogramming is a central process of mammalian development, one of the most intriguing questions that remains unanswered is how DNA methylation marks contribute to cell differentiation and lineage commitment. By combining, novel single cell genomics techniques, CRISPR/dCas9 technology and innovative analytical approaches, this project will uncover the links between DNA methylation, gene expression and cell fate decisions during mouse gastrulation. This information will be used in a novel way to identify methylation signatures responsible for the stable repression of pluripotency, which has great potential to advance the development of safe iPS cells. Furthermore, this proposal will implement two innovative approaches utilising single cell DNA methylation patterns to reconstruct lineage trajectories of individual cells. This project capitalises on the unique combination of my novel analytical approaches, my background in DNA methylation analysis and evolutionary biology together with the extensive expertise in single cell techniques and developmental biology of the host lab. This multidisciplinary proposal will provide critical insights into how information is encoded in the epigenome and what this information can tell us about a cell’s history within a developing organism. These results will significantly advance the field of epigenetics, developmental and stem cell biology. Finally, the knowledge and skills gained from this project combined with my scientific and personal development will hopefully open up exciting career possibilities with the long-term goal to establish my own research group in Europe.",False
"Title: TeSeR - Technology for Self Removal of Spacecraft Abstract: Orbital space is getting increasingly crowded and a few collision events could jeopardize activities in important orbits and
cause significant damage to the infrastructure in space. As a preventive measure to be included in future S/C, TeSeR
proposes a universal post mission disposal module to be carried into orbit by any S/C to ensure its proper disposal after
ending its service lifetime, be it planned or unscheduled due to S/C failure. This module shall be independent of the S/C.
Principal aims of TeSeR are to
1. develop a removal module beginning with the exploration of concepts, going for a functional design with the aim to
manufacture and test an on-ground prototype module which demonstrates the main functions
2. perform a thorough qualitative and quantitative mission analysis of existing removal concepts
3. develop a ground breaking new semi-controlled removal concept based on a passive removal concept which ensures the
deorbit of a large S/C (>1 t) into the Pacific Ocean without a propulsion system but with an accuracy of a fraction of one orbit
4. advance and manufacture removal subsystems prototypes, for controlled, semi-controlled and uncontrolled disposal,
based on already existing technology with the focus on scalability and standardized implementation to the removal module via a common interface
5. analyse the feasibility and potential advantages of multi-purpose concepts of the module and its removal subsystems (e.g.
shielding by deployable structures)
6. perform a market study and define a business case for TeSeR
7. use TeSeR as leverage to propose changes in legal aspects and advanced state of the art licensing standard for
spacecraft including the improvement of international debris mitigation guidelines and standards",True
"Title: NEVERMIND - NEurobehavioural predictiVE and peRsonalised Modelling of depressIve symptoms duriNg primary somatic Diseases with ICT-enabled self-management procedures Abstract: Personal health systems for the management of chronic diseases have seen giant leaps in development over recent years. These systems offer vital sign monitoring and therapy delivery at home, focusing on the primary physical disease conditions. However, they do not provide support for early mood assessment or psychological treatment and lack a real-time comprehensive assessment of the patient’s mental status. 
Depression is the third leading contributor to global diseases, and depressive mood state is also considered to be strictly related to the onset or worsening of a severe primary somatic disease. Indeed effective preventive medicine related to the onset of depressive symptoms as a comorbidity and worsening factor of psychosomatic diseases such as myocardial infarction, leg-amputation, cancer, and kidney failure is lacking. 
NEVERMIND sets out to empower people who suffer from symptoms of depression related to a serious somatic disease by placing them at the center of their mental healthcare. Equipped with just a smartphone and a lightweight sensitized shirt, patients seeking care and treatment for their mental illnesses interact with these devices that collect data about their mental and physical health, to then get effective feedback. Lifestyle factors, i.e. diet, physical activity and sleep hygiene, play a significant mediating role in the development, progression and treatment of depression, and in NEVERMIND will be monitored by a real-time Decision Support System running locally on the patient’s smartphone, predicting the severity and onset of depressive symptoms, by processing physiological data, body movement, speech, and the recurrence of social interactions. The data will trigger a response encouraging the patient to conduct or alter activities or lifestyle to reduce the occurrence and severity of depressive symptoms. 
The final aim is to bring this system to the market, giving people the tools to control their depression and unburden their minds.",True
"Title: HypoTRAIN - Hyporheic Zone Processes – A training network for enhancing the understanding of complex physical, chemical and biological process interactions Abstract: Hyporheic zones (HZs) are key compartments for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. As dynamic and complex transition regions between rivers and aquifers, they are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple physical, biological and chemical processes. Turnover and degradation of nutrients and pollutants figure among the prominent ecological services the HZ provides. We are facing a significant knowledge gap in the understanding of how hyporheic processes are linked and how they impact on each other. This can be attributed to a lack of truly supra-disciplinary research and harmonized and innovative investigation methods.

The concept of HypoTRAIN has been tailored to fill this gap. Collaborative research with state-of-the art technologies from multiple disciplines (hydrology, ecology, microbiology, engineering, environmental physics, contaminant science, modelling) will generate new mechanistic insights into the functioning of HZs. A group of ESRs will be educated using the multi-faceted nature of HZs as the central theme of the training programme. The supra-disciplinary expertise within the network and the high-level training program will generate scientific knowledge that will set the ground for a more holistic design of river management plans and restoration measures. Research excellence as well as scientific and technological innovation is ensured as all partners have world-leading reputations and work at the forefront of their respective discipline areas.

Participating in HypoTRAIN will make ESRs highly attractive for employers and open up doors for their successful careers in research, regulation, consulting, and industry. They will be experts for the better assessment of the ecological and chemical status of surface waters and for providing successful river restoration and management strategies. The strong involvement of the non-academic sector will provide the ESRs with a holistic perspective on career opportunities.",False
"Title: ECSASDPE - European and Chinese Platform for Stacked Aero-Structure Drilling Process and Equipment Abstract: Weight reduction and cost savings have driven composites research towards a number of recent high profile achievements. The increased use of anisotropic AL/CFRP/Ti stacks in aircraft structures has in turn created enormous challenges for the industry due to the difficulties that arise from drilling these heterogeneous stack materials. The project “European and Chinese Platform for Stacked Aero-Structure Drilling Process and Equipment (ECSASDPE)” focuses on the staff exchange between the partners of EU and China, and the development of key enabling techniques and equipment for theorbital drilling process of stacked AL/CFRP/Ti. It meets the objectives and requirements of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions: Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE), by establishing multiple bridges between European and Chinese institutions.
The ultimate goal of ECSASDPE is to set up a long-term international and inter-sector collaboration consortium through research and innovation staff exchanges between 8 world-recognised institutions in the cutting-edge research area of high value manufacturing with promising applications in scientific and engineering sectors. The synergistic methodologies achieved by ECSASDPE will serve as the building blocks of the stacked composite materialmachining mechanism, equipment design, process monitor and control, and machining quality metrology and characterisation and scale up application, and thus enhance the leading position of the consortium for the scientific and technological progresses in high value manufacturing. This project is divided into six inter-related work packages: (1) Setup of knowledge base and road mapping; (2) Fundamentals of drilling process; (3) Key techniques for Equipment development; (4) System integration and performance verification; (5) Dissemination and exploitation, and (6) Project management.

"Title: BilProcess - French-English bilinguals' processing of morphosyntactic structures: the case of cross-linguistic transfer Abstract: One question central to both bilingual first language acquisition (2L1) and second language development (L2) research is to understand the mechanisms that lead to systematic interaction between the languages, i.e. cross-linguistic influence (CLI). To-date, we know that bilinguals’ two languages are continuously co-activated to some extent at the lexicon and sentence level. Bilinguals need to map different syntactic forms, i.e. one or more for each language, onto the same discourse function, which occasionally leads to the entrenchment of the non-targetlike form. Yet, little is known about how the age of acquisition (2L1 vs. L2) and language dominance (expressive abilities, language exposure) affect the processing mechanisms governing this phenomenon. 
This project focuses on an aspect of morphosyntactic development (the article system) known to be particularly challenging for both bilingual children and adults. It adopts a unique comparative approach to investigate whether simultaneous French-English bilingual children’s and L2 adult bilinguals’ sentence comprehension is affected by the parallel activation of the article system in specific and generic contexts in two studies using the self-paced moving window method. French is a very restrictive language and requires the projection of a determiner in argument position. In contrast, English allows bare mass nouns and bare plural nouns in non-specific and generic contexts. These cross-linguistic differences will allow us to test (i) whether the co-activation of distinct morphosyntactic forms (article system) depending on the semantic context (specific vs. generic) leads to language interference in French-English bilinguals’ comprehension of sentence structure; (ii) the role of language exposure vs. productive measures of the relative language dominance on the direction and magnitude of cross-linguistic transfers; (iii) to what extent this phenomenon operates differently depending on the age of language acquisition.",False
"Title: Tangi0 - Touch and pressure sensitive material without electronic sensors for intuitive and eye-free control of a car’s features while driving Abstract: Current in-car controls have many individual components and parts included, making them very costly to assemble. If even one of the parts fails the controls won’t work and car models could be recalled by the factory to have to fix the issue. The assembled components are difficult to take apart and need to go through a timely, costly process to be recycled and not be turned into e-waste. The main problem behind in-car controls are that they cause significant distractions to drivers which has been found the cause of 80% of road traffic accidents. The problem is only becoming worse with infotainment displays imbedded with multiple lights and sensors and controls being inputted through a large touch-screen device.
Tangi0 have developed a new method for operating controls in the cockpit of cars through an intuitive, tactile material with distinctive shapes that allow drivers to operate it eye-free. This reduces the safety hazards of driving distractions. Using a touch-sensitive, conductive material also means that there is a huge reduction in electronic components needed in the product making a much cheaper, environmentally friendly.
Following a very promising preliminary validation of the innovative technology with Jaguar-Land Rover, Tangi0 now intend to develop and design the integrated system and fully commercialize the solution by reaching the market in 2021. Incorporated in the UK in 2015 with its core business in the European automotive market with a revenue of €200K, £450K in funding and a staff headcount of 8.
The proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME instrument fits into the overall Tangi0 plan to reach market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a fast, sound and wider deployment of the solution and the market uptake. It will also allow the SME to accomplish key feasibility activities and reduce the business risks, such as business planning, customer identification and outreach, and stronger IP management strategy.",True
"Title: ARIES - Accelerator Research and Innovation for European Science and Society Abstract: Particle accelerators are essential tools for delivering excellence in many scientific fields and are widely used in industrial, healthcare and other applications. The demand of pushing further their scientific reach and of reinforcing their impact on society results in new challenges that must be addressed in the years to come: existing infrastructures are stretched to all performance frontiers, several world-class accelerator-based facilities on the ESFRI roadmap are under construction, and strategic decisions are needed for future accelerator facilities, to be realised on a global scale. 
To address these challenges, ARIES brings together a consortium of 41 beneficiaries from 18 countries: accelerator laboratories, technology institutes, universities and industrial partners to jointly address common challenges for the benefit of a number of projects and infrastructures in high-energy physics, as well as in photon and neutron science.

"Title: CORRELATION - Characterization and prediction of service-level traffic for future sliced mobile network Abstract: Network slicing is a key enabling technology for the 5th generation (5G) and beyond mobile networks. Network slicing allows the creation of multiple logical network instances on the same underlying physical network. Slices can then be formed or combined on-demand, with parameters optimized according to various service requirements so as to meet the users’ instant requests for specific mobile services. Hence, the performance of network slicing heavily depends on characterizing and predicting the spatial- temporal traffic patterns for individual services in near real-time. 

Research on characterization and prediction for service-level mobile traffic is still in nascence. Firstly, the traffic characteristics and predicting methods of individual services, especially the 5G services, have not been studied adequately. Secondly, traffic correlation among different services and the reasons behind it have not been well studied. Thirdly, inter-service correlations have not been well exploited in service-level mobile traffic prediction. 

In this project, we will address these gaps. Firstly, we will study the spatial-temporal characteristics of service-level traffic patterns at multi-scales, based on which, we will investigate the traffic predicting frameworks for individual services. Secondly, for the first time, we will investigate the traffic correlation among different services and try to discover the underlying reasons by analyzing the service usage profiles of different user groups. Finally, based on inter-service correlations, we will investigate whether we can improve service-level traffic prediction accuracy and whether we could execute prediction for diverse services according to the historical records of only a few key services.

The success of the CORRELATION project will make proactive network slicing possible, which will then drive proactive network optimisation for 5G and beyond mobile networks.",True

"Title: ImagePlanetFormDiscs - Imaging the Dynamical Imprints of Planet Formation in Protoplanetary Discs Abstract: The gas and dust discs around young stars are thought to be the birthplace of planetary systems and are a key area to study if further progress is to be made on understanding the history of our solar system and our own origins. Once planets have formed in these discs, they dynamically sculpt their environment, for instance by opening tidally-cleared gaps or triggering spiral arms and disc warps. The late stages of this process are likely observed in the “transitional” discs, where regions spanning tens of astronomical units (AU) have been cleared. The aim of this project is to image the planet formation signatures both during the transitional disc and the earlier T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be stars phase, where the protoplanetary bodies are just starting to carve gaps in the optically thick disc. For this purpose, we will employ the latest generation of near-infrared, mid-infrared, and sub-millimeter interferometric instruments that will allow us to trace a wide range of stellocentric radii, disc scale heights, and dust opacities. We will make use of recent revolutionary advancements in infrared detector technology and equip the CHARA/MIRC 6-telescope beam combiner with a low-read noise camera that will significantly increase the sensitivity of this instrument and enable us to image protoplanetary discs with 2.5 times higher resolution and much higher efficiency than ever before. These quick-look imaging capabilities will enable us to trace time-variable structures in the inner few AU and to investigate their relation to the commonly observed photometric and spectroscopic variability. Our interferometric observations in spectral lines aim to detect the accretion signatures of the young protoplanets themselves. Employing sophisticated radiation hydrodynamics simulations we will achieve an unprecedented global view on protoplanetary disc structure and obtain fundamentally new constraints on theoretical models of planet formation, planet-disc interaction, and disc evolution.",False
"Title: OnTrack - Development of a commercial manufacturing process for embeddable RFID and NFC Tags for complete lifecycle tracking of tyres Abstract: Europe’s tyre manufacturing and re-treading industries are under increasing threat from imported tyres mainly from China. The EU re-treading industry is valued at €1.2bn (2015) but is declining due to the influx of Chinese tyres leading to the loss of highly-skilled jobs.

The low-cost imported tyres cost on average €80 per tyre compared to €300-500 from a premium manufacturer. The temptation to buy these low-cost tyres is clear, however they are manufactured from poor quality materials with tread patterns that underperform. The ethos of cheap tyres is ‘use and replace’, whereas premium tyres are built to be re-treaded to increase lifetime. As a result, imported tyres are not cost effective over the lifetime of the tyres due to poor fuel economy and performance. Use of premium tyres and re-treading over the use and replace model needs to be encouraged to increase safety and fuel efficiency.

Silent Sensors are an innovative IoT company that are working on a tyre traceability solution to remove the logistical burden of re-treading for FOs. We are manufacturing UHF/NFC RFID tags ‘OnTrack’ to embed directly into tyres which provides each tyre with a permanent, unique ID for life. Our tags can store data from the manufacturing process and key events during operational use such as repairs etc. This comprehensive history for each tyre makes it easier for FOs to plan their tyre re-treads. This data also makes the re-tread process simpler as the tyre history will speed-up integrity tests.

OnTrack is the only tyre traceability solution that offers NFC – empowering employees to interrogate tyres with just a smartphone. We have a clear market opportunity with OnTrack to supply up to 40m tags/annum to a single tyre manufacturer.

"Title: NPTC - New Perspectives in Tropospheric Chemistry Abstract: The last two hundred years have seen new anthropogenic emissions dramatically change the chemical composition and chemistry of the troposphere, creating a diverse set of atmospheric conditions based on location and level of human population. Reducing climate change and reversing the negative impacts humans have on the atmosphere is a clear European Commission target moving forward towards 2020. Alkenes are common to pristine, clean air environments (biogenic sources) and polluted, urban environments (anthropogenic emissions). The removal of alkenes from the troposphere predominantly occurs through reaction with ozone, generating a wide range of products including OH, CO and CO2, which have a significant impact upon the chemistry of Earth’s atmosphere. Despite the abundance of alkenes in the atmosphere, the atmospheric ozonolysis of alkenes is still poorly understood. 
Dr Beames intends to use this Fellowship to build a new research group at Cardiff University, using advanced physical chemistry techniques to study an elusive intermediate species in these ozonolysis reactions, which are known as Criegee intermediates (carbonyl oxides). Criegee intermediates are a dominant source of night-time OH• (a ‘tropospheric detergent’) and are implicated in aerosol formation.  These species have only recently been directly detected, and have become a hot topic in both atmospheric chemistry and physical chemistry fields. During his time as a Dreyfus Post Doctoral Fellow in Environmental Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr Beames pioneered the spectroscopic research on Criegee intermediates, leading to several high profile publications. He will continue to investigate their chemistry, and their role in aerosol formation, using novel, highly selective and sensitive, infrared cavity ring down spectroscopy. This will combine his existing knowledge of infrared spectroscopy and cavity ring down spectroscopy.",False
"Title: MMAP-VEX - Measuring and Modelling Air Pollution Within Vehicles – Implications for daily EXposure and Human Health. Abstract: Outdoor air pollution is accountable for at least 4.2 million deaths per year worldwide, whilst more than 80% of urban residents are exposed to outdoor air pollution levels greater than the legislative limits. As this outdoor polluted air undergoes exchange with the air inside vehicle cabins, vehicle occupants may suffer elevated exposure to ambient/outdoor air pollutants of varying extents during this time. Additionaly, personal air pollution exposure within vehicles varies not only under different ventilation settings, but also during time of the day and road type. MMAP-VEX project aims to investigate how the outdoor air quality is a determinable factor of health and personal air pollution exposure in passenger cars. MMAP-VEX will perform concurrent measurements of air pollutants within vehicles and directly outside/ambient of multiple air pollutants such as concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, PM1 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10, 2.5 and 1 µm, respectively), ultrafine particles (UFP, with aerodynamic diameter < 300 nm), lung surface deposited area (LSDA), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are critical species in terms of air pollution exposure comparisons. The concurent measurements will take place under different ventilation settings on  urban, sub-urban and rural roads. The insights from these experiments, while significant themselves, will then be used to develop modelling techniques, which, with the use of the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, will be trained in order to estimate personal exposure inside vehicle cabins under different conditions such as cold/hot weather, air conditioning on/off or driving in urban/rural roads. MMAP-VEX research is critical for effective indoor air quality management policies, alternative, greener commuting strategies and control of daily exposure to air pollution.",False
"Title: ORPHEUS - Object-based broadcasting – for European leadership in next generation audio experiences Abstract: Object-based media is a revolutionary approach for creating and deploying interactive, personalised, scalable and immersive content, by representing it as a set of individual assets together with metadata describing their relationships and associations. This allows media objects to be assembled in groundbreaking ways to create new user experiences. Based on this paradigm, ORPHEUS specifically identified the, often neglected, audio sector to have high innovation potential.

ORPHEUS will develop, implement and validate a completely new end-to-end object-based media chain for audio content. The partners will lay the foundation for facilitating infinite combinations of audio objects in ways that are flexible and responsive to user, environmental and platform-specific factors. This includes innovative tools for capturing, mixing, monitoring, storing, archiving, playing out, distributing and rendering object-based audio.

Many media companies, including partners of this project, are ready to adopt this next-generation media representation but the challenges of real-world implementation and integration are yet to be tackled.

ORPHEUS will deliver a sustainable solution, ensuring that workflows and components for object-based audio scale up to enable cost-effective commercial production, storage, re-purposing, play-out and distribution. The ultimate aim is to bring the fascinating experience of object-based content to mass audiences at no added cost. ORPHEUS will demonstrate the new prodigious user experience through the realisation of close-to-market workflows, proofing the economic viability of object-based audio as an emerging media and broadcast technology. Collectively, the project partners encompass all knowledge and skills necessary to achieve these objectives.

To further foster the development of new capabilities in the European content creation industry, ORPHEUS will publish a reference architecture and guidelines on how to implement object-based audio chains.",True
"Title: EQR-Equid - Real Time, Secure Equine ID Information Platform (EQR-Equid) Abstract: Criminal activities associated with horse and ponies are widespread across Europe. Horses and ponies are principally identified by a paper based ‘passport’, and/or micro-chip, or branding.  Passports are hand written and therefore prone to error, falsification and fraud. They can easily be ‘recycled’ from dead animals allowing contaminated horsemeat to enter the human food chain. Likewise, micro-chips can easily be removed or cloned. Purchasers of equidae have little assurance that ‘their animal’ is the one in the passport.

Equine Register Ltd. are developing an exciting new equine identification method for vets, government agencies, welfare organisations and horse owners - EQR-Equid. Our solution uses an inclusive secure, remote-access data system underpinned by smart behavioural pattern recognition algorithms, that can automatically identify disease spread, criminal activity, missing animals and compliance issues. Via an intuitive interface, EQR-Equid allows equine sector stakeholders to identify and track an animal securely from anywhere, at any time, whilst enabling enforcement agencies to target their resources. EQR-Equid’s accuracy, connectivity and immediacy will deliver increases in animal welfare, animal value, compliance and data confidence whilst reducing the opportunity for fraudulent activity.

The objective of our overall innovation project is to develop EQR-Equid for sale to those involved in the trade, enforcement, and welfare of equidae. The specific objectives of our Phase I project are to carry out a feasibility study to enable us to create a clear path for market replication.  Our sales forecast shows a projected turnover of €6.3m by 2023, 5 years after launch. The revenue will allow us to extend the concept to other animals, and grow Equine Register Ltd. as an SME.",True
"Title: PRO GAIT - Physiological and Rehabilitation Outcomes: Gains from Automated Interventions in stroke Therapy (PRO GAIT) Abstract: Developments in robotics allow people with profound neuromuscular deficits after stroke to walk with assistance (during the gait cycle) using an exoskeleton robot. Integrating a robotic device with individualised user electroencephalography (EEG /electrical activity in the motor areas in the brain) and EMG (muscle)feedback would allow more physiological and targeted gait parameters in response to effort, and  confer neuroplastic training effects including neuromodulation of temporal and spatial features of gait.
Future integration of EEG/EMGsignals with robotic devices will allow patient initiated movement through thought and/or attempted effort, where currently parameters for devices are therapist set and usage is not functionally driven by the patient. Advancement in this regard is stalled primarily because of difficulty in 3D modelling of gait by EEG. 
This collaborative consortium through secondments and return and built in knowledge sharing strategies will exchange knowledge and expertise across: Design, development and production of exoskeleton gait devices; neuro-rehabilitation; bioelectric EEG/EMG signal capture and interpretation; mathematical modelling and brain computer interface (BCI) platform development can advance the state of the art in gait rehabilitation after stroke rehabilitation. The proposal  will allow development of 3D modelling of gait, for gait restoration  and explore integration  with robotics from multi-stakeholder perspectives.
Aims:
1. Define current state of the art in EEG modelling of gait post stroke by systematic review and meta-synthesis
2. Complete 3D modelling of gait as visualised gait, overground gait and robotic walking in healthy individuals and stroke survivors
3. Develop and test a virtual reality BCI gait training device, including end-user feedback
4. Explore integration of this prototype with robotic software platforms",False
"Title: NOVACHIP - Novel vascular-like BBB-on-a-chip Abstract: There is great need to develop safer and more biologically relevant models for drug screening. Recent reports indicate that up to 20% of acute kidney complications can be linked to drug-induced nephrotoxicity and more than 40 molecules found to reduce Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)-related plaques in animal models were shown to be ineffective in AD patients. It is increasingly evident that both in vitro and in vivo models being used to develop drugs have a limited capacity to predict the pathophysiology of human disease, personalized response, and off-target drug toxicity. The inability to properly test drugs and treatments to diseases such as AD constitutes a risk for pharmaceutical companies and a major obstacle to overcome. This ERC PoC proposal aims to establish a practical microfluidic fabrication process capable of recreating structural and biomechanical features of native blood vessels. Specifically, we aim to develop a scalable 3D Blood-Brain-Barrier in vitro model (BBB-on-a-chip) able to provide a higher level of biological relevance than current in vitro models. The development of such a system would represent a major break-through for the pharmaceutical industry generating therapies for a variety of neurological disorders. Thanks to the ERC Starting Grant STROFUNSCAFF, we have developed a simple fabrication process that combines bioprinting and self-assembly to grow functional fluidic devices with endothelialized vessel-like capillaries (patent application in preparation). NOVACHIP proposes to a) build scalable microfluidic devices made from capillaries that incorporate relevant cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, exhibit tissue-like stiffness, and can be designed with specific sizes and geometries to better resemble the native BBB and b) compare it to a commercially available in vitro model as well as c) an established rat model by quantifying permeability of specific imaging biomarkers for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique.",False
"Title: SmokeFreeBrain - Multidisciplinary tools for improving the efficacy of public prevention measures against smoking Abstract: Smoking is the largest avoidable cause of preventable morbidity worldwide. It causes most of the cases of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to the development of other lung diseases. The control of smoking is considered as a highly important intervention for the prevention of lung diseases. Tobacco consumption is highly influenced by socioeconomic factors. SmokeFreeBrain aims to address the effectiveness of a multi-level variety of interventions aiming at smoking cessation in high risk target groups within High Middle Income Countries (HMIC) such as unemployed young adults, COPD and asthma patients, as well as within the general population in Low Middle Income Countries (LMIC). The project addresses existing approaches aiming to prevent lung diseases caused by tobacco while at the same time it develops new treatments and analyzes their contextual adaptability to the local and global health care system. 
SmokeFreeBrain follows an interdisciplinary approach exploiting consortium’s expertise in various relevant fields in order to generate new knowledge. State of the art techniques in toxicology, pulmonary medicine, neuroscience and behavior will be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of: (i) Public Service Announcement (PSA) against smoking, (ii) the use of electronic cigarettes with and without nicotine as a harm reduction approach and/or cessation aid, (iii) a specifically developed neurofeedback intervention protocol against smoking addiction, (iv) a specifically developed intervention protocol based on behavioral therapy, social media/mobile apps and short text messages (sms) and (v) pharmacologic interventions. The main objective of the project is to evaluate the interventions in terms of health economics, by studying their cost-effectiveness, and proposing a scalable plan and a clear pathway to embedding the proposed interventions into policy and practice both in LMIC as well as in HMIC.",True
"Title: ELSAH - Electronic smart patch system for wireless monitoring of molecular biomarkers for healthcare and well-being Abstract: ELSAH realizes a flexible and integrated, smart patch-based, wearable sensor system for continuous monitoring of health and well-being that quantifies biomarkers by electrochemical detection. This system will be fully self-sustained by integrating microneedle biosensors with a microchip, a printed battery and printed electronics, thereby enabling independent measurements and secure wireless data transmission to the user’s mobile phone. The ELSAH-patch will comprise: 1) Simultaneous electrochemical quantification of glucose and lactate concentrations in the interstitial fluid; 2) Total monitoring period of at least 24 hours at a measurement interval of no more than 5 minutes; 3) Total patch area of no more than 16 cm2 at a maximum patch thickness of 4 mm; 4) Choice of components and integration process that enable fabrication costs of a post-project commercial version of no more than 2 € per patch. 
We will realize three generations of the ELSAH-patch system with consecutively increasing integration levels. The first generation will be a platform system assembled from interchangeable standard components, while the last generation will provide the final modular solution which integrates advanced components and interfaces.
To achieve the objectives, the ELSAH consortium unites the individual innovative strengths in advanced electronics technologies of five research, three SME and two large industry partners. They will generate added value by jointly developing an entirely new integrated bio-electronic smart system with strong market potential, thereby supporting the digitisation of Europe’s industry.
The ELSAH-patch constitutes a new ESS generation that will enable for the first time the cost-effective and minimally invasive self-testing of molecular biomarker levels by integrating individual hardware technologies across multiple fields, namely: 1) Polymeric microneedles manufacturing; 2) Electrochemical biosensors; 3) Printed electronics; 4) Advanced processing.",True
"Title: HEAR-ECO - HEAR-ECO Innovative Hearing Aid Research - Ecological Conditions and Outcome Measures Abstract: In today’s ageing European population, hearing impairment is an increasing concern for public health and societal participation. The percentage of hearing-impaired people will rise from around 16% of the adult EU population now to around 40% in 2030. Hearing aid (HA) fitting is the most widely prescribed solution for hearing impairment. However, only around 30%-40% of adults with hearing impairment use HAs in daily life. One of the reasons for this is that methods used to develop and evaluate HAs are still not based on conditions in which HAs are actually used. Thus the potential of improved HA technology to meet the needs of individual users in their daily lives is acutely under-exploited. The science in HEAR-ECO will help to facilitate the paradigm shift which is needed to bridge the gap. Such a paradigm shift requires a new generation of hearing scientists that are able to integrate conventional Audiology with Motivational and Social psychology (motivation to listen, cognition), Psychophysiology (pupillometry, PEP, EEG), and HA technology. HEAR-ECO will train six ESRs capable of spanning these disciplines and translating their knowledge into innovative technological HA evaluation and development. The six ESRs will be trained through local training at academic partners in The Netherlands and the UK and secondment to one of the largest hearing aid manufacturers in the world in Denmark – and through network wide training, including an associated partner in Liverpool. The ESRs will be capable of developing and combining new tools and outcome measures for realistic everyday communication and translating this to innovative technological HA evaluation and development.",False
"Title: Mo-IoNT - Molecular Communications for Internet of Nano-Things Abstract: The Internet-of-Nano-Things (IoNT) paradigm has the potential to dramatically transform society and is recognised as one of the top 10 emerging technologies by the World Economic Forum. In order to connect nano-scale devices, this timely fellowship will focus on molecular signalling, which underpins multi-scale coordinated biological actions. Despite its prevalent nature, we do not yet understand the information carrying potential of molecular signals in complex and multi-scale fluids, nor do we know how to design credible communication protocols. Inspired by these challenges, the objectives of this fellowship are: (1) bridge fluid dynamic and communication theory knowledge by combining complex fluid dynamic experiments with molecular communication testing, and (2) design and test innovative capacity achieving communication protocols in complex diffusion-advection environments. The experienced applicant and the scientist-in-charge have the joint ambitious vision to achieve fundamental understanding of the underpinning science through the co-creation of inter-disciplinary knowledge. The project will provide career accelerating training and knowledge transfer and enable the applicant to become a world leader in molecular communications and create sustainable societal impact.",False
"Title: FashionBrain - Understanding Europe’s Fashion Data Universe Abstract: The primary goal of each retailer is to “understand your customers”. Our interviews with retailers show a primary demand from the retail industry for predicting a customer's next demand. Surprisingly , even a complete record of past purchases (and returns) is not sufficient to understand how items in a company's catalog do or do not connect with the customer's general tastes, lifestyle and aspirations. Moverover, from a business perspective, any efficiency gains in the logistics of supplier management, shipping and handling are  rather minor, compared to the gains one could obtain from a better understanding of the customers’ personalities and habits. Given that the customer demands trigger proactive stocking and fashion production, this appears as a logical consequence. 
In this project, we want to consolidate and extend existing European technologies in the area of database management, data mining, machine learning, image processing, information retrieval, and crowdsourcing to strengthen the positions of European fashion retailers among their world-wide competitors. Our choice for the fashion sector is a concise one: i) as a multi-billion euro industry, the fashion sector is extremely important for the European economy; ii) Europe already has a solid position in the world fashion stage, however, to maintain its position and keep up with the competitors, European fashion industry needs the help of advanced technology; and iii) European fashion industry provides an excellent exercise for new technologies, because it is a multi-sectorial by itself (i.e., imposes challenging data integration issues), it has a short life-cycle (i.e., requires timely reaction to the current events) and it involves diverse languages and cultures.
The main outcome of the FashionBrain project is the improvement of the fashion industry value chain obtained thanks to the creation of novel on-line shopping experiences, the detection of influencers, and the prediction of upcoming fashion trends. Tangible outcomes will include software, demonstrators, and novel algorithms for a data-driven fashion industry.",False
"Title: PD_Pal - Palliative care in Parkinson’s disease Abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized in its advanced stages by motor and non-motor complications causing progressive loss of autonomy in activities of daily living, poor quality of life, marked caregiver distress, and high utilization of medical services. Similar to cancer patients, albeit for much longer duration, PD patients have considerable (and mounting) unmet physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs, and experience great problems with continuity of care.
The overall ambition of PD_Pal is to validate a new model of palliative care which would be easily integrated with traditional management when disability limits mobility and independence. PD_Pal will provide an added layer of support to patients, their loved ones, and treating clinicians.
PD_Pal randomised controlled trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of specialized, multidisciplinary, outpatient palliative care intervention (Advance Care Planning) in improving family satisfaction, symptom management and quality of life. PD_Pal will also further prove the feasibility and economic sustainability of this approach by the active involvement of patients lay associations as well relevant medical societies. 
PD_Pal team includes leading experts in both neurology and palliative care with key-roles in both national and international PD working groups. PD_Pal will develop a new set of evidence-based Guidelines and a Massive Online Course (MOOC) for Palliative Care in PD involving in the process experts from the European Association for Palliative Care, the European Academy of Neurology and the Movement Disorders Society. Thus, PD_Pal is best positioned to transfer this knowledge to all European countries and ensure that “PD_Pal Guidelines” will translate into best practice. The PD_Pal MOOC “Best Care for People with Late Stage Parkinson” will be integrated into the WHO supported interdisciplinary post-graduate palliative care curriculum.",False
"Title: COREGAL - Combined Positioning-Reflectometry Galileo Code Receiver for Forest Management Abstract: Biomass mapping has gained increased interest for bioenergy, climate research and mitigation activities, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (e.g. REDD initiative).

However, continuous deforestation activity and forest management requires frequent and accurate monitoring which can be expensive and difficult to attain. In Brazil, optical satellite data is typically used by government but even such does not allow accurate enough mapping due cloud coverage, requiring combination of other sources such as in-situ and air-borne measurements. Furthermore, satellite radar signals can penetrate clouds but still today the spatial resolution is not sufficient.

In COREGAL, a low cost unmanned fixed-plane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and service for biomass mapping will allow wide scale mapping in the Brazilian context of forest management. A first of a kind combined Position-Reflectometry Galileo receiver will be developed as main sensor for platform positioning and biomass estimation, the latter using reflected GNSS signals (also called GNSS-R) on tree canopies. High positioning accuracy (centimetre level) is required for surface point reflection determination, which is challenging for remote areas where no GNSS infrastructure is available as in the case of many forests in Brazil. However, Galileo AltBOC E5 signals offer unprecedented pseudorange measurement quality which can be used for novel high accuracy positioning.

The UAV will be equipped and tested with a COREGAL receiver and optical cameras for aerial mapping and biomass estimation, enabling wide scale low cost mapping: UAV mapping is at least one order of magnitude lower cost than manned air-borne missions while GNSS-R can be seen as bi-static radar replacing expensive, heavy and power consuming radars. 

The consortium includes universities and companies for successful services and technology exploitation.",True
